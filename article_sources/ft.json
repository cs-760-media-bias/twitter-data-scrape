  "text": "Today, I am taking historic action to promote Israel's ability to defend itself, and really, to have a very powerful, very strong national security, which they're entitled to have. In a moment, I will sign a presidential proclamation recognising Israel's sovereign right over the Golan Heights. The state of Israel took control of the Golan Heights in 1967 to safeguard its security from external threats.\n\nToday, aggressive action by Iran and terrorist groups in southern Syria, including Hezbollah, continue to make the Golan Heights a potential launching ground for attacks against Israel. Very violent attacks. Any possible future peace agreement must account for Israel's need to defend itself from Syria, Iran, and other regional threats. We do not want to see another attack like the one suffered this morning, north of Tel Aviv.\n\nBut Israel has never had a better friend than you. Thank you for your leadership, thank you for your friendship, and thank you for all you've done to make the alliance between America and Israel stronger and greater than ever.\n\nThis was a long time in the making. Should have taken place many decades ago. And maybe you can give this to the people in Israel for me.\n\nThank you.\n\n[APPLAUSE]"

  "title": "Expat advice: moving to Santiago, Chile",
  "authors": [],
  "text": "Good food and schools are plentiful but out in the desert the stargazing is unmissable\n\nBy Mark Gallilee\n\nMark Gallilee, lead mechanical engineer at ALMA Observatory in San Pedro de Atacama, Chile, moved to Santiago with his family in March 2018. However, after failing to settle, the family moved back to Oxford, UK, in August the same year. Gallilee now commutes between the UK and Chile.\n\nWhen we moved to Santiago, it was a rush to find an apartment before I started work. Unfortunately, we chose the wrong location.\n\nWe moved to an area called La Dehesa, west of Santiago city and away from the airport. La Dehesa is not typical of Santiago because it houses a large expat community and almost looks like a US suburb. It has good restaurants and expat food (there is an English shop in Espacio Urbano on Rodeo Avenue), and international schools, such as Nido de Aguilas.\n\nNido de Aguilas is among the city\u2019s range of international schools\n\nHowever, the city\u2019s pollution is bad in winter especially, and La Dehesa is no exception, despite its higher altitude compared with the rest of the city. My wife suffers from asthma and the pollution made this unbearable.\n\nShe also had bad luck with car accidents, and my son had to go to hospital for stitches after an accident at the beach. It was all too much for them. Luckily, direct flights from Santiago to London make commuting to the UK feasible.\n\nSantiago is much cheaper than London for a comparable standard of living, and the weather is much better than most places in Europe. However, Chile is expensive in South American terms. Renting a two- or three-bedroom family apartment in the capital costs between 500,000 and 1m pesos ($750-$1,500) a month, depending on the area.\n\nSome central neighbourhoods, such as Providencia, are cheaper, easily accessible on the metro and offer a metropolitan lifestyle with caf\u00e9s and bars. But, as in all big cities, you need to be careful when walking at night, especially alone.\n\nParque Bicentenario in Vitacura, an area popular with expats\n\nExpect rents to be higher in La Dehesa, Vitacura or Las Condes \u2014 areas popular with expats because of the high-end lifestyle they offer. Security tends to be tighter in these districts and all three have good international schools, upmarket shopping centres, such as the Nueva Costanera in Vitacura, and nice caf\u00e9s and restaurants. Las Condes has better public transport because it has more metro stops, whereas in Vitacura, and especially La Dehesa, it is better to own a car.\n\nSantiago\u2019s weather is much better than many places in Europe\n\nYou have not tasted avocado until you have done so in Chile \u2014 it is perfectly ripe. Typically, Chileans order avocado, or palta, on toast, and there is no need to pollute this perfect fruit with anything other than salt and pepper for flavour.\n\nAs for other food, Uncle Fletch, a gourmet burger and craft beer restaurant in La Dehesa, is set in an old train carriage, which adds to its ambience. Try the Sleeping Beauty burger and be prepared for the surprise \u2014 and to share it with another person.\n\nLOBO Brasserie, well known for its beautifully prepared French cuisine, is perfect for a relaxing weekend morning. I recommend the prosecco brunch: a choice of French pastries, fresh fruit, juice and unlimited prosecco, all for less than \u00a320.\n\nRe\u00f1aca beach feels almost Californian with its leisure and eating options\n\nRe\u00f1aca, a small seaside town 90 minutes\u2019 drive north-west of Santiago, is a lovely place for a break from the city. I have only discovered it since my family left for the UK \u2014 I wish we had visited it while they were here. It has a boardwalk and beach, with exercise equipment for the energetic, and caf\u00e9s serving excellent seafood. Try the locos (Chilean abalone) with a pisco sour (a cocktail). This beach would not look out of place in the sunny climes of California.\n\nAnother beach resort, to the north of Re\u00f1aca, is Papudo, with restaurants along the beachfront offering freshly caught seafood.\n\nThe beach at Papudo is popular with all kinds of visitors\n\nAway from the beach, Chile offers a wealth of adventures, such as mountain climbing in the Andes, where 6,000m peaks are common, exploring glaciers in the south and hiking across deserts in the north. Star-gazing in the Atacama desert is an unmissable experience \u2014 the clear, dry climate allows a view of the Milky Way to be found in few other places on Earth.\n\nVicu\u00f1a, ancestors of the alpaca, roam wild in the Atacama desert\n\nMy experience has been that it is difficult to break into groups of friends outside work. I recommend joining local groups and persevering. Also, do not be so European about arrival times: people here work to \u201cChilean time\u201d, which can mean being 10-15 minutes late. Relax, throw out your perceptions and it will be much easier to integrate.\n\nIf we were to do the move again, I would travel around for a few months beforehand with the family to take a good look at the different areas. Take your time before settling and, most of all, enjoy the adventure.\n\nA plateau at 5,000m in the Atacama desert\n\nWhat do you wish you had known before you moved?\n\nTo be patient \u2014 everything takes longer than you expect. Also, there are nice places to live outside Santiago: consider beach resorts such as Vi\u00f1a del Mar and Re\u00f1aca, which has a British school. Both towns are about 90 minutes\u2019 drive from central Santiago \u2014 which would be a long daily commute, but the low pollution and relaxed lifestyle would make it worth it.\n\nIf you would like to be considered for this series please complete our short survey.\n\nPhotographs: Mark Gallilee; Dreamstime; Nido de Aguilas school"

  ],
  "text": "Every year tens of thousands of foreign workers arrive in the US on what are known as H-1B visas. These are visas for people with particular specialist skills to come for just a few years. And they're particularly heavily used by the technology industry to recruit for jobs such as software developers.\n\nSome people think that these companies are abusing the system. That they're really using it to hire cheap foreign labour at the expense of American workers. They say, however, that American workers simply don't have the skills they need. By far the biggest recipient country of H-1B visas is India.\n\nSo it's no surprise that when the Indian IT industry was here in Washington a couple of weeks ago, this issue was top of their agenda. They argue that Indian companies are being unfairly discriminated against when it comes to approvals as opposed to their American rivals. They say it is much easier for Microsoft, for example, to hire an Indian worker in the US than it is for a company such as Infosys.\n\nHowever, while their message is clear, they're finding it much harder to get a straight answer out of the White House about what the president wants. In his two years in office, Donald Trump has made it more complex in a number of ways to get an H-1B visa under his policy of hire American, buy American. But then earlier this year he unexpectedly tweeted that he wanted to enact reforms that would simplify the system, and even give H-1B holders a path to citizenship. Those reforms are still to see the light of day, and most people in the industry that I talk to still don't know whether the president really wants to make this system more or less attractive."

  "authors": [

  ],
  "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nVlad Kramnik, world champion from 2000 to 2007, has retired from competitive play at the early age of 45, citing diminished motivation. Nearly 20 years ago he stunned the chess community when he captured the crown from his fellow Russian, the legendary Garry Kasparov.\n\nThat London series will be remembered for Kramnik\u2019s highly successful use of the Berlin Wall 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 Nf6 with the main line 4 0-0 Nxe4 5 d4 Nd6 6 Bxc6 dxc6 7 dxe5 Nf5 8 Qxd8+ Kxd8. Kasparov failed to refute it, as have many master games since, while recently, as Kramnik mentioned with pleasure in an interview, it was the main defence used by the innovatory program AlphaZero in its match with Stockfish.\n\nKramnik\u2019s niche in chess history is secure, and it could have been still higher but for his results in his best years being marred by a rare form of arthritis.\n\nHis decision reflects the trend for chess strength to decline after age 40, as modern computer-based preparation demands a young memory. It could put extra pressure on Michael Adams. The Cornishman, 47, is being challenged for his England No1 ranking by David Howell, his junior by nearly two decades.\n\n2308\n\nJiri Kociscak v Marcin Tazbir, Czech Republic 2018. White (to move) is a pawn down, and the obvious 1 Bh6, threatening 2 Rxf8 mate, is well met by 1\u2026Rc8. Can you find White\u2019s hidden win?\n\nClick here for solution"

  "title": "Once \u2018poor but sexy\u2019 Berlin bounces back as start-up hub",

  "text": "When a former mayor of Berlin described the city in 2003 as \u201cpoor but sexy\u201d, he was at least half right. Decades of division had left the German capital with high unemployment, a moribund housing market, budget shortfalls and an anaemic business sector.\n\nToday, the picture could not be more different. Berlin\u2019s housing market has recovered. The budget is in surplus, allowing the city\u2019s government to plough funding into schools and infrastructure. The private sector is rich in ideas, jobs and growth capital. Berlin has re-emerged as a business hub.\n\nThis is reflected in this year\u2019s FT 1000 list of the fastest growing businesses in Europe, 24 of which are based in the German capital \u2014 up from 20 last year. Only London, Paris and Milan have a greater share of FT 1000 companies.\n\nBerlin attracted \u20ac3bn in start-up funding last year, according to data from consultancy EY \u2014 more than any other European city apart from London. It makes up almost 60 per cent of funding for new German companies.\n\nIronically, one of the causes of the capital\u2019s upswing lies in the fact that it was \u2014 at least in commercial terms \u2014 a backwater for so long: entrepreneurs found a city with low rents, ample office space and a large pool of talented graduates. The capital became a good place to work because it was a good place to live.\n\nThat, in any case, was the conclusion drawn by Alexander and Natacha Neumann, who launched food company Erdb\u00e4r in Berlin nine years ago. Both were working in the marketing departments of multinational companies before they had the idea of launching a line of healthy, organic children\u2019s snacks branded Freche Freunde, meaning \u201cnaughty friends\u201d.\n\nThe decision to start out in Berlin reflected above all the couple\u2019s personal preference: \u201cWe looked at a few cities in Germany but were drawn to Berlin because of the international and creative environment,\u201d says Mr Neumann. \u201cIn terms of the logistics and proximity to customers it did not make much sense. But we never regretted it.\u201d\n\nErdb\u00e4r ranks 402nd on the FT 1000 list, having grown its annual sales from \u20ac5.2m in 2014 to \u20ac26.4m in 2017. It has 84 employees, most based at the company\u2019s headquarters in the Prenzlauer Berg district. One advantage of Berlin, says Mr Neumann, is the proximity of like-minded founders: \u201cThe start-up network here is fantastic \u2014 you can take away learnings very quickly.\u201d\n\nWe were drawn to Berlin because of the international and creative environment\n\nAnother Berlin-based FT 1000 company is Autodoc, an ecommerce platform for car parts. Founded in 2008, its revenues surged from \u20ac37m in 2014 to \u20ac254m in 2017. Co-founder Alexej Erdle says the company was the result of a simple insight: \u201cOne of our partners was asked to pay \u20ac60 for a car lightbulb. But we knew that you could sell that same part for just \u20ac5 and still make a profit. That was the original idea behind Autodoc.\u201d\n\nBerlin was an obvious home. Autodoc\u2019s founders lived there and it had a large pool of potential staff. Finding qualified workers has become harder but Mr Erdle\u2019s optimism is undimmed. \u201cOur goal is to raise revenues to more than \u20ac1bn. That is ambitious but realistic.\u201d\n\nBerlin-based FT 1000 companies with a higher profile include HelloFresh, the meal-kit start-up which topped the list in 2017, and food business Delivery Hero. Both floated on the stock market in 2017, and have respective market values of about \u20ac1.5bn and \u20ac6.7bn.\n\nAlong with Zalando, the online fashion retailer, Hello Fresh and Delivery Hero enjoyed backing from Rocket Internet, the technology investor that plays an outsized role in the city\u2019s start-up scene.\n\nAnalysts say Berlin\u2019s early focus on ecommerce has given way to a much broader field. \u201cBerlin continues to be a bastion for the ecommerce and fintech sectors. But you now see a lot of activity also in areas such as artificial intelligence and blockchain technology,\u201d says Peter Lennartz, a Berlin-based partner at EY. \u201cAround half of all AI start-ups in Germany are based here.\u201d\n\nWhether Berlin is sexy or not remains a question of taste. But one thing is clear to local experts like Mr Lennartz: \u201cWe are no longer poor.\u201d"

  "text": "A shop is no longer a shop. Or at least the traditional idea of one \u2014 a static space with large plate glass windows, a checkout and shelves of shiny products \u2014 is on the wane as big-name retailers try creative ways to get consumers through the door.\n\nApple stores offer coffee, Patagonia hosts yoga classes and Nike lets you try trainers out on their in-store basketball court. As Roelant Prins, chief commercial officer at global payment company Adyen, put it in a recent sector report: \u201cIn a world where anything can be a shop, and a shop can be anything, how do you evolve to serve today\u2019s shoppers?\u201d\n\nIf this year\u2019s FT 1000 ranking of Europe\u2019s fastest growing companies is anything to go by, the answer lies online, or with a calibrated mix of web and bricks-and-mortar sales.\n\nDespite concerns about consumer spending, the number of companies in the list defining their business as either ecommerce or retail was remarkably consistent at 114, compared with 113 last year. Tellingly, perhaps, slightly more of these plumped for being described specifically as ecommerce rather than retail ventures. Taken together, they were second only in number to technology and services.\n\nNearly all had an online operation, with popular products including clothes, ecigarettes, health and cosmetics. The biggest FT 1000 retailer by revenue is online fast-fashion retailer Boohoo. Adam Tomlinson, a retail sector analyst at Liberum, says the key to Boohoo\u2019s success is speed and focus on one niche of customer \u2014 16-to-30-year-olds.\n\n\u201cThey source close to home, which gives them quick lead times,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can pick up on a trend and have a product on their website in two to four weeks, rather than the traditional retail model where you buy six to 12 months in advance and get stuck with loads of stock.\u201d\n\nWebsites can also be a \u201ccapital-light\u201d way to test a market before opening a physical store, says Mr Tomlinson. But expanding turnover quickly is not without hazard. \u201cYou need to manage growth. When you\u2019re growing that fast, risks can be exacerbated. You need to get your suppliers to grow with you.\u201d\n\nThe fastest growing retailer on the FT 1000 list this year was Tantal, an organic cosmetics ecommerce company based in Leonberg in southern Germany. The business, which has tapped into the vegan and wellness trends via its Talea brand, enjoyed a compound annual growth rate in revenues of 220 per cent between 2014 and 2017. In that time, it also opened its first physical shop in Stuttgart.\n\n\u201cThe organic cosmetics market is growing fast,\u201d says Jessica Aldinger, manager and member of the retailer\u2019s founding family. \u201cPeople have become aware of what they are treating their skin, face and bodies with.\u201d Organic cosmetics ban things like aluminium from antiperspirants.\n\nAnother popular consumer trend which has held onto a physical presence is ecigarettes. Experts in the sector see physical retail outlets as presenting those new to vaping with a chance to learn about the product.\n\nFrance\u2019s Le Petit Vapoteur has taken advantage of this. The business started in the small guest room of two ex-smokers, Olivier Dr\u00e9an and Tanguy Gr\u00e9ard, in 2012 and now receives around 5,000 orders a day. The first shop opened in Cherbourg in 2013. Today there are 12 vape shops and a warehouse for its web operation.\n\nClaire Brault, the company\u2019s communications director, attributes its revenue growth to the advice it gives its customers, and the \u201cvintage . . . pin-up look\u201d of its website, styled on early 20th-century advertising posters.\n\nSocial media is an important engagement channel. To the more than 8,000 followers of its Instagram account, the company posts pictures and slow-motion videos of chic French twenty-somethings puffing on ecigarettes.\n\nI don\u2019t think we suspected the move away from the high street would be quite as stark as it has been\n\nThe maturing ecommerce market has meant the execution of online shoppers\u2019 orders is a vibrant subsector where service is key. James Hyde, co-founder of James and James \u2014 an order fulfilment business that made this year\u2019s FT 1000 list \u2014 realised this in 2010.\n\nHe and his partner James Strachan were working at small, family retailer when one day all its orders were mistakenly printed twice, resulting in a double delivery of products. \u201cIt was a bad system. And not the service you\u2019d expect as a customer,\u201d he says.\n\nThe pair decided to build their own order fulfilment system based on cloud computing, the advantage being that a retailer\u2019s inventory is updated instantly and errors are minimised. Companies that have integrated with the James and James system have cut time spent processing orders by up to three-quarters, he says, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t think we suspected the move away from the high street would be quite as stark as it has been.\u201d"

  "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nAmid talk of trade wars, Brexit fallout and an economic slowdown, there is one encouraging business counterpoint: the fastest growing companies in Europe continue to thrive.\n\nToday, the FT publishes its third annual ranking of Europe\u2019s fastest growing companies \u2014 judged by their revenue growth rate between 2014 and 2017. The FT 1000 list is compiled with Statista, a research company.\n\nMany entries are start-ups developing technology to disrupt established industries from financial services to healthcare. This year\u2019s list suggests they are forging ahead. The lowest ranked company to make the list had a compound annual growth rate in revenue of 37.7 per cent, up from 34.6 per cent last year.\n\nToby Coppel, partner at Mosaic Ventures, a London-based venture capital firm, says there has never been a better time to build a start-up.\n\n\u201cThe European start-up ecosystem continues to mature,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are many more successful companies like Spotify where the next generation of founders are trained and then leave to start-up the next company, often with former colleagues [to start something new].\u201d\n\nA decade ago, entrepreneurs would have felt the need to go to San Francisco to grow, says Ophelia Brown, founder of Blossom Capital. But that is no longer the case, she argues, as the success of previous start-ups is encouraging new generations in cities across Europe. \u201cFounders are more ambitious than ever before.\u201d\n\nThe top two companies in the list reflect the region\u2019s established strengths in fintech and consumer services \u2014 Blue Motor Finance, a car finance group, followed by food delivery operator Deliveroo. But this year\u2019s FT 1000 also shows emerging areas of growth. The top 10 includes cancer gene therapy specialist PsiOxus and cyber defence company Darktrace. The latter\u2019s tech has helped companies detect everything from hacks to secret bitcoin mining, co-founder Poppy Gustafsson told the FT last year.\n\nNot to mention drones: the full list includes distributors of the unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as MC2 Technologies, a France-based manufacturer of devices that can jam their signals.\n\nEuropean cities are achieving maturity as start-up hubs after a decade trailing rivals in the US, with a growing number of so-called \u201cunicorn\u201d businesses worth more than $1bn. Brent Hoberman, British entrepreneur and executive chairman of the global Founders Forum, counts 36 new unicorns in Europe and Israel last year, underlining the vibrancy of these regions.\n\nSaul Klein, co-founder of venture fund LocalGlobe, says the UK has led the way in the fashion and retail industries \u2014 Boohoo is among the largest companies by revenue on this list \u2014 as well as financial services, where companies such as TransferWise, Atom and Monzo are breaking into the mainstream.\n\nHowever, the number of companies from the UK and Ireland in the FT 1000 has dropped over the course of its three years, and Brexit is prompting companies to seek licences and open offices elsewhere in Europe to offset the risk of a disruptive no-deal departure from the EU.\n\n\u201cThe Brexit impact will be people,\u201d says Philippe Botteri, of venture capital fund Accel, pointing to the need to hire the region\u2019s best programmers and designers. \u201cCan start-ups still attract talent from continental Europe?\u201d\n\nMr Hoberman agrees that London\u2019s position cannot be taken for granted given an \u201carms race for talent across Europe\u201d.\n\nOthers are bullish about the future after Brexit. Mr Klein expects access to funds to increase, pointing to UK government plans to encourage growth. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had it so good. After the Bay Area [of San Francisco] and China, London is the greatest producer of billion-dollar companies on the planet.\u201d\n\nThis year, cities such as Milan and Berlin have increased their representation on the list. Germany remains the top country base, with two of its start-ups \u2014 Delivery Hero and Hello-Fresh \u2014 in the top three by revenue size.\n\nThe challenge for many groups is to become pan-European in scale. This is a shift that would be helped, experts say, if European regulators formed a coherent plan around a digital single market. A next step was taken in February with a proposed modernisation of copyright rules.\n\nBut there are still concerns over the so-called \u201ctechlash\u201d by regulators seeking greater oversight and control over technology companies that are being criticised for their handling of personal data. Mr Coppel says that \u201crules are going to change and start-ups need to get ahead of that\u201d. Privacy may become a feature to trumpet rather than a problem, he adds.\n\nOscar Berglund, chief executive of Swedish fintech Trustly, at rank 482, also worries about where regulation is heading, particularly for financial services. But securing funding is not currently a problem for companies, he says, with more potential partners than five or 10 years ago eager to invest and based in Europe.\n\nIn fact, after a year in which many publicly listed companies began to flag concerns \u2014 from the slowdown in retail to the threat of UK\u2019s planned departure from the EU \u2014 founders and funders alike say that capital for growth has never been easier to find. The pool of venture capital funds has meant groups can stay private for longer, rather than risk the greater scrutiny of the public markets.\n\nEvidence of an economic slowdown in some countries in Europe has yet to visibly affect the FT 1000. The disrupters on the list are better protected. Mr Botteri argues that such companies will thrive even if economic conditions deteriorate, given that many are set up to take market share from incumbent businesses. \u201cThey are disrupting existing businesses.\u201d\n\nMr Hoberman points to the growing use of big data in fintech and healthcare, and he expects new efforts bringing together robotics and food delivery. Mr Klein thinks the next wave of innovation will come in AI and quantum computing.\n\nMr Coppel flags continued innovation in mobility and location services \u2014 \u201csoftware is \u2018eating\u2019 cars, trucks, scooters and drones, enabling smarter, autonomous applications that will rewire cities\u201d, he says. He also points to the opportunities to use big data and machine learning to discover new drugs and treat complex diseases."

  "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nIn the 57th minute of a match that took place last November, striker Kike Garcia passed the ball into an empty net. The goal sealed SD Eibar\u2019s first victory over Real Madrid in the team\u2019s 79-year history.\n\nReal is the world\u2019s highest-earning football club, achieving revenues of \u20ac751m last season following its third consecutive victory in Europe\u2019s elite competition, the Champions League.\n\nEibar, by contrast, is one of the smallest clubs in La Liga, playing in only its fifth season in Spain\u2019s top division. The team represents a small town of just 27,000 inhabitants in the Basque country. That number would not fill even half of Real\u2019s Bernab\u00e9u stadium.\n\nEibar had revenues of just \u20ac58.7m in 2016-17. But that equated to a three-year compound annual growth rate of 44.1 per cent \u2014 which was enough to join the FT 1000 list of Europe\u2019s fastest growing companies for a second year in a row.\n\nIts rise has been down to a mixture of luck and judicious financial planning. \u201cWe have operated like a small town company, like a family,\u201d says Jon Ander Ulazia, Eibar\u2019s chief executive, who calls this conservative approach part of a \u201cculture of our grandmas\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of years in Spain, small clubs have been spending a lot of money and they have great debts that have made them unsustainable,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have been in a good situation, we have no debt, due to our culture. This has allowed us to be more competitive behind the great clubs.\u201d\n\nSix years ago, Eibar was playing in Spanish football\u2019s third tier. Unexpectedly, it won back-to-back promotions. The march up the divisions led to La Liga, but there was a catch. Due to laws designed to strengthen clubs to ensure they had enough capital to operate, Eibar was told to raise \u20ac1.7m to ensure promotion.\n\nThe club launched a scheme allowing supporters to buy voting shares in return for small sums. The plan received support of senior football figures such as Xabi Alonso, the former Real Madrid midfielder who once played briefly for Eibar.\n\nReports from the time suggest that 10,000 people from 50 countries bought in. That allowed Eibar to raise the required figure, while also putting the club in the ownership of its fans.\n\nWe have to be a different club that again aspires to play in La Liga, instead of trying not to be relegated\n\nUp against wealthier rivals in the top division, the club struggled and finished in 18th place during the 2014-15 season \u2014 a position that should have seen them relegated. But rival Elche was demoted from La Liga instead as punishment for financial mismanagement, leading to Eibar retaining its place in the league.\n\n\u201cI always found that poetic in a way, as Eibar has always been labelled as one of the best-run clubs,\u201d says Euan McTear, author of the 2015 book Eibar the Brave: The Extraordinary Rise of La Liga\u2019s Smallest Team.\n\n\u201cThey got that reprieve because Elche was very poorly run. That\u2019s the luck they\u2019ve had along the way.\u201d\n\nEibar\u2019s timing was doubly lucky. In 2016, La Liga began to negotiate television broadcast deals collectively among its member clubs, distributing funds more equally.\n\nBefore this, clubs would negotiate TV contracts individually, which benefited big teams like Real Madrid and Barcelona.\n\n\u201cWhat it meant is that they are guaranteed a relatively high amount of revenues,\u201d says Tim Bridge, a director at Deloitte\u2019s sports business group. \u201cIt is a testament to the whole centralisation model that a club like Eibar can now succeed.\u201d\n\nStill, Eibar has stayed in La Liga without spending beyond its means. It generated pre-tax profits of \u20ac14m in 2016-17. The team relies on promoting young players and scouting footballers acquired cheaply before they move on to other clubs that can offer higher salaries. For example, defender Florian Lejeune joined the English Premier League\u2019s Newcastle United for \u00a39m in June 2017, a season after Eibar acquired him for \u00a31.35m, according to data from Transfermarkt, a football statistics site.\n\nEibar\u2019s executives accept a club of its size could be relegated from La Liga in the future. Instead of big spending on players to avoid this fate, it is using about \u20ac40m from its recent windfall to improve and expand its stadium, and build new training and academy facilities. These are intended to strengthen Eibar over the long term.\n\n\u201cWhat we have done with these investments is transform our club,\u201d says Mr Ander Ulazia. \u201cWe have to become a strong club. We have to be a different club that again aspires to play in La Liga, instead of trying not to be relegated again to the third tier.\u201d"

  "text": "The county of Kent, commonly called the garden of England, is not the most obvious spot to find a fast growing finance company. Bob Jones, who has worked in the sector for almost 50 years and now leads Blue Motor Finance, does not look like a stereotypical fintech executive.\n\nBut when Mr Jones is asked how his enterprise \u2014 which launched five years ago within an existing licensed business \u2014 has grown so quickly, his explanation could be taken right out of the fintech textbook. \u201cThe banks provide a fantastic service in the marketplace, we just do it better because they\u2019re not as agile as we are,\u201d he explains in Blue Motor\u2019s headquarters outside Sevenoaks.\n\nChris Jones, Bob\u2019s son and Blue\u2019s chief operating officer, says that the \u201c\u00a3100bn-plus\u201d motor finance market has been \u201cdominated by the banks for a long time\u201d. He adds: \u201cWe\u2019ve basically used tech to make the process better, faster and smarter, removing friction from the process . . . you can walk into a dealership and at the fastest level you can walk out with a car 20 minutes later.\u201d\n\nBehind Blue\u2019s dealer-facing app lies sophisticated analytics to make speedy and risk-graded loans. This tech helped drive it to the top of the annual FT 1000 list of Europe\u2019s fastest growing companies, up from 21st last year. Revenues hit \u00a352.3m in 2017, from just \u00a3102,000 in 2014.\n\nTarun Sharma, a partner at Blue\u2019s private equity owner Cabot Square \u2014 management also holds a small stake \u2014 says the company has performed \u201csignificantly better than our expectations\u201d since it invested \u00a337.5m in the venture in 2014. Now, Cabot and Blue are in discussions with investment bankers about a potential sale which could see the business taken over by a larger private equity group or established lender.\n\nA buyer might question the health prospects of such a fast-growing loan book. Blue\u2019s expansion has coincided with a growth period for consumer lending businesses, with low interest rates helping push default levels to historic lows. But the economic outlook has grown more uncertain, with banks expecting a rise in defaults.\n\nMr Sharma insists Cabot is not looking to cash in before the going gets rough. \u201c[The sale is] driven by Blue\u2019s maturity and available options \u2014 they have grown significantly, but they\u2019re just scratching the surface in terms of related or adjacent areas they could be involved in, and for the next leg of growth they need significantly more capital,\u201d he says.\n\nBlue has lent around \u00a31bn since 2014 and expects to increase that figure by 50 per cent this year alone.\n\nLast year, it completed its first securitisation of its motor finance contracts, which analysts at Moody\u2019s cautioned was higher risk than a typical UK auto deal. However, Blue said investor demand was high, which it saw as a \u201cbig vote of confidence\u201d.\n\nCar purchases have been a key factor in household debt levels reaching new highs, leading some to question their sustainability. Bob Jones argues the car financing market should be resilient in a downturn, as customers\u2019 reliance on their cars makes them particularly reluctant to risk losing the vehicle by defaulting.\n\nMuch of the recent growth in the market has been driven by the personal contract purchase, a form of leasing where drivers rarely take actual ownership of the vehicle but instead finance its depreciation for several years before trading it in. This exposes lenders to risks if cars do not hold their value as well as predicted.\n\nFinance is used for 91 per cent of new car purchases, the bulk of which is now via PCP. Blue has focused instead on traditional loans for used cars and has avoided PCP. \u201c[It\u2019s] the frothy bit of the market. We\u2019ve been under pressure to do it but we\u2019ve always held the line and said we just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a clever idea,\u201d Chris Jones adds.\n\nBlue is looking to expand into lending directly to dealerships to fund their stock purchases. Mr Sharma suggests that a future owner could also use Blue\u2019s technology to grow in areas beyond motor finance.\n\nDespite its revenue and profit growth \u2014 with pre-tax profits of \u00a37m in 2017 \u2014 Blue has not yet attracted the eye-watering valuations of some fintechs. Bob Jones jokes that he is \u201cin jealous awe\u201d of start-ups such as peer-to-peer lender Funding Circle, which has a market value of \u00a31.4bn despite not turning a profit. Any sale is not expected to value Blue above the $1bn mark to qualify as a \u201cunicorn\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve achieved in terms of the growth so far is itself spectacular \u2014 we just don\u2019t see why that would diminish,\u201d says Bob Jones. Having lent its first billion pounds, he thinks Blue could get to that level in annual lending \u201calmost automatically\u201d."

  "title": "Five reasons to live in Colombo, Sri Lanka",
  "authors": [],
  "text": "By Jo Caird\n\nAs Sri Lanka\u2019s capital recovers from decades of civil war that ended in 2009, rising investment makes this eclectic metropolis increasingly attractive.\n\nA changing skyline\n\nColombo is changing fast, thanks to infrastructure projects, funded largely by Chinese investment. Luxury high-rise hotels and apartments are popping up along Galle Face Green, the city\u2019s seaside promenade, and Port City Colombo, a massive land reclamation scheme inspired by Dubai, will expand the central business district and eventually dwarf the historic Fort neighbourhood.\n\nHigh-rises are popping up along Galle Face Green\n\nMeanwhile Sri Lanka\u2019s government is courting more and more diverse foreign investment to grow its export base, currently dominated by tea and textiles. The Asian Development Bank predicts 4.5 per cent growth in gross domestic product in 2019 and says the Indian Ocean nation could become an \u201cupper middle-income country\u201d in the next \u201cfew years\u201d.\n\nPort City Colombo under construction, inspired by similar developments in Dubai\n\nA convenient location\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s location has attracted international business since the days of the ancient maritime silk route, when ships laden with Chinese and Roman goods stopped at the island\u2019s busy ports. Today, business people can take advantage of frequent direct flights between Colombo and Dubai (five hours), London (11 hours) and Beijing (seven hours). The airport lies 33km from the city centre.\n\nColombo\u2019s history of commerce stretches back thousands of years\n\nDiverse architecture\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s status as a trading stop led to it being colonised by Europeans, starting with Portugal in the 16th century. Barely any evidence of Portuguese occupation remains in Colombo, though examples of later Dutch and British architecture abound, from the 17th-century Old Dutch Hospital \u2014 now an upmarket shopping and dining precinct \u2014 to the red-fronted Cargills department store, built in 1906.\n\nThe early 20th-century Cargills department store building\n\nHigh-quality education\n\nThe city has several highly regarded international schools. Elizabeth Moir School and Colombo International School follow the UK curriculum and have high teacher to student ratios. The International Schools of Sri Lanka membership body is a good starting point for parents looking for places for their children.\n\nBeautiful beaches\n\nColombo has a warm climate all year round and is close to seemingly endless stretches of beautiful sand on the west and south coasts. A couple of hours\u2019 drive on the Southern Expressway will take you to the boutique hotels of Bentota and top surfing spots such as Unawatuna.\n\nUnawatuna, a favourite destination for surfers\n\nPhotographs: Getty Images/iStockphoto; Alamy; Dreamstime"

  "text": "So after a long look. After a long investigation. After so many people have been so badly hurt. After not looking at the other side, where a lot of bad things happened, a lot of horrible things happened. A lot of very bad things happened for our country. It was just announced there was no collusion with Russia. The most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. There was no collusion with Russia. There was no obstruction, and none whatsoever.\n\nAnd it was a complete and total exoneration. It's a shame that our country had to go through this. To be honest, it's a shame that your president has had to go through this for... before I even got elected, it began.\n\nAnd it began illegally. And hopefully, somebody is going to look at the other side. This was an illegal take down that failed. And hopefully, somebody is going to be looking at the other side. So it's complete exoneration. No collusion, no obstruction. Thank you very much. Thank you.\n\nMr President, do you think the report's going to be made public?"

  "text": "Here are just some of the stories we'll be watching this week. UK Prime Minister Theresa May battles to save her Brexit deal. Ukrainians go to the polls to choose their next leader. Tunisia will host this year's Arab League summit. And there will be first-quarter results from H&M.\n\nFirst up, UK Prime Minister Theresa May is set to put her Brexit deal to a third parliamentary vote early this week after EU leaders agreed to delay the UK's departure from the bloc, from March 29 until at least April 12. The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, has warned he could block a vote, unless the deal is substantially different to the version that was rejected two weeks ago. If the vote is blocked or if the deal is rejected for a third time, MPs are likely to take control of the parliamentary agenda to debate alternatives to Mrs May's plan.\n\nIf MPs reject it, we're really in very uncertain territory. We would expect the UK to seek a longer extension, perhaps to have a broader political process around finding a Brexit solution. But Theresa May said that she wouldn't lead that... she wouldn't accept that as prime minister. So would she be overthrown? Would there be a Tory leadership contest or an interim prime minister?\n\nAnd would there be an EU summit later in the week to discuss any requests for a longer extension? So really instead of what we were expecting two years ago, which was a triumphant exit with a smooth pathway out to the EU, we're very, very uncertain and in a place that even people here in Westminster didn't expect us to be six months ago.\n\nNow to Ukraine, where presidential elections will take place on Sunday. This is the second presidential vote since pro-European demonstrators ousted pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014. Weeks later, Russian forces annexed the Crimean peninsula and the Russian backed separatists seized power in the eastern Donbas region of the country.\n\nThe conflict between the rebels and Ukrainian forces has cost the lives of more than 10,000 people so far. The country has not fallen apart under relentless pressure from Moscow, however, and the Ukrainian economy has actually stabilised in recent years. But the election result is unpredictable, not least because Ukrainians appear fed up with their current president Petro Poroshenko and his inability to root out corruption.\n\nThere is Yulia Tymoshenko, twice former prime minister, who is campaigning on an overtly sort of populist stance. But she was leading convincingly in the polls, but has slipped now and it seems to be losing momentum. The great surprise of the campaign is the fact that Vladimir Zelinsky, a comedian who is best known in Ukraine for playing the role of a teacher who becomes president, has surged into the lead and is surfing on popular discontent with all of the established Ukrainian politicians, who to many people represent cronyism and corruption in public life.\n\nTunis is set to host this year's Arab League Summit on Sunday. Tunisia's foreign minister recently called on the organisation to readmit Syria to its ranks. The league suspended Syria's membership in 2011 after government forces were used to brutally put down those opposed to President Bashar al-Assad. Eight years on, President Assad has effectively taken back control of most of the country with help from Iran and Russia. Now, Arab leaders, many of whom backed Syrian rebels during the conflict, are considering whether to invite Assad back to the table in order to counter Iranian and Turkish influence in Syria.\n\nThere is kind of regional power struggle been going on for years now with Arab powers trying to push back against Iran's influence in the Arab world. And Syria is one place where the Iranian roles become more embedded, particularly as a result of the conflict because Iran sent in troops to support the Assad regime, it supported foreign proxies, militias like Hezbollah, the Lebanese movement. So whilst the Arabs backed the opposition, which is pretty much been crushed, the Iranians have strengthened their alliance with the Assad regime.\n\nAnd finally, Sweden's H&M will release its first-quarter results on Friday. The world's second largest retailer disappointed investors at the end of 2018 when pre-tax profits for the fourth quarter fell 11 per cent compared with the same period a year earlier. The family controlled group blamed costs from replacing logistics systems at the time. They also cited actions taken to transform the company in the face of competition from online retailers.\n\nH&M has been on a miserable run of recent. Both its sales and its profits have been falling as it faces ever tougher competition from online sellers. And what it's been doing, is like in the store in Oslo behind me, renovating them, freshening them up, hoping to attract customers back again. And that's what investors are going to be looking out for.\n\nThey're going to be wanting to see if there are any signs that H&M's margins, which have been long under that there's some recovery there. And they'll also be hoping that the early signs of this year, in terms of sales, are positive. And that's what the week ahead looks like from the Financial Times in London."

  "title": "How capturing CO2 from air can combat climate change",

  "text": "Think about climate change and you may not picture the foothills of the Swiss Alps. But one company here is trying to save the planet one carbon dioxide molecule at a time. Their name is Climeworks. And their business is pulling carbon dioxide out of the air.\n\nSo Louise, tell me what is happening here at this facility around us.\n\nSure, what we have behind us is a Climeworks direct air capture plant. Here, we have 18 CO2 collectors. They draw ambient air through in this direction. And the CO2 molecules essentially stick to the filter material inside there. And once that filter material is saturated, is full of CO2, then we close the collector, we heat it to about 100 degrees Celsius, and the CO2 then unsticks.\n\nOnce the CO2 unbinds from the material, it can be syphoned off, leaving the filter free to collect more. This plant is able to capture 900 tonnes of CO2 every year. But it takes heat and electricity to work.\n\nAnd where does this facility get the energy that powers this process?\n\nIn this particular set-up, we're using energy from waste. So we've built these plants on the roof of a waste incineration plant. And through the burning of the rubbish, energy is generated and we make use of that energy to power our direct air capture machines.\n\nSome of the CO2 that Climeworks captures is injected underground. The company already has a facility in Iceland, where the CO2 is pumped into basaltic rock and mixed with water to form solid carbonate, effectively turning it into stone. But the core of their business right now is selling the gas to be used again.\n\nThe CO2 that Climeworks is capturing just a few hundred metres away, it is pumped through an underground pipeline directly into this greenhouse. And you can see the black pipes hanging below. That's where the CO2 is released into the greenhouse.\n\nAnd what role does it play when it arrives here?\n\nVegetables, plants, they love CO2. They require it for photosynthesis. And so with higher concentrations of CO2 within the greenhouse, the better those plants can grow. This particular greenhouse has seen an increased crop yield of 20 per cent.\n\nThere are only three start-ups in the world that operate direct air capture facilities. And Climeworks was the first to land paying customers. But they're a long way from achieving their ultimate goal, removing 1 per cent of global annual CO2 emissions by 2025. To do that, they'll need customers who want to sequester CO2 rather than just reuse it.\n\nAt present, there is no market for carbon dioxide removal. So the real exam question is, how do we generate a market where one doesn't exist right now from a standing start? Until that happens, the capacity for the negative emissions market to develop to the scale that's needed, of gigatonne scale, will be highly problematic.\n\nClimeworks believes there's a huge potential market for captured CO2 if they can drive down costs to a level that's attractive. Working with new technology and on a small scale means it costs $600 to remove a tonne of carbon dioxide from the air. For them, the challenge is to make their product cheap enough to be rolled out on a large scale.\n\nWhat about the costs? There are critics who say that currently the costs are too high and that it will never be economical enough to really impact climate change.\n\nOur goal as in what we are working towards, which we are very confident also that we can arrive during the next couple of years, is taking a tonne of CO2 out of the air at a cost of around $100 per tonne. And that's what we believe is the same level at which policies will be active, and that will on the very large scale pay for removing CO2 from the earth. So that is then a level where we can scale to the gigatonne level, which is required to have an impact.\n\nScientists estimate that by 2050, we will need to be removing 10bn tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere every year in order to limit the worst effects of global warming. Direct air capture isn't the only way to do this, but it could be one tool among many.\n\nWith today's technology, direct air capture is still uneconomic. And critics say it can never be built on a large enough scale to make a difference to the climate. But at a time of rising emissions and rising global temperatures, more people are coming around to the view that this technology does have a role to play."

  "authors": [
    "Filmed",
    "Edited Joe Sinclair"
  ],
  "text": "No Brexit!\n\nWelcome to Westminster and the heart of British politics. We're on the march to put Brexit back to the British people in a second referendum. Hundreds of thousands of people have turned up.\n\nBut what are the folks on this march actually trying to achieve? Because with just a few weeks to go until the UK is set to leave the EU, there's still not enough support in that place over there, the House of Commons, for MPs to change their mind. So let's go and find out what these people are hoping to achieve.\n\nExcuse me, ladies, sorry to bother you. I'm a journalist from the Financial Times. I just wanted to ask why you've come on the vote today and what you're hoping to achieve?\n\nBecause I want peace, friendship, and co-operation.\n\nWe all want those things. What's that got to do the people's vote?\n\nBecause we get it by belonging to the EU.\n\nAnd how do you think we're actually going to get that referendum, as we're due to leave in a couple of weeks anyway?\n\nWell, we'll get it by people force. And that's why we're out here today.\n\nSo you think you can change the minds of MPs?\n\nWe hope so.\n\nThey've not listened so far.\n\nNo, but they are beginning to consider other options.\n\nI want it for the future of my grandchildren.\n\nWhat do we want?\n\nRevoke!\n\nWhen do we want it?\n\nNow!\n\nNo Brexit!\n\nNo Brexit!\n\nRevoke Article 50!\n\nActually, I'd rather like them to revoke Article 50.\n\nDo you think that's going to happen though?\n\nI'm quietly confident. Quietly confident and optimistic.\n\nEven though MPs...\n\nBecause if not, it's too depressing to contemplate.\n\nTo stop Brexit.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah, simple as that. We don't want Brexit to happen. The whole of the vote was based on lies. Now we know what... we've got better picture. I mean, where do you start, the government's doing a dreadful, dreadful job. Jeremy Corbyn is shit. The people need to have their voices heard. It's as simple as that.\n\nDo you think people knew what they were voting for in 2016?\n\nNo, they didn't. No, they didn't. It was too binary, it was too binary. We didn't know...\n\nBut another vote would be binary as well.\n\nYes, but we know what we're voting for this time. We vote on Theresa May's dreadful idea, or we vote to remain, or we vote for another one.\n\nKeep the Front out!\n\nThe last referendum three years ago is not representative of the views today.\n\nHow so?\n\nBecause it's been a long time. Voters have changed, opinions have changed as the facts have come available. And I think that we need another chance to say what we feel.\n\nWhat do we want?\n\nRevoke!\n\nWhen do we want it!\n\nNow!\n\nHey, hey, hey, Theresa May, we demand a final say!\n\nThe march has stopped in front of Downing Street right here. And as you can see, the protesters are trying to send a message to the prime minister.\n\nWe're really angry at the mess Mrs May's making of this as well. And this is about the last straw.\n\nIt was always going to be difficult, though. You can't necessarily blame her for it all. Do you not think?\n\nNo, no, not entirely her. Her party and the government as well.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut they've made a pretty terrible batch of it.\n\nBut how are you actually going to get that referendum, because we're due to leave in a few weeks.\n\nYep.\n\nWell, hopefully, in parliament in the few days ahead. I mean, we can't go on as we are. It's ridiculous.\n\nI think it's the last avenue left to us to show that everything is broken, and that our parliament is broken, and that we just really need a better way.\n\nHow confident are you of getting that second vote, because we're due to leave in a couple of weeks?\n\nDon't know, but we're here. That's all we can do.\n\nHow are you hoping to persuade the folks over there, who don't seem very willing for a second referendum?\n\nIt's a difficult thing. All we can do is apply public pressure and show that it is not a one-way street. And that people do care about this and people very strongly want to remain. Bollocks to Brexit!\n\nOne of the ironies of Brexit is the UK's never really had a strong Europhile moment. And it has emerged just at the point where we're about to leave the EU. It's clear from the folks that I've spoken to on the people's vote march that they don't quite have a plan to make sure we do have a second referendum. But they want to have their voices heard. The big question for British politics, now, is all this the beginning of something or the end of it?"

  "title": "Brexit: why Theresa May now sees no-deal as second-best option",
  "authors": [],
  "text": "Theresa May sat alone while European leaders decided the timing of Britain's departure from the European Union. Here with me is Robert Shrimsley to explain what looks like a decidedly dicey deal. Robert, when is Britain going to leave?\n\nIt's still very much up in the air, Lionel. The European Union has given Britain two new dates for departure. The first is April the 12th, if Theresa May cannot get her deal through, possibly next week. And the second is May 22, if she does get her deal through. And that's the amount of time it needs to put the mechanics in place.\n\nSo we're still very, very much up in the air. We were hurtling towards the cliff edge a couple of days ago.\n\nThat's crashing out.\n\nYes.\n\nWith no-deal.\n\nYou know, we were eight days from the cliff edge with no-deal looking a serious possibility. No-deal is still definitely an option. But the date has pushed back a little bit.\n\nSo we've got a couple more weeks. But at the moment, of course, this is a very fluid situation. But Mrs May's deal looks, it's against the odds, isn't it, of passage?\n\nIt's very hard to see, as things stand, how she gets this deal through. It's an amazing reversal in the last seven days of her position. Seven days ago, she had a strategy. And the strategy was to squeeze her own Brexit hardliners and say, look, it's running away from us. If you don't vote for my deal, we're going to get a soft Brexit or a delay. And that was beginning to work. They were beginning to crack.\n\nIn the space of a couple of days at the beginning of this week, she has flipped her strategy on its head, if indeed she still has a strategy. She's now appeasing her hardliners and essentially trying to frighten the rest of parliament into backing her deal for fear of a no-deal exit.\n\nAnd should we blame the Speaker, John Bercow, for citing a 1604 precedent, whereby you can't just keep coming back with the same deal for approval in the House of Commons?\n\nI think there were four decisive steps to the way Theresa May turned. And that was one of them.\n\nThe week before, MPs had failed yet again to seize control of the parliamentary timetable. And she looked at them and thought, you guys are never going to get your act together on an alternative deal. The next day, nearly 200 of her own MPs voted against an extension of Article 50.\n\nThen John Bercow's ruling came up, stopped her from putting the meaningful vote again before the European summit. And then finally, her own cabinet turned on her and said, we cannot support a long delay. And the chief whip advised her clearly that the party would be broken if she tried to force through a long delay. And I think Theresa May has essentially changed position. She now believes that a no-deal Brexit is the second best option after her own deal.\n\nSo let's just assume that her deal is voted down, obviously, speculation. Does she then have to resign?\n\nIt's very difficult to see how she can stay on, and indeed, why she would want to. Because she has said she does not want to oversee a long delay. And the only alternative to a long delay, if her deal falls, is no deal. I think she might be prepared to carry that through.\n\nBut what will happen in parliament is that MPs are going to give themselves the chance to vote on alternative options. The staying in the single market, the so-called Norway option, permanent customs union, second referendum, all the other options. If one of those were to get a majority in parliament, and it has to be said, MPs have proved very inept at solidifying...\n\nAnd there isn't a cross-party movement either.\n\nIf one of them were to get a majority, I think, and her policy's been voted down, it's very hard to see how she can stay on or why she would want to.\n\nAnd what happens then? Does the deputy prime minister step in? Or do we have to have a leadership election?\n\nNo. I mean, the Conservatives, unlike the Labour party, don't have an official deputy. So although David Lidington is often referred to as the de facto deputy, it's de facto, not de jure. And the way it works is that she would say she was resigning as prime minister but would stay on as prime minister until such time as the Conservatives choose another leader. So she would be unfettered but also without any power. It would be very, very messy.\n\nThe one thing that could happen, I suppose, is that parliament votes to attach the future direction to her deal. In the political declaration they say, we now want that to say it's Norway, or it's permanent customs union, and then we'll vote through your deal. Or it could say, we'll vote through your deal if we can attach a referendum to it. So at that point, she might think it was worth just staying on a bit longer to take it over the line. But it's very, very messy, very difficult.\n\nAnd finally, the other point is that it's very hard to see how a government not committed to a policy of this importance could then legislate it through. The Tories don't believe in the Norway option, so how could they actually take that through? You could well then be heading for an election.\n\nSo Robert, I'm going to put you on the spot. It's not a football question. Are we likely to have an early election, general election?\n\nI think the odds of an election sometime this year are going up all of the time. Most paths lead to an election. The only one that I think doesn't is if MPs solidify around her deal, which, as we've said, does not look very likely at the moment.\n\nRobert Shrimsley, thank you very much."

  "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nGuest curator: Prof Dame Sally Davies\n\n\n\nI remember sitting in a dark office in 2012 in the UK\u2019s Department of Health working through the complexities of how we could make the 100,000 Genomes Project happen. This week, I had the pleasure of speaking at the celebratory event recognising its success. The UK is the first country in the world to sequence 100,000 genomes. I am very proud of what has been achieved by the researchers, staff and most importantly patients and families.\n\n\n\nHowever, we must not rest on our laurels if we are truly to unlock the potential of the human genome. The power of genomics is available and we need to embed it into the fabric of NHS services, which is the role of our new NHS Genomic Medicine Service.\n\n\n\nAntimicrobial resistance was a big part of my work this week, as always. I am proud of the work of the NHS and of meat producers to reduce antibiotic use, but globally much more needs to be done. I am working hard alongside the World Health Organization to implement the recommendations of the United Nations Interagency Group on AMR, of which I am a co-convener: we need a UN leadership group covering human health, agriculture, animals and the environment to keep up momentum and action across the world.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead for fresh opportunities has always been a strong theme for me. My last annual report explored what health could and should be like in 2040. My final report as chief medical officer will be on global health: last week I convened a workshop to identify some of the key themes, such as how the UK should support global health.\n\n\n\nGlobal health is about security, sustainability and equity. Some communities in England have poor health outcomes that are often hidden by national averages. This is why I believe we need a composite health index to judge our progress, which would look not only at health outcomes but also social determinants and modifiable risk factors such as obesity, exercise and smoking.\n\n\n\nA key aim of my annual reports is to look strategically and make recommendations on how to improve systems and, ultimately, health. So, watch this space but if the global health workshop is anything to go by, it will be fascinating.\n\n\n\nWhat I'm reading\n\nI have just finished Educated by Tara Westover, which is moving on the human level but also demonstrates the power of education to ignite people\u2019s lives.\n\n\n\nI have also just started The Masters by C.P. Snow as a fun preparation for my installation in October as Master of Trinity College, Cambridge. I am listening to a wonderful young composer called Owain Park, who writes ethereal music and I hope will compose a Te Deum for my installation ceremony at Trinity.\n\nThree questions\n\nJon Symonds CBE, HSBC\u2019s deputy group chairman and Genomics England chair\n\n\n\nWhy did you decide to become the chair of Genomics England?\n\nIt took a nanosecond to decide. The introduction of genomic-based medicine is the most ambitious project I have been involved in and the one with the most far-reaching impact. It is also one of the few areas where the UK has the ability legitimately to lead the world in the introduction of personalised medicine at a national scale. It represents the true confluence of biology, physics, computing power and data analytics on a huge scale. We now need to move from a project to an operational organisation in partnership with the NHS as we move from 100,000 genomes to up to 5m through the NHS and with research partners. That is a hugely inspiring and challenging task that is, quite simply, too important not to be achieved.\n\n\n\nWhat are the challenges of getting genomics into the NHS?\n\n\n\nThe introduction of genomic-based medicine in the NHS has the potential to turn the system upside down. Genomics has the power to both predict and anticipate the incidence of chronic illness and debilitating disease, speeding up earlier diagnosis and treatment. This will generate better health outcomes, use more cost-effective therapies and enable the NHS to deliver more for less. We have to proceed in partnership with the NHS and its patients, but the progressive digitisation of health and the power of analytics can transform the provision of health in the UK. If we can do that, the NHS will continue to be the envy of the world.\n\nIn my last annual report, I made the case to reposition health as the nation\u2019s primary asset. As a leader in the finance sector, could you outline how important you think health is to the economy?\n\n\n\nThe \u201chealth of the nation\u201d is the most productive asset we own. It has always puzzled me that healthcare has only ever been characterised as a cost or a percentage burden on GDP. In truth, it\u2019s the biggest single economic investment the UK makes and it\u2019s time that we measured the economic potential released from better health. It\u2019s a triple win \u2013 people living longer with a lower incidence of chronic disease, and being more economically productive later in life while reducing the overall cost of health. That is an economic policy well worth fighting for.\n\nNews round-up\n\nCrackdown on junk food ads as Chief Medical Officer warns of impact of social media promotions (Telegraph). I believe we need to fundamentally reposition health as the nation\u2019s primary asset. Part of this is creating an environment that makes the healthy choice the easy choice.\n\nAnti-vax movement must be resisted for the sake of world health (FT). Vaccines work, they are safe and have saved countless lives. I implore everyone to vaccinate their children to protect them from potentially deadly diseases.\n\nThe relationships between democratic experience, adult health, and cause-specific mortality in 170 countries between 1980 and 2016: an observational analysis (CFR). Demonstrating the association between democracy and health gain.\n\n\n\nThe war on \u2018prediabetes\u2019 could be a boon for pharma \u2014 but is it good medicine? (Science). We have continually to challenge our priors, so this is fascinating.\n\nBest from the journals\n\nBreast Implant-Associated Lymphoma (JAMA). Confirming the association, though rare, between implants and lymphoma\n\nHow secret conversations inside cells are transforming biology (Nature). What is says on the tin\n\n\n\nIntimate Partner Violence (NEJM). Such an important area, which I highlighted in my annual report.\n\n\n\nCardiology\u2019s problem women (Lancet). Opening the debate on gender relating to involvement in research and patient management. For all I know about it, this is still shocking\n\n\n\nAntibiotic and acid-suppression medications during early childhood are associated with obesity. (BMJ Gut). I cannot get this article out of my head\n\n\n\nExposing Anopheles mosquitoes to antimalarials blocks Plasmodium parasite transmission (Nature). So malaria eradication may be possible. A new approach.\n\nSafety and Efficacy of Bempedoic Acid to Reduce LDL Cholesterol.(NEJM). High cholesterol is associated with heart attack and stroke. New treatments and approaches will help. As I have hypercholesterolaemia I follow this science carefully.\n\n\n\nA Longitudinal Study of Ebola Sequelae in Liberia. (NEJM) A sobering read. The world is good at emergency response but this demonstrates the need for following through.\n\nBenefits and harms of spinal manipulative therapy for the treatment of chronic low back pain: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (BMJ). A systematic review (the gold standard for evidence in health) of management of an all too common problem for many of us.\n\nProgress in adolescent health and wellbeing: tracking 12 headline indicators for 195 countries and territories 1990-2016 (Lancet).

    "Paul Cocksedge"
  ],
  "text": "When the designer Paul Cocksedge was told he had to move out of his east London studio early last year, he decided to make something of it. Literally. Hiring his own core drillers, he started to remove cylindrical blocks from the studio floor. \u201cWe\u2019d been here for over 10 years,\u201d he says, \u201cand I wanted to keep some of it for myself, take it with me. A lot had happened here.\u201d\n\nWhat started as something of a protest against the gentrification of an area that had once been synonymous with cheap rents and creativity, as well a romantic act of memory, also turned into a piece of urban archaeology. The drilling revealed layers of London history, the material below his floor turning from concrete filled with stony aggregate to clay bricks over 100 years old. Once polished, the cylinders became elements of furniture \u2014 the smallest as supports for glass shelves, the longest as legs for a glass-topped table \u2014 which went on show at last year\u2019s Salone in Milan, the city\u2019s annual furniture fair. The studio interns might have been thrown by the experience: \u201cThey thought they\u2019d come to work on [the drawing software] CAD, and then I handed them a drill,\u201d laughs Cocksedge. In fact, they\u2019d helped create one of strongest bodies of work to be shown in Milan that week.\n\nThanks to Brexit, I find Cocksedge in the same studio just a few weeks ago, a ramshackle workshop filled with prototypes and tools. The UK\u2019s uncertain future has halted, if not reversed, the escalation of land values in Hackney, and Cocksedge\u2019s landlord has decided to delay any development of the studio\u2019s site. In the meantime, the designer has refilled the 1,500 holes he made last year, though ghostly traces are visible beneath the newly applied grey floorpaint.\n\nThe latest project to emerge from here is an installation that will function as the Swire Properties VIP Lounge at Art Basel Hong Kong, a pop-up space situated on the first-floor concourse of the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. The location is as inauspicious as it sounds, but the 40-year-old Cocksedge likes a challenge. This is a man, after all, who\u2019s constructed a table out of two identical L-shaped wings of sheet steel, its 500kg perfectly balanced where the two upright surfaces join. It now belongs to an American collector.\n\nA sketch for \u2018Spectrum\u2019, the Swire Properties VIP Lounge at Art Basel Hong Kong\n\n\u201cYou just have to respond to the space you\u2019re given,\u201d he says, jumping up to grab a makeshift model \u2014 a rough block of wood, where brightly coloured rubber bands are wound around three dowel rods to form a triangular shape. \u201cAnd this one in Hong Kong has huge columns in it, so we decided to use them.\u201d For the job itself, the rubber bands will be replaced by webbing \u2014 the sort used for slacklining ropes \u2014 in a blue and red that will be wound around the columns to create a triangular central volume.\n\n\u201cSo many exhibitions invest a lot in materials which then get thrown away after just a few days. We\u2019ve tried to dematerialise the installation as much as possible. The webbing could even be used again.\u201d\n\nArt lovers, meanwhile, will notice similarities between Cocksedge\u2019s solution and the work of artists like Fred Sandback and Lygia Pape, who used string to create finely drawn volumes in space.\n\nSo many exhibitions invest a lot in materials which then get thrown away. We\u2019ve tried to dematerialise\n\nThis project is sponsored by Swire Properties, the Hong Kong developer with whom Cocksedge has worked before, animating the cavernous atrium of a shopping mall in Shanghai with a permanent installation of hundreds of furled Corian pieces, like sheets of paper caught in a flurry of wind. His studio relies on these one-off commissions. He\u2019s about to take on another atrium, this time in an apartment block in London\u2019s Stratford, for a London developer he met at a design dinner. Another new installation illuminates the new flagship store of Cos in King\u2019s Cross: six rings of light hung inside a long window which come to life as the sun goes down at night.\n\nHe has worked like this ever since he graduated from the Royal College of Art in 2002, and set up his studio with Joana Pinho, a visual communications graduate. \u201cAt Christmas, when you stop working for a bit, you do think: \u2018What\u2019s next?\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly like I have a plan.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Mark Cocksedge\n\nTwo works from Cocksedge\u2019s series \u2018Freeze\u2019, exhibited in New York at Friedman Benda in 2015 \u00a9 Mark Cocksedge\n\nIn New York, Cocksedge is looked after by the design gallery Friedman Benda, which has helped deliver some of his more wilful (and expensive) projects. They include \u201cFreeze\u201d, a series of furniture he started working on in 2014, fusing together a range of metals through freezing. The first experiments involved a trip to Austria, where he buried an aluminium table top and copper legs on a mountainside in deep snow overnight. (The process can be replicated with liquid nitrogen.) Since then, he has been working with the biggest manufacturer of toilet doors in North America to make the same process viable for fitting out prisons, schools, airports and caf\u00e9s. \u201cOne thing leads to another,\u201d says Cocksedge. \u201cThe toilet door guy saw the \u2018Freeze\u2019 project in a copy of Wallpaper magazine that he\u2019d picked up on a plane.\u201d\n\nHe is working on the interior design for a new sportswear brand in Milan, and a perfume bottle for a Korean company. In Oman, he is creating a canopy for the world\u2019s largest botanical gardens, which will provide both a view of the sky and shade throughout the day.\n\nA rendering of a canopy Cocksedge is creating for the world\u2019s largest botanical gardens in Oman\n\nBut Cocksedge is fundamentally a free spirit and a self-starter \u2014 somewhere between an activist, designer and inventor. He seems happiest combing the local streets for inspiration. When his bike lights kept being stolen, he came up with the Double O, a circular LED model that you can pop in your pocket, and which also creates a softer and better diffused light for the cyclist. And after continually finding speakers abandoned around his neighbourhood, he raised \u00a3101,000 on Kickstarter, and created a small cube in a soft plastic that houses a battery, Bluetooth and an amplifier, which can be popped on top of the most battered old piece of kit.\n\n\u201cPeople were buying these Beats by Dre things for \u00a3200,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that\u2019s just about restyling. The sound was perfected years ago.\u201d The Vamp costs \u00a349 and so far they have sold 10,000. By way of demonstration, Cocksedge connects his iPhone to the small red cube, pops it on top of a single down-at-heel speaker, and The Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cCan\u2019t You Hear me Knocking\u201d reverberates around the studio. VIP lounges are all very well, but the Vamp looks more like the future to me.\n\nFollow @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

  "text": "When Ben Brown opened his Hong Kong gallery in the nine-storey neoclassical Pedder Building in Central in 2009, his neighbouring tenants were not quite what an aspirational art crowd might expect. \u201cThe building was full of closing-down cashmere shops and fake Louis Vuitton vendors. In truth, it was pretty ghastly,\u201d Brown recalls.\n\nDespite the unorthodox set-up, opportunities quickly sprouted for the Hong Kong-born, London-based dealer. Among Brown\u2019s first clients was a Hong Kong collector who was buying a wedding gift in a shop next door when he happened to hear that Brown was selling a \u201cvery small but very lovely\u201d Pablo Picasso drawing for less than $100,000. \u201cIt was his first Picasso; he\u2019s since bought around 10 pieces from me,\u201d Brown says.\n\nIt was a fortuitous sign \u2014 back then, \u201cnobody was showing great western art\u201d, Brown explains. Most collectors either bought traditional Chinese art \u2014 scroll paintings, ceramics and jade \u2014 or contemporary Chinese art, which was undergoing a speculatively fuelled, shortlived boom at the time.\n\nDetermined to create a gallery cluster, Brown set out to enrol other dealers in Pedder Building, including Lisson Gallery\u2019s Nicholas Logsdail. \u201cHe was impressed by the space but he ended up going to New York instead,\u201d Brown rues. Lisson is finally taking the plunge in China, opening a space in Shanghai this month.\n\nPedder\u2019s gallery credentials were cemented in 2011 when Gagosian moved in. It was the year China rocketed to the top spot in the global art market, with Asia\u2019s mushrooming billionaire club a lure for western art dealers. \u201cWe wanted to be in a hub city in Asia where we could reach collectors across the continent,\u201d says Gagosian\u2019s managing director Nick Simunovic, adding that Hong Kong\u2019s business-friendly, tax-free status was a huge incentive.\n\nRon Arad\u2019s \u2018In a China Shop\u2019 (2009)\n\nThe next few years represented a seismic shift in attitudes towards international modern and contemporary art, which brought western dealers flocking to Hong Kong. Six top-flight galleries, including Lehmann Maupin and Simon Lee, now occupy Pedder, while in 2018 the nearby H Queen\u2019s gallery building officially opened, with David Zwirner, Pace and Hauser & Wirth among its high-profile tenants.\n\nIt was conceived as a commercial building but designed by the Hong Kong architect and collector William Lim with art exhibitions in mind. I ask if Brown was ever tempted to relocate to the more high-tech H Queen\u2019s. \u201cAbsolutely! I went to have a look,\u201d he shoots back. \u201cBoth buildings have their pros and cons: location, price, ceiling height, easy access, management, etc. But the fact that nobody has moved says a lot.\u201d\n\nOther cultural districts to crop up in recent years include Wong Chuk Hang on Hong Kong\u2019s beachy Southside, where rents are a snip of those in eye-wateringly pricey Central, and, currently under way, the \u00a32.6bn, 70-acre cultural district called Victoria Dockside, masterminded by the Hong Kong developer and collector Adrian Cheng.\n\nLubna Chowdhary\u2019s \u2018Certain Times VI\u2019 (2019), at Jhaveri Contemporary in Art Basel Hong Kong\u2019s Discoveries section\n\nIf there is one event universally credited with putting Hong Kong on the international art map, it is Art Basel Hong Kong, which replaced Art HK in 2013. The Hong Kong-born collector Patrick Sun is among those full of praise for the art fair. \u201cArt Basel\u2019s arrival was pivotal. The contemporary art scene really picked up afterwards,\u201d says Sun, who started out buying traditional Chinese painting but switched his focus to \u201cgay Asian contemporary art\u201d around five years ago.\n\n\u201cBut if you go back to before Art Basel, Ben Brown was one of the early believers in Hong Kong. He was one of the visionaries who kick-started things.\u201d\n\nAt this year\u2019s fair, Brown is showing six semi-abstract landscapes by his mother, painted in the 1980s. Describing them as \u201cnot particularly valuable but rather good\u201d, Brown has modestly priced the works at HK$120,000 (US$15,280) each.\n\nAn accomplished painter, Rosamond Brown moved to Hong Kong in the mid-1960s when she was just 26. She soon ingratiated herself into the art scene, ordering acrylic paint for fellow artists Hon Chi-fun, Gaylord Chan and Cheung Yee in exchange for tutorials in how to use a Chinese brush.\n\nThe impetus for Brown to show his mother\u2019s work came from Adeline Ooi, the director of Art Basel Hong Kong, who told the dealer the fair needed more Hong Kong women artists, a sentiment he fully supports.\n\nRosamond Brown in her studio at 5 Pollock\u2019s Path, 1987 \u00a9 Frank Fishbeck\n\nThe Brown family are also behind one of Hong Kong\u2019s only museum acquisition funds, which provides a modest but regular budget for M+ to buy works at the fair. The HK$5m 10-year fund, modelled on a mixture of the Tate\u2019s Outset fund and the Turner Prize, will run until 2024. In 2012, meanwhile, the former Swiss ambassador to China, Uli Sigg, donated his $163m art collection to M+.\n\nIn a country where philanthropy is not high on the agenda (there are few tax breaks for Chinese collectors), Brown feels a sense of civic duty to fill some of the gap. \u201cQuite frankly, [art] has helped us make money, so we should give some back,\u201d he reasons.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s museum scene as a whole has been woefully lacking, but here too the tide is turning. The Tai Kwun Centre for Heritage and Arts opened last May, while the Hong Kong Museum of Art is currently undergoing a HK$930m renovation. Most hotly anticipated, however, is M+, the crown jewel of the West Kowloon Cultural District, which is due to launch in 2020 after repeated delays.\n\nBrown believes M+ will bring balance to Hong Kong\u2019s reputation for being hyper-commercial. \u201cCurrently, if you want to go and see great art, you go to someone who has a vested interest in selling you something. Hong Kong is lacking an unbiased eye, an institution that will tell you \u2018this is great art\u2019 without placing a monetary value on it. That\u2019s what M+ will rectify,\u201d he says.\n\nThe site of the upcoming M+ museum in Hong Kong \u00a9 West Kowloon Cultural District Authority; Graham Uden/FPG\n\nThe museum\u2019s opening will cap a decade of rapid growth in the Chinese art market, but the next 10 years appear less bullish, according to a new report released by Tefaf art fair earlier this month. Reinforcing current trends, the report suggests that western dealers will continue to expand their piece of the pie, but at the expense of Chinese galleries and artists.\n\nBrown is optimistic that there is plenty to go round, despite a slowing Chinese economy. \u201cChina will have its ups and downs, but I predict that the upper middle classes, as well as [those] in Indonesia and the Philippines, will get richer,\u201d he says. \u201cNew people will begin to buy art and they will get used to the fact that it is not a pure investment.\u201d\n\nThat said, Brown makes no bones about the fact he is in Hong Kong to make money. \u201cIf that stops and I can\u2019t do anything about it, then I will shut down. But at the moment I am very happy.\u201d\n\nArt Basel Hong Kong, March 29-31\n\nThis article has been amended to reflect the fact that the Pablo Picasso drawing was sold for less than $100,000, not less than HK$100,000\n\nFollow @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

  "text": "The mighty Chinese art market, now worth more than US$13bn a year according to the latest Art Basel/UBS Global Art Market report, grew with extreme speed, powered by a number of significant milestones in the wake of the Cultural Revolution. One of the best known, just 40 years ago, was the illicit event staged by a number of (mostly) self-taught artists in Beijing in September 1979. After being rejected by official institutions, they defied the authorities and used some of the city\u2019s park railings to hang works that flew in the face of Socialist Realism and explored forbidden western styles such as abstract expressionism.\n\nAlthough this display by the Stars Group (Xingxing) was rapidly closed down by the authorities, they succeeded in creating a further exhibition, not long afterwards, this time inside the National Art Museum of China in Beijing: it drew more than 80,000 visitors. As well as open-air shows they staged street demonstrations and public readings which attracted equally large crowds, and proved equally disturbing to officialdom. So although the group was a significant force in the gradual loosening of the cultural stranglehold of the Cultural Revolution, it was inevitably short-lived, and by 1983 its members had mostly dispersed or moved abroad to avoid harsh political strictures.\n\nSome of the artists in the group \u2014 Ai Weiwei among them \u2014 have since become leading lights of the Chinese contemporary art scene, after leaving China to expand their practice. Others remained in China throughout and are therefore perhaps less well known internationally, even though their work has been no less creatively important in the country\u2019s transformation.\n\nAt Art Basel Hong Kong, the gallery 10 Chancery Lane is celebrating the Stars Group by showing work by three of its members \u2014 Huang Rui, Wang Keping and Ma Desheng. Huang Rui still maintains his belief in art\u2019s power to effect social change, while Wang Keping\u2019s sculptures, exploring the human form, seem equally inspired by western modernists and Taoist ideas of simplicity and nature. Ma Desheng, who left China in the early 1980s and now lives in Paris, has a varied practice that includes abstract acrylic on canvas.\n\nWang Keping\u2019s \u2018Silence\u2019 (2007)\n\nUntitled woodblock print (1979) by Ma Desheng\n\n10chancerylanegallery.com\n\nFollow @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

  "text": "\u201cWood!\u201d It was hard to contain my surprise. I\u2019d walked into the studio of Shirley Tse, in the Inglewood district of Los Angeles, expecting to meet the queen of plastics. A sculptor and installation artist who had made her name, and won plenty of acclaim, using plastic, polystyrene and other everyday mutable synthetics in her work. Instead I find her, a neat figure who combines the elegance of her Chinese heritage with the relaxed vibe of her adopted California, surrounded by turning lathes.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you worked in wood.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither did I!\u201d She laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely new for me.\u201d\n\nShe sets out to explain the path that has brought her here.\n\n\u201cThough I\u2019ve become known as the artist working with synthetic materials, I don\u2019t really see myself as only focused on materials \u2014 from the get-go it\u2019s always been about both idea and material, both concept and object. At some point people decided to describe my work as very material-oriented, it\u2019s quite irksome really. Because even at the beginning, when I was using a lot of plastic and styrofoam, I chose that for a reason \u2014 how it signified globalisation, movement \u2014 and most importantly, paradoxes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such an interesting substance. It\u2019s temporal in use but permanent in substance. It\u2019s something we see everywhere, but it\u2019s so alien. This is a material that at one point was totally utopian, but within a span of 20 years had become totally dystopian. It\u2019s a substance that embodies all these paradoxes . . .\n\n\u201cSo the new work I\u2019m doing is really a continuation, a way to continue to work with that multiplicity.\u201d\n\nMultiplicity, I quickly realise, is at the heart of Tse\u2019s thinking. Her workaday studio has shelves of books; she quotes philosophers and literary metaphors as well as science. An easy fluency with the emotive language of art coexists with a more analytic eloquence \u2014 she is, after all, a professor in the School of Art at California Institute of the Arts.\n\nMany-strandedness was also at the heart of Tse\u2019s last show \u2014 Lift Me Up So I Can See Better, based loosely on the Oscar Wilde story \u201cThe Happy Prince\u201d, which is replete with metaphor: social, emotional, human, political. Here her materials included glass, copper, found objects and more, and incorporated narrative and figuration in pieces that, she says, explored \u201cverticality\u201d. Proof, perhaps, that you\u2019d pigeonhole this artist at your peril.\n\n2014\u2019s Quantum Shirley, too, was a show that crystallised Tse\u2019s fascination with quantum physics and the ideas of multiple worlds and parallel realities. That differences coexist.\n\n\u201cGetting older,\u201d she says, \u201cyou think about choices and crossroads and the path you didn\u2019t take. I was reading a lot about quantum theory and I realised, you know what, that path did exist, I just don\u2019t have access to it. I find that idea very poetic and powerful \u2014 but also how crazy is it that now science gives validity to that kind of thinking, which would once have been so outlandish.\u201d\n\nAll her sculptures, she has said, are 'models of multi-dimensional thinking and negotiation' \u00a9 Maggie Shannon\n\nWe circle back to the journey that brought her in the early 1990s to California from her native Hong Kong, where she grew up the fourth child of factory-working parents. She tells me a convoluted history of diasporic labour. \u201cMy parents weren\u2019t even really Chinese: I have very little connection to mainland China, actually. Well in fact they were Chinese, but my dad was born in Indonesia, my mom in Malaysia. My mother\u2019s family had gone to Malaysia to work on the rubber plantations, run by the British, then the family moved to the South Pacific, to work for the French on vanilla bean plantations \u2014 so my family were part of global trade movement, colonial products . . . no wonder I\u2019m interested in plastic!\n\n\u201cIt all makes sense to me. But the idea is so huge, I couldn\u2019t put it all in one single work, it has become a series. It\u2019s like a framework to express my personal story, how science can make sense of imaginative vision, the movement of colonial trade, the history of the Chinese diaspora . . .\n\n\u201cAnd now in my recent work I really want to focus on how things are put together, how they negotiate with each other to form some sort of structure.\u201d\n\nAll her sculptures, she has said, are \u201cmodels of multi-dimensional thinking and negotiation\u201d. Yet the sheer materiality of things is never far from her mind. Suddenly excited by the wood, she jumps up to show me turned objects \u2014 a bottle, a baseball bat \u2014 that will form part of her site-specific piece for the forthcoming Venice Biennale, where she will represent Hong Kong.\n\nThe Hong Kong pavilion, which stands directly opposite the Arsenale, is an inside-outside courtyarded space, and the solo exhibition, entitled Stakeholders and curated by Christina Li, consists of two elements. A model of \u201cNegotiated Differences\u201d, formed of different weights and lengths of curving wood, joined by special 3D-printed links and punctuated by everyday objects (bottle, part of a prosthetic leg, drinking cup, tampon) turned in wood, shows an elaborate modular winding structure \u2014 an endless series of connection, a journey without start or finish \u2014 that will weave through the entire space, and erupt into the courtyard with \u201cPlay Court\u201d, a set of strong vertical structures evoking radio masts, ships\u2019 masts, watchtowers and more.\n\nAs usual, Tse sees the work as a merging of literal and abstract ideas and, of course, Venice\u2019s particular identity as a historic trade nexus strongly evokes the convergence of colonialism and product, displacement and trade. \u201cSome of the work addresses the actual narrative, elements of it address the idea of going between two places. Those confluences . . . \u201d she says.\n\nAnd those paradoxes, again.\n\nVenice Biennale, May 11-November 24\n\nFollow @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

  "text": "It was difficult to avoid discussion of Brexit at this year\u2019s Tefaf art fair, held in Maastricht, where the treaty that founded the EU was signed in 1992. \u201cParliament voting was happening throughout the set-up and preview days [March 13-15]. If there had been indications of a hard Brexit, that would have affected the mood,\u201d says Patrick van Maris van Dijk, chief executive of Tefaf. As it was, he says, once a no-deal exit was rejected, \u201csterling immediately went up and everyone breathed a sigh of relief\u201d \u2014 there are 71 UK dealers among Tefaf\u2019s 279 exhibitors this year.\n\nElsewhere, the upgraded Modern art section proved a winning draw as more VIP visitors than usual seemed to turn right on entry this year (the Old Masters paintings dealers, normally the first port of call, are on the left). Older works are still the fair\u2019s more distinct offering, though, and highlights this year include a jewel-like painting of two young sisters, Juana and Isabel de Arag\u00f3n y Pernstein, by Antonio Ricci, dated to about 1598-99, partly by using the clothes and hairstyles of the sitters (Rob Smeets, \u20ac220,000). A gold Renaissance marriage necklace (c1583-91) that originally belonged to Friedrich Wilhelm I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, sold from Les Enluminures ($350,000). It is not known whether the necklace was offered to the duke\u2019s first or second wife. It was also once in the British Rail Pension Fund, which invested some \u00a340m in fine and decorative art between 1974 and 1980.\n\nTefaf Maastricht runs until Sunday.\n\nUp to $7.3m of art from the collection of the disgraced international jeweller Nirav Modi, who was arrested in London as this column went to print, comes to auction at Saffronart in Mumbai on Tuesday. Modi left his home country of India last year amid accusations by the state-owned Punjab National Bank of perpetrating a $2bn fraud, which he has denied. India\u2019s government has since seized his assets in the country, including 68 works of mostly Indian Modern and contemporary art. Mumbai\u2019s income tax department is now offering these at a live auction on March 26, to begin recovery of the Rs95.9 crore ($14m) that it specifies is owed.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time that an auction house has been taken on for this type of sale in India, says Abha Housego, vice-president of Saffronart. \u201cThe value of Indian art only really started to go up in 2008, so it hasn\u2019t really been an option until recently,\u201d she says.\n\nMuch of the collection\u2019s expected value comes from VS Gaitonde\u2019s meditative \u201cUntitled\u201d (1973), estimated at between $3.5m and $4.5m. This was included in New York\u2019s Solomon R Guggenheim\u2019s 2014-15 solo show. Other highlights include Raja Ravi Varma\u2019s 1881 painting of an official visit to Kerala by the third Duke of Buckingham (est $1.8m-$2.6m), a national treasure so it can\u2019t be exported. Among the contemporary fare is Jitish Kallat\u2019s \u201cUntitled (Eclipse) \u2014 6\u201d (2007-08, est $88,000-$118,000).\n\nTracey Emin\u2019s \u2018George Loves Kenny\u2019 (2007), sold at Christie\u2019s auction of works belonging to the late singer George Michael\n\nChristie\u2019s often sells a single painting for more than the total \u00a37.5m (\u00a39.3m with fees) that it made from 61 works that belonged to the singer George Michael. But its energetic marketing efforts ahead of the March 14 sale give a clue to the power of a celebrity collection.\n\nOverall, the within-estimate auction proved a mixed bag as some high-profile disappointments \u2014 notably below-par prices for expected star attractions by Damien Hirst \u2014 overshadowed some of the showbiz buzz. Hirst\u2019s formaldehyde works \u201cThe Incomplete Truth\u201d (2006) and \u201cSaint Sebastian, Exquisite Pain\u201d (2007) both hammered long before hitting their \u00a31.5m high estimates, fetching \u00a3750,000 (\u00a3911,250 with fees) and \u00a3720,000 (\u00a3875,250 with fees) respectively and extending the ongoing drift in value for Hirst\u2019s work.\n\nThe standout performer was Michael\u2019s friend Tracey Emin, perhaps benefiting from her well-received show at White Cube in London. Her messy, acrylic \u201cHurricane\u201d (2007) went for \u00a3350,000 (\u00a3431,250 with fees, est \u00a3120,000-\u00a3180,000), while her neon \u201cGeorge Loves Kenny\u201d (2007), a reference to Michael\u2019s one-time partner, the art dealer Kenny Goss, drew a heartfelt round of applause when it sold for \u00a3280,000 (\u00a3347,250 with fees, est \u00a340,000-\u00a360,000).\n\nSubsequent online sales of \u00a32m pushed the fee-inclusive total to \u00a311.3m for works mostly by Young British Artists. Proceeds headed to charities that Michael supported before he died in 2016.\n\nArt Dubai, which opened in the Madinat Jumeirah resort on Wednesday, was launched back in 2007 as the Gulf Art Fair, just before such events became two-a-penny. Chief executive Ben Floyd, who co-founded the fair with the London dealer John Martin, says he has witnessed much cultural change since. \u201cThe city is unrecognisable now,\u201d he says, noting that there were only about seven commercial galleries back in 2007; now, he says, there are around 30, including a dozen on Alserkal Avenue, a cultural district established in 2008.\n\nFloyd and the fair\u2019s artistic director Pablo del Val acknowledge that the market\u2019s growth has been relatively slow, given that the critically acclaimed Sharjah Biennial for contemporary art began back in 1993. Certainly, Dubai doesn\u2019t seem to have the turbocharged momentum of cities such as Hong Kong and Shanghai, but this may prove a more sustainable environment. Del Val says: \u201cWe are building something thoughtful here, and that takes time.\u201d\n\nThe young German artist Dennis Buck has a clear sense of the direction of today\u2019s art market. Many of his pieces put his name, the work\u2019s title, date, medium and sometimes dimensions prominently on the canvas. \u201cI feel more like a small-business owner [than an artist],\u201d Buck told visitors to his exhibition at London\u2019s Roman Road gallery last week, while talking about the realities of \u201cderomanticising\u201d his profession. The artist even offers us his telephone number through some works, which doubles as the title of the exhibition: \u201c+491522414NAME\u201d (until April 28, canvases \u00a33,500-\u00a37,500).\n\nFollow @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

  "title": "Meet the artists exhibiting at Encounters, Art Basel Hong Kong",
  "authors": [

  "text": "The Encounters section at Art Basel Hong Kong, where large-scale sculptures and installations are shown, will reflect \u201cthe accelerated sense of absurdity at a time where persistent political revolutions and social uprisings are part of our new normal\u201d, according to Alexie Glass-Kantor, the section\u2019s curator for the fifth year running. \u201cThe theme, \u2018Still We Rise\u2019, explores thresholds between life and death, between collapse and resurrection.\u201d\n\nOver half the participants are from the region, she says. \u201cMost of these artists are also not household names.\u201d This year\u2019s presentation includes eight site-specific projects and four existing installations (all the works are for sale).\n\nJo\u00ebl Andrianomearisoa\n\nThe Malagasy artist is showing his sculptural installation \u201cThe Cartographies of Desire, the space between us\u201d (2019). Andrianomearisoa will represent Madagascar at the 58th Venice Biennale this summer, when the African country will present its first ever pavilion (Sabrina Amrani gallery).\n\nJo\u00ebl Andrianomearisoa\u2019s \u2018The Cartographies of Desire, the space between us\u2019 (2019) \u00a9 Jo\u00ebl Andrianomearisoa/Sabrina Amrani\n\nDescribe how the work is structured\n\nThe work consists of four lines of wood beams at different heights, from where 21 linen sheets with silk paper elements hang. One of the beams holds seven fluorescent lamps, which mark the acts into which the work is divided.\n\nIs it a painting, a sculpture or an architectural assemblage?\n\nIt is neither a painting, a sculpture nor an architectural assemblage, although it has something of each. The work is an installation that has different elements that refer to architecture, painting and sculpture, but also to love, desire, loss, despair and hope.\n\nDo you think visitors to the art fair will focus on the work for as long as you would like them to?\n\nI hope so. I think that, despite the context of a fair, where art is viewed and consumed at a very fast pace, the Encounters sector [encourages] visitors to focus on the works for an appropriate amount of time. The installation is very haptic but inaccessible at the same time: an inviting labyrinth that you cannot enter.\n\nMit Jai Inn\n\nThe audience is invited to walk on and through the work \u201cPlanes (Electric)\u201d (2019), by the Thai artist. The piece combines large-scale, thickly layered, vibrant paintings draped across the floor, and a series of large scrolls (Silverlens and TKG+ gallery).\n\nMit Jai Inn\u2019s \u2018Planes (Electric)\u2019 (2019) \u00a9 Mit Jai Inn/Silverlens and TKG+\n\nIs the visitor meant to immerse him/herself in the work?\n\nThe work for Encounters includes eight paintings \u2014 a spiritual number. [It represents] different ways of being, hanging from high above, holding power like a monument, or hanging lower, unfurling across the ground, rolling out a space for us. There are times we are floating. In the womb we float. For me, painting should act that way: be above, around and underneath you. It should act like a spirit, floating in between.\n\nWill the work mimic urban life in some way?\n\n\u201cPlanes (Electric)\u201d is something like a camp, a refuge, a walled but open enclosure of vibrations. We are in relation to everything around us. Electricity can refer to these relational vibrations, to the spirit of a city such as Hong Kong, its light and its movement.\n\nIs this your most ambitious work yet?\n\nI never have ambition. I try to be a good human every day.\n\nLee Bul\n\nThe Korean artist presents a new version of her replica Zeppelin \u201cWilling To Be Vulnerable \u2014 Metalized Balloon\u201d (2019), seen last year at the Hayward Gallery in London. \u201cThis piece is 12 metres long, and will be suspended over the heads of fair-goers. I like its robust physicality,\u201d Glass-Kantor says. \u201cLee Bul grew up under the dictatorship of Park Chung-hee, and there is a precarious balance between beauty and menace in her work.\u201d (Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Lehmann Maupin and PKM Gallery)\n\nLee Bul\u2019s \u2018Willing To Be Vulnerable \u2014 Metalized Balloon\u2019 (2019)\n\nIs the work intended to highlight the ways in which technology can fail humanity?\n\nAll technology entails [the] human desire for realising the ideal. In my view, the process of its failure is humanity itself.\n\nWill it be strange seeing it in a different context?\n\nThis work was originally presented at the 20th Sydney Biennale in 2016 under the theme of \u201cThe future is already here \u2014 it\u2019s just not evenly distributed\u201d. Now, at Art Basel Hong Kong, I am trying to show this work in a new context.\n\nWould you rather the work ends up in a private collection or a museum?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t really matter if the work is acquired by a private collection or a museum. Rather, it is more important that the work is situated where it can create its own context consistently.\n\nPinaree Sanpitak\n\nBangkok-born Sanpitak is showing \u201cThe Walls\u201d (2019), an intricate and delicate maze-like work made from sheets of handmade paper (STPI \u2014 Creative Workshop and Gallery, Singapore).\n\nPinaree Sanpitak\u2019s \u2018The Walls\u2019 (2019) \u00a9 Pinaree Sanpitak/STPI\n\nHow did this work develop?\n\n\u201cThe Walls\u201d has evolved from large-scale installations dating from the past two years: \u201cThe Roof\u201d (2017), \u201cThe Mats and The Pillows\u201d (2017-18) and \u201cThe House is Crumbling\u201d (2017-18). \u201cThe Walls\u201d is beyond a particular individual. It is about all of us, despite differences in gender or race.\n\nIs this work meant to disorient visitors?\n\n\u201cThe Walls\u201d can be installed in various configurations depending on the site. This first set-up is both open and closed and can be viewed in 360 degrees. It is structured yet organic and fragile, a condition not unlike what surrounds us, which we have to navigate each day.\n\nWhat are you working on next?\n\nI am working on painting and collage works for Yavuz Gallery in Singapore, and also on two community-based projects with the people of Honjima for this year\u2019s Setouchi Triennale and the Hancock Shaker Village in the US in 2021. I\u2019m also compiling an inventory of my works for a monograph that will be published next year.\n\nZhao Zhao\n\nA former assistant to Ai Weiwei, Zhao Zhao created \u201cIn Extremis\u201d (2018) after noticing traces of a cat\u2019s body flattened into the asphalt outside his studio by passing vehicles (Tang Contemporary).\n\nZhao Zhao\u2019s \u2018In Extremis\u2019 (2018) \u00a9 Zhao Zhao and Tang Contemporary Art\n\nWill fairgoers be able to walk on the work, stamping on the images of the dead cats?\n\nThis will be an interactive installation, and visitors will be invited to walk on the asphalt area, though we need to protect the brass and metal parts, and will have staff guarding the work.\n\nIs the work about mortality and the sanctity of life?\n\n\u201cIn Extremis\u201d literally means \u201cat the point of death\u201d. The life experience at this moment is very abstract. It is difficult to imagine this state without experiencing it in person. At this time, all lives, whether human or animal, are equal. They will all face this ultimate personal experience.\n\nIs it a comment on Chinese society?\n\nIn every period of human society, construction and warfare nurtured and buried individual vitality and chances of survival. All this praise for modern revolution implies the \u201cwinning\u201d of human civilisation as a whole. These public and collective wins, countless individual choices and encounters, hurts and sacrifices, and ultimate memories, have become collateral conditions within collective discourse. The dead animal became the subordinate symbol.\n\nDo you consider yourself a conceptual artist or a political artist?\n\nI would rather not label myself or define my own style.\n\nFollow @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

  "authors": [
    "Baya Simons",
    "Visual Arts"
  ],
  "text": "\u201cI don\u2019t feel as though I\u2019m just existing in one visual history,\u201d says the ceramic artist Lubna Chowdhary. \u201cCulturally my background is quite diverse and often at odds. Minimalism and ornamentation don\u2019t always come together, so I\u2019m interested in how to bring them together.\u201d She appears to have succeeded. In her garden studio in south-west London, the precisely cut geometric tiles that line the walls are hand-glazed in fizzy sherbet colours.\n\nBut her harmonious aesthetic did not come easily. Born in Tanzania to Indian parents, then raised in the north of England before studying at the Royal College of Art in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Chowdhary struggled to find a visual language that represented the multiple strands of her identity.\n\n\u201cThe language of white male artists was being presented to me all the time,\u201d she recalls, dressed majestically in an emerald-green shirt dress and red lipstick. \u201cAnd I really didn\u2019t have anything in common with it. In craft, it was the tradition of Bernard Leach, and I just found it dull and uninspiring. The lack of colour, the earthy surfaces. Ceramics were vessel-formed, plinth-based, quite conventional. And my work didn\u2019t fit that format.\u201d\n\nIt was the discovery of the anthropological collections in museums such as the V&A and Oxford\u2019s Pitt Rivers that gave Chowdhary a framework for her own thinking. \u201cIt was the first time I\u2019d seen non-European objects in institutions, and I was just so relieved to see things that were made of a variety of materials, where you could see the maker\u2019s hand at play.\u201d\n\nIndeed visible throughout her works is the curator\u2019s impulse to draw together groups of objects in order to tell a story. For her ongoing work \u201cMetropolis\u201d, which took over the Asian and European Ceramics Gallery of the V&A in 2017, she made over 1,000 miniature clay sculptures, laid out on the floor in a random arrangement. The result is a sea of works, each drawing on an overwhelming number of reference points, from satellite technology to kitchen equipment and children\u2019s toys. \u201cIt\u2019s a piece that explores hybrid languages of making and hybrid cultures,\u201d she explains, \u201cand traverses different times, histories and geographies.\u201d\n\nLubna Chowdhary\u2019s \u2018Certain Times VI\u2019 (2019), at Jhaveri Contemporary in Art Basel Hong Kong\u2019s Discoveries section\n\nBut where \u201cMetropolis\u201d was interested in objects, her recent work \u201cTableaux\u201d (which will occupy Jhaveri Contemporary\u2019s booth at this year\u2019s Art Basel Hong Kong) is more focused on architectures. \u201cIn Asian cities you see bamboo scaffolding against a skyscraper, against glass and steel. So this is about those juxtapositions,\u201d she says.\n\nIt is built from tiles that are drawn on Adobe Illustrator, then cut using precise waterjet technology, and glazed by hand in her studio \u2014 a combination of industrial techniques and hand-making. The pieces are then grouped together in small ceramic cities, what she calls \u201ccompositions\u201d. They are displayed leaned up against the wall \u2014 an effect that, she says, gives the work a sense of horizon, and the illusion of being able to walk around them.\n\nLubna Chowdhary\u2019s \u2018Certain Times VIII\u2019 (2019)\n\nFrom the sculptural busyness of \u201cMetropolis\u201d, how did she shift to the sparseness of tile? \u201cTile has a tradition in both the Middle East and here,\u201d she says, \u201ca tradition existing in two separate cultures. So it\u2019s nice to have a form where I can switch between references. For me tile became like paper for a collage artist.\u201d\n\nThe ways in which eastern and western visual traditions collide, intersect and mingle are at the heart of this new project. Flicking through sources on her laptop, Chowdhary talks me through the objects and images she worked with. One archive drawing shows a man dressed in a British army uniform from the colonial era, lying on a bolster smoking a hookah. \u201cBut he\u2019s got his shoes on!\u201d Chowdhary laughs, \u201cthat\u2019s a real no-no.\u201d\n\nLubna Chowdhary\u2019s \u2018Certain Times XV\u2019 (2019)\n\nAnother photograph shows a tea caddy made by an Indian craftsman, carved to look like an idyllic English country cottage. \u201cIt\u2019s the crossover of not just aesthetics but rituals and histories of the body,\u201d she says. \u201cEnglish people\u2019s ideas of what it was to be Indian, Indian people\u2019s ideas of what it was to be English.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a picture that Chowdhary stumbles across at the very end of the reel that makes it all fall into place for me: a photograph of a beautiful but random array of decorative objects arranged on a fireplace, taken in her parents\u2019 house. \u201cThey brought elements from every aspect of their culture with them,\u201d she says. \u201cAfrican figurines from Tanzania, souvenirs from their travels to Mecca, and then shire horses from their time in Lancashire. And it was all really ugly but it all kind of came together without any consideration as to how it would all work.\u201d It\u2019s by giving these cultural crossovers materiality that Chowdhary enables us to see them and explore them.\n\njhavericontemporary.com\n\nFollow @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

  "title": "Collector Alan Lo: \u2018We\u2019ve come a long way in the last 10 years\u2019",
  "authors": [
    "Georgina Adam",
    "Visual Arts"
  ],
  "text": "\u201cI\u2019d rather not mention the first work of art I bought!\u201d says the Hong Kong restaurateur, property investor and art collector Alan Lo. \u201cIt was a mistake! But I managed to get rid of it later.\n\n\u201cIt was by a contemporary Chinese artist. I bought it at auction in 2008, at a time when everyone was going crazy about all things Chinese,\u201d continues Lo, with a burst of laughter. \u201cThings were very different 10 years ago!\u201d\n\nThis is recounted with another burst of laughter, Lo swinging back in his chair to further emphasise the humour. We are speaking over Skype, Lo in Hong Kong and me in London. Looking younger than his 38 years, Lo is smartly dressed in a neat, pale raspberry-hued jacket with a small silk square tucked into the pocket and open-necked white shirt. Behind him hangs an ink painting by Nancy Chu Woo, the undated \u201cIceberg\u201d.\n\nBorn into a family where art collecting was firmly established, Lo was already going to auction previews with his father, Victor, at the age of eight. Chairman of the manufacturing business Gold Peak Industries, Victor Lo has been an avid collector of Chinese ink painting for almost 40 years, as well as being active in the arts community. He is heavily involved in the long-delayed museum M+, as chairman of its board and acquisitions committee.\n\nSo it is probably inevitable that Lo would collect; even before he started buying, he had been asked to serve on the advisory board of Art HK, the international art fair founded in 2007, which was subsequently bought by Art Basel in 2011 and became Art Basel Hong Kong.\n\nFirenze Lai\u2019s \u2018Examination\u2019 (2017) \u00a9 Collection of Alan Lo\n\n\u201cThat was an interesting time,\u201d says Lo. \u201cArt HK was quite an eye-opener; people weren\u2019t used to buying from galleries on the primary market \u2014 the benchmark was auction. The fair opened up a whole new dialogue here.\u201d\n\nLo qualified as an architect, but never practised \u2014 \u201cI knew I wasn\u2019t going to become a good one!\u201d he says. He was more interested in the hospitality industry, and started founding stylish restaurants \u2014 of which there are now 12, in Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai. After his marriage to boutique hotel entrepreneur Yenn Wong, in 2013 they co-founded Duddell\u2019s, the restaurant/club/art space that has now extended to London. \u201cAt the beginning, I was collecting contemporary Chinese art, but I slowly evolved into other areas \u2014 Japan, Korea and south-east Asia \u2014 and in 2011 I bought my first western work of art: a Sterling Ruby collage,\u201d he says.\n\nThe idea of a museum \u2018has definitely crossed my mind. But it needs to be relevant to the community\u2019\n\nToday his collection numbers about 100 works, and ranges widely \u2014 from Danh Vo to Zhang Enli, Yayoi Kusama and Paul Chan. \u201cI am a bit of a sucker for large-scale works which don\u2019t fit either in the lift or the stairs,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cAnd Hong Kong flats have low ceilings \u2014 for a long time I had to put a Liu Wei on its side!\u201d\n\nI wonder if there is a guiding line in his buying. \u201cFor a little while I thought I should be like my father, who has the ultimate, totally focused collection,\u201d says Lo. \u201cBut after a while I gave up, now my collection is just growing organically. And I have a full-time career, so I can\u2019t do all the homework, and if you aren\u2019t doing the homework, let someone else do it. So I used an adviser.\u201d That adviser was the Hong Kong-based Jehan Chu, who is now concentrating on another field; as a result, says Lo, \u201cI\u2019m having a break, exploring other options.\u201d\n\nSilke Otto-Knapp\u2019s \u2018Flamingo III\u2019 (2000) \u00a9 Collection of Alan Lo\n\nHe buys rapidly, and admits he sometimes makes mistakes. \u201cThen I keep it in storage, I try not to think about it,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cI always hope some day some magic will happen . . . \u201d\n\nSo will he make a museum one day? Lo thinks a little before replying. \u201cIt has definitely crossed my mind. But you need to think what the purpose is. Is it a response to the needs of the local community? And you have to think how you would position it with artists and the public.\u201d In fact, he would like to establish something \u2014 \u201cI think there is something missing, I don\u2019t know what \u2014 but I do know it needs to be relevant to the community.\u201d\n\nLo knows what he\u2019s talking about \u2014 he is already highly active in the arts community in Hong Kong and elsewhere \u2014 as chairman of the grant-making Design Trust, sitting on Art Basel\u2019s Global Patrons Council, the Tate Asia Pacific Acquisition Committee as well as being a board member of the non-profit art space Para Site. I ask him about the M+ museum, the recently opened Tai Kwun cultural site and other such initiatives. Is Hong Kong now catching up, culturally, with other centres?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way in the last 10 years,\u201d he responds. \u201cAnd in fact it is wrong to think that the collector scene is so recent \u2014 decades ago people were collecting ink painting, classical furniture and so on. But the difference is today\u2019s focus on contemporary art and design. I think there is some way to go, though. You can\u2019t rely on one institution such as M+ to do everything, and to have a healthy ecosystem you need artists, curators \u2014 and we have a huge shortage of curatorial talent. And there are needs on the art logistics side! I would ask the government for land to build a first-class art storage warehouse!\u201d\n\nBrent Wadden\u2019s \u2018Black Diamond\u2019 (2014) \u00a9 Collection of Alan Lo\n\nSpeaking of the government, I wonder whether Beijing\u2019s tightening grip on the territory can impact on Hong Kong\u2019s art scene. \u201cFor sure, we are becoming more Chinese,\u201d he responds. \u201cAnd there are instances of self-censorship. No doubt M+ is being closely watched, but the saving grace is that their board has fought to protect the core values of the museum. I think here in Hong Kong, you can talk about everything except any discussion about independence. Neither the local government nor Beijing will tolerate that.\u201d\n\nWe move on to talk about Duddell\u2019s, which during Art Basel Hong Kong is showing works by two Chinese artists, Wang Guangle and Li Shurui. They are from the collection of Lo\u2019s friend, Frenchman John Dodelande, and the show is curated by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Sans. \u201cI was intrigued as to why John collected Chinese art, so I decided to do this project. And I am so happy to have J\u00e9r\u00f4me to curate it!\u201d says Lo. And with that, and another burst of laughter, he bids me goodbye.\n\n\u2018Enlightening Times\u2019 is at Duddell\u2019s Hong Kong, March 24-June 23\n\nArt Basel Hong Kong is March 29-31\n\nThis article has been amended to reflect the fact that the painting \u2018Iceberg\u2019 was by Nancy Chu Woo, not Grace Woo\n\nFollow @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

  "title": "Jim Olson\u2019s perfect weekend in Seattle",
  "authors": [],
  "text": "Louie, our Labradoodle, doesn\u2019t respect weekends, so Saturday begins like every other day with a 6am walk in our neighbourhood. A free Saturday in the city is special, as my wife Katherine and I usually spend weekends at our cabin on Puget Sound \u2013 so when we stay here, we like to explore. The city is changing so fast that even though we have lived here for 40 years \u2013 the past 30 in a building I designed in the historic district\u2019s Pioneer Square \u2013 there is always something new to see.\n\nOur urban hike begins in Peter Miller Books just off First Avenue. It\u2019s one of the best architectural bookstores in America and I usually find something to tempt me; most recently it was an extraordinary book of photographs by Yukio Futagawa called Celestial Gardens: Kyoto Imperial Palace and Villa. Then we will call in at the Greg Kucera Gallery, just round the corner, which represents really interesting contemporary American artists such as Anne Appleby and Peter Millett.\n\nNext is Pike Place Market. Established in 1907, it\u2019s home to some wonderful, family-run shops where the owners always greet you \u2013 so important in today\u2019s big-brand world. We\u2019ll buy salmon for supper at Pure Food Fish Market, then stock up on the city\u2019s best olive oil at DeLaurenti and Brick House Select Pinot Noir and Januik Cabernet Sauvignon at Pike & Western Wine Shop, before visiting Turkish Delight to taste the day\u2019s baklava.\n\nBack on First Avenue, we split up to go to our favourite clothes stores. Katherine has always been a great dresser and likes the original clothes at Baby & Company. I go to the Jackstraw boutique next door: I like an interesting shirt and these are always beautifully tailored and detailed.\n\nLe Pichet, a small French bistro, is the perfect place for lunch. It does an excellent omelette and salad. I never drink at lunchtime, but we will treat ourselves to coffee and an apricot oatmeal pecan cookie at Macrina Bakery\u2019s Sodo caf\u00e9.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRestored, we\u2019ll then head to South Lake Union. It\u2019s a new \u201ccity within the city\u201d and everywhere you go there are buildings under construction \u2013 including the Wagner Education Center at The Center for Wooden Boats, which my partner Tom Kundig is designing. I find all this development exciting; there is an inherent optimism to living in a city that\u2019s becoming something new.\n\nWe spend the evening at home, grilling the fish and drinking wine on our leafy deck. We live on the top floor of our building and have views that take in the whole architectural history of Seattle.\n\nSundays are about relaxation and even when we\u2019re in the city we like to spend the day in the natural world. In the morning I make \u201ceggs in a nest\u201d, a recipe my father taught me where you break eggs into holes in slices of bread and bake them. I\u2019ve made it my own by adding what I find in the fridge, such as last night\u2019s leftover salmon.\n\nWe\u2019ll either head to the Seattle Asian Art Museum, a beautiful art deco building in Volunteer Park with a wonderful collection of historic art, or cross Lake Washington to go to the Bellevue Botanical Garden. Seattle has the best climate in the world for plants and, like everything in the city, this new garden is growing and growing.\n\nThe afternoon always includes a trip to the food lovers\u2019 Metropolitan Market in Uptown. We go for the week\u2019s groceries and maybe some fresh crab cakes for an easy supper. Otherwise, when we get home we walk half a block to Caf\u00e9 Paloma, a one-room Turkish restaurant where we feel part of the family. The lentil soup is so healthy it makes you feel like a better person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter supper, I\u2019ll read The New York Times, look at my calendar to prepare myself for the week ahead and, because Louie needs a bedtime walk, the weekend will finish just as it began."

  "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nAlisa Moussaieff sits beneath a chandelier in the upstairs salon of her intimate store on London\u2019s New Bond Street.\n\nIt has all the hallmarks of a classic luxury boutique, from the neutral palette and stiletto-sucking plush carpets, to the vitrines glittering with jewels. An Art Deco-style, brass-framed elevator transports VIP clients to a decadent mirrored-ceiling room.\n\nAt the age of 18, Alisa married Shlomo Moussaieff, a descendant of a family synonymous with jewels. His relatives trace their roots back to the 12th century and the days of Mongolian warrior Genghis Khan, who family legend claims was a client, buying pearls and gemstones to adorn his robes.\n\nMrs Moussaieff describes the early days of her marriage: \u201cAll one talked about was jewellery: who bought what, what was new on the market, what were the trends, which wonderful customers we can get and \u2014 which is more important \u2014 what wonderful pieces can we get.\u201d\n\nBut rather than play the role of passive wife, Mrs Moussaieff, who is now close to celebrating her 90th birthday, went into partnership with her husband, who died in 2016. Now, having spent five decades in what she describes as the \u201ccasino\u201d world of buying and trading gems, she is trying to adapt to the modern world.\n\nThe Moussaieffs moved to London from Israel in 1963 and opened a boutique in the Hilton Hotel on Park Lane \u2014 then a hotspot for moneyed international travellers \u2014 and began trading off the back of the family name.\n\nSoon the couple started adding their own star customers to the Moussaieff legacy, including Elizabeth Taylor and Frank Sinatra \u2014 as well as many others that discretion will never permit her to name.\n\nThough Moussaieff\u2019s clientele were high profile, the business itself tried to stay out of the limelight.\n\n\u201cWe always kept a low profile, under my direction,\u201d says the jeweller. \u201cWe did extremely well without the high profile, we didn\u2019t need it. We had the best of the best coming to us without any publicity.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no way today, when everybody is looking at everybody\u2019s Instagram, that you can stay discreet. I began to realise that we couldn\u2019t stay behind\n\nThen came the internet and, perhaps more importantly in her eyes, social media. This spelled the end for Moussaieff\u2019s low-key strategy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way today, when everybody is looking at everybody\u2019s Instagram, that you can stay discreet,\u201d she says. \u201cI began to realise that we couldn\u2019t stay behind. We\u2019ve got to flow with everybody else.\n\n\u201cNormally, I\u2019m not a follower, I try to be the first, but with this I was a follower. And I\u2019m still following, we\u2019re lagging behind.\u201d\n\nYou can now find Moussaieff\u2019s jewels on Instagram, where it has cleared the 100,000 follower mark. You can also see them on the red carpet as the brand begins to connect with celebrity stylists \u2014 Crazy Rich Asians star Michelle Yeoh wore nearly 180cts of its diamonds, including a necklace anchored with a rare 74ct natural fancy intense yellow diamond, as she presented the Cinematography Award at the Baftas this year.\n\nActress Michelle Yeoh wearing a Moussaieff diamond necklace at this year\u2019s Bafta awards \u00a9 Jeff Spicer/Getty Images\n\nMoussaieff\u2019s decision to open a store on New Bond Street in 2006 was also part of this quest for greater visibility, and it plans to open a Paris store within the next couple of years. It already has boutiques in several international locations, including Grand Hotel Kempinski in Geneva, Landmark in Hong Kong, and Immeuble les Grandes Alpes and Le Cap Horn in French ski resort Courchevel.\n\nMore recent moves, too, such as joining the line-up at London antiques fair Masterpiece, has seen the brand step further forward.\n\n\u201cBranding is what is required from a business today. In a way, I regret that I didn\u2019t start with the marketing before,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t need it, because everything went smoothly, so I was spoilt. But I could have been that many steps ahead now if I\u2019d started before.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if Moussaieff\u2019s clientele today continues to be the \u201cbest of the best\u201d, she is coy: \u201cYou have to aim for it, definitely.\u201d\n\nPendant with vivid blue diamond that sold at auction for $20m in May\n\nToday\u2019s buyers, she admits, are not as flash as the original Hilton crowd. The new generation in Europe and America are not into parking their money in jewels, she says, and younger Middle Eastern clients opt for \u201csmaller pieces than their parents, less blingy\u201d.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t want the very large diamonds now because they are not easy to shift,\u201d she adds.\n\nColoured diamonds are less of a slog, it would seem: a Moussaieff pendant set with an 8.01ct vivid blue diamond was purchased by an Asian client for HK$160m ($20.4m) at Christie\u2019s Hong Kong in May. \u201cThe Far East is the present and the future,\u201d insists Mrs Moussaieff.\n\nAfter five decades in the luxury jewellery business, Mrs Moussaieff appears unfazed by what she views as trivial bumps in the road \u2014 Brexit, diamond price fluctuations, shifts in buying patterns. What is important, she counsels, is not to become complacent nor rely on the strength of a name.\n\n\u201cI am constantly aware that I\u2019ve got to earn loyalty,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t think, \u2018they won\u2019t go to anyone else because it\u2019s me\u2019. I\u2019ve got to give them value, style. Otherwise, as much as [the client] loves me, [they will] go and love someone else.\u201d\n\nThis is why \u2014 Moussaieff or not \u2014 she remains fixed on Instagram to track what her competitors are doing, in her tireless battle to be the \u201cbest of the best\u201d."

  "text": "Thank you for your help!\n\nWhat was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nFew things better encapsulate watch-buyers\u2019 dilemma of analogue versus digital than the sight of Liverpool football club captain Jordan Henderson at the end of the 2017 season \u201cdouble wristing\u201d \u2014 wearing a smartwatch on one wrist and something more distinctly Premier League on the other.\n\nMechanical-watch fans may appreciate the benefits of a smartwatch but will never completely forsake their traditional timepieces. A recent survey of 1,000 male smartwatch wearers in Britain by online watch brand Code41 found that 88 per cent also regularly wear a traditional analogue watch.\n\n\u201cA smartwatch is never going to have the timelessness or sentimentality of a traditional watch. Smartwatches aren\u2019t a style accessory \u2014 they are simply an extension of our phones, tablets and laptops,\u201d says the brand\u2019s founder, designer Claudio D\u2019Amore.\n\nYet global unit sales for smartwatches reached 18.2m in the last quarter of 2018, according to data from Strategy Analytics, an increase of 56 per cent over the year.\n\nHowever, a clutch of analogue watchmakers has decided that one way to fight the rise of the smartwatch is to build connectivity into classic analogue designs \u2014 the result being a so-called hybrid.\n\nHybrid watches generally combine a quartz movement that drives conventional hour and minute hands around a regular dial, but with a bluetooth-enabled chip that can offer features such as tracking, app notifications, GPS connectivity and the ability to remotely control certain smartphone functions. Fans are happy to sacrifice the functionality of a full-blown smartwatch for the hybrids\u2019 more traditional, elegant aesthetic.\n\nFossil hybrid watch\n\nA growing number of dial names now offer hybrid models, among them the large US brand Fossil, Scandinavians Skagen and Kronaby, and leading smartwatch maker Samsung.\n\nIn October, Fossil signed a global licensing partnership with Japan\u2019s Citizen Watch Company to allow it to use its hybrid technology.\n\nThe aim, said Fossil\u2019s chief executive Kosta Kartsotis, was to enable the group to \u201cbroaden and accelerate the awareness and adoption of hybrid smartwatches\u201d and drive scale in the market.\n\nYet some hybrid makers have been battling other challenges. Swedish manufacturer Kronaby filed for bankruptcy last month after a major investor in the brand\u2019s Malmo-based parent company, Anima, pulled its financing.\n\nWithin weeks, however, Anima was bought by Spanish watchmaking group Festina Lotus. Its president, Miguel Rodriguez, told industry news website WatchPro that the acquisition would enable his firm to \u201ctake a step into the smartwatch segment\u201d and that Kronaby had proved to be \u201cone of the best hybrid smartwatches in the world\u201d.\n\nSkagen hybrid watch\n\nJames Moar of UK-based data analysts Juniper Research agrees that the hybrid sector looks promising and in 2018 accounted for 22 per cent of all smartwatch sales.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want something that\u2019s all-singing and all-dancing, [hybrids] are great and they will probably remain relevant to that certain category of buyer,\u201d Mr Moar says.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason sales haven\u2019t picked-up, however, is the continuing popularity and improving functionality of smartwatches.\u201d\n\nYet he believes that hybrid sales are likely to improve as technological developments bring additional features, so attracting a new wave of tech-minded buyers.\n\nJuniper\u2019s research earlier this year concluded that hybrids would account for more than half of the smartwatch market by 2022.\n\nAmong traditional watchmakers pursuing the hybrid theme is Switzerland-based Frederique Constant, a brand established in 1988 by Dutch businessman Peter Stas and his wife Aletta.\n\nFrederique Constant hybrid watch\n\nFrederique Constant and stablemate brand Alpina launched a \u00a3900 \u201cHorological Smartwatch\u201d at the 2015 Baselworld show. It was the first luxury, analogue watch with a regular quartz movement and bluetooth phone connectivity. Owners could toggle between functions via the crown to display data on a subdial.\n\nThough the couple sold both dial names to Japan\u2019s Citizen Holdings in 2017, they remain majority shareholders in Manufacture Modules Technologies (MMT), a joint venture with Californian tech specialist FullPower that developed the watch\u2019s software.\n\nMMT has to date produced about 200,000 hybrid watches for brands including Mondaine and Ferragamo.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want something that\u2019s all-singing and all-dancing, hybrids are great\n\nFrederique Constant last year returned to the market with another Horological Smartwatch, in the form of the \u00a32,995 Hybrid Manufacture 3.0. It blended classical watchmaking with connectivity by integrating a bespoke electronic module into a traditional mechanical movement, rather than the quartz type usually used in hybrids.\n\n\u201cWe developed an electronic layer that fits unobtrusively beneath the dial, so the watch just looks and feels like a normal automatic,\u201d explains Mr Stas.\n\nThe 3.0 refers to a third function of the device \u2014 the ability of the piece to monitor the accuracy of the mechanical movement and communicate it to the wearer\u2019s phone.\n\nThe model represents around 15 per cent of MMT watch sales by value and Mr Stas believes the market has further potential.\n\nNot everyone agrees. It all comes down to price points, says Jeremy White, executive editor of tech magazine Wired. If, for example, they cost less than \u00a3150, such as those made by Withings, they make sense, he says.\n\n\u201cBut when a traditional watchmaker tries to do the same thing on a more expensive level, it is almost the case that they are cannibalising their own business,\u201d Mr White believes.\n\n\u201cThe portion of the Venn diagram where the person who is interested in the \u2018quantified self\u2019 \u2014 ie activity and sleep measurements \u2014 crosses over with the person who is interested in high-quality horology is absolutely tiny.\u201d"

  "text": "As luxury consumer spending power shifts east, Asian designers are leveraging their heritage to appeal to the region\u2019s growing middle class \u2014 while at the same time attracting new audiences around the globe.\n\n\u201cPeople are seeking something new,\u201d says Korean-American Yoon Ahn, co-founder and creative director of 10-year-old Tokyo-based Ambush, whose designs include slogans and unusual motifs such as crushed cans. \u201cAnd something different that their friends don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nMs Ahn is now head of jewellery design at Dior Homme. She is one of several designers raising their profile outside the Asian market.\n\nThe work of Hong Kong-based designer Michelle Ong, who co-founded the brand Carnet in 1998, is being celebrated in a new book, published in Asia this month, followed by the UK and US in April and June. Ms Ong built a 10-strong workshop of trained craftsmen in the region to create her east-meets-west ethereal designs. \u201cIt has helped me achieve whatever I wanted to because I can realise my vision,\u201d she says.\n\nLast year Taiwanese jeweller Anna Hu became the first contemporary Asian jeweller to exhibit at Moscow Kremlin\u2019s State Historical Museum and have a piece included in its permanent collection \u2014 a China Red Magpie Brooch inspired by an 18th century silk artwork from the Imperial Qing court.\n\nAnna Hu \u00a9 Felix Wong/South China Morning Post via Getty Images\n\nHaving a base in Asia brings its own set of benefits, particularly in an international hub like Hong Kong, says designer Dickson Yewn. \u201cHaving my headquarters here helps from a luxury retail point of view because lots of rich people come here to shop because it\u2019s tax-free \u2014 no sales tax, no VAT, no anything,\u201d says the designer, whose flagship store stands in Hong Kong\u2019s central shopping mall, the Landmark.\n\nThere were more than 30m visitors to Hong Kong in the six months to June, according to the region\u2019s tourist board, 10 per cent higher than the same period in 2017. While most of these came from mainland China, visitor numbers from the US grew 5.8 per cent, while those from Russia and the Gulf states rose 14.6 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively.\n\nDifferences in Asian working culture compared with Europe can bring business advantages. Designer Wendy Yue believes she runs a more effective client service system from Asia. \u201cIn Paris, after 6pm people want to go home. In Hong Kong, if a client has a query we reply right away [even at 11pm],\u201d she says. Being so readily available helps win new clients, she adds. \u201cWith the new generation they want an answer right now, so if you want to be competitive you have to provide an efficient service as they have less patience to close the sale.\u201d\n\nMichelle Ong \u00a9 Paul Yeung/South China Morning Post via Getty Images\n\nSingaporean jeweller and creative director for Swiss jewellery house Boghossian, Edmond Chin, saw his diamond and pearl floral bracelet for Boghossian sell for \u00a33.3m at Christie\u2019s Hong Kong sale in May. Mr Chin, who is also managing director of Etcetera, a brand he founded in 2000, believes his Hong Kong base brings value to his role at Boghossian. \u201cWhen we do bespoke pieces I am able to directly connect with their [Asian] clients,\u201d he says.\n\nYet there are some drawbacks for jewellers based in Asia. Japanese jeweller Yuta Ishihara believes his function-meets-design jewellery line, Shihara, has had a slower international expansion as expensive long-haul travel limits visits and direct communication with overseas stockists and customers.\n\nIt is also more difficult to attract first-time clients, says Ms Ong, because people tend to lean towards the more familiar, globally recognised brands.\n\nPrejudice also remains, Mr Chin believes. \u201cCertain clients in the west and maybe some Asian clients feel that something Hong Kong-made is necessarily lower-quality than something made in Paris or London,\u201d he says.\n\nIn Asia, there is pride in wanting to buy Asian rather than following what comes from the west\n\nChina is the largest jewellery market in the world with sales volumes of more than $100bn compared with about $60bn for the US, according to Statista, the data provider, and Asia\u2019s designers might have an edge in this vast market. \u201cAmong Asian collectors there is pride in wanting to buy something from someone Asian rather than following what comes from the west,\u201d says Mr Chin.\n\nMr Yewn and Mr Ishihara estimate that about a fifth of clients come from the US or Europe, with the number of higher-spending Middle Eastern clients rising. \u201cEuropeans are not buying so much high jewellery today anyway, because it\u2019s not relevant to their lifestyle any more,\u201d Mr Chin adds, pointing to lower spending on wedding jewellery and other family events.\n\nNevertheless, breaking into western markets is still a top priority for many. Mr Yewn plans to open a shop in London in the next five years to complement his shop in Hong Kong because, he says, these are \u201cthe two most strategic locations for people who have money and do business \u2014 even with Brexit going on\u201d. Ambush\u2019s Ms Ahn is planning stores in Shanghai, Hong Kong, New York or Los Angeles in the next three years as \u201cthese are the major cities\u201d.\n\nAsia\u2019s growing pool of world-class designers looks set to become a force to be reckoned with."

  "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\n\u201cThere is a train of thought emerging that being an influencer or blogger is easy, and in the case of fast fashion and affordable beauty, certainly it can be \u2014 all you need is a good camera and a bit of charisma,\u201d says Kathryn Bishop, deputy foresight editor and luxury expert at consultancy The Future Laboratory.\n\n\u201cBut when it comes to high jewellery, precious stones and the portrayal of these beautiful products and heritage brands, it\u2019s not an easy feat.\u201d\n\nIn 2017 there were 21.7m brand-sponsored influencer posts on Instagram alone, according to data collected by agency Mediaklix \u2014 though with undisclosed paid-for posts rife, this figure is likely to be higher in reality. The number is forecast to rise to 32.3m this year, a projection that is likely to soothe those still in the game.\n\nBut scepticism is growing. Bots, fake followers and thinly veiled sponsored posts foster mistrust among social media users.\n\nMarketing consultancy Influencer Intelligence recently polled 500 US and UK adults under the age of 35. It found that for 44 per cent of respondents, whether an influencer\u2019s content is \u201creal\u201d is their number-one concern, while 37 per cent were concerned about phoney followers.\n\nAmid the slide in the sector\u2019s credibility, many influencers are now seeking more stable roles within the jewellery industry and are diversifying to become multi-faceted businesses.\n\nMany bloggers who have studied gemmology or previously worked in the industry are exploring a move away from the influencer label as it loses credibility, Ms Bishop says.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense that they might want to shed this moniker and position themselves as something more professional than a 20-something modelling Asos\u2019s latest \u2018drop\u2019\u201d of new items for sale, she adds.\n\nKaterina Perez \u00a9 Jeff Spicer/Getty Images\n\nOne example is the eponymous founder of KaterinaPerez.com, a site dedicated to high-end jewels. In September, Ms Perez picked up the award for UK Social Influencer at the Jewellery Blog Awards \u2014 though she does not like to be classed as such.\n\n\u201cI call myself a jewellery writer,\u201d insists Ms Perez, who has built an Instagram following of close to a quarter of a million and who has previously worked in retail roles for brands such as Tiffany & Co, Asprey and Chaumet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a certified gemmologist with seven years in my field, my knowledge is deep,\u201d she says.\n\nYet while there is still demand from brands for paid features on her site, a third of her time is now dedicated to other projects. Having built and maintained a strong social media following, Ms Perez recently launched a bimonthly newsletter to advise those within the jewellery trade on how to do the same. She also hosts educational seminars around the world on topics such as social media strategy and photography, and consults with jewellery brands on the creation of marketing content.\n\nOne social media star who is happy to be branded an influencer is Liza Urla, founder of the decade-old jewellery blog Gemologue. She has built a business that stretches beyond paid posts, winning ambassador roles with jewellers. This has enabled her to co-found jewellery-focused creative agency GemKreatives, which counts jewellers Monica Vinader, Daou Jewellery and The Rock Hound as clients.\n\nLiza Urla \u00a9 Julia Flit\n\nBlogging for a living is complicated and \u201ctricky to navigate\u201d, explains Ms Urla, who has just published her first book, Gemologue: Street Jewellery Styles & Styling Tips. \u201c[GemKreatives] helps me to not only rely on the blogging world. I\u2019m very happy to do [paid collaborations on Gemologue], blogging opens other revenue streams to girls like me. It empowers female entrepreneurship,\u201d she says.\n\nSome corners of the luxury sector have been slower to embrace digital than others, but traditional jewellery houses are realising the advantages of influencer collaborations.\n\n\u201cWorking with the right influencer can be a great traffic and brand awareness driver,\u201d says Louise Kahrmann, director of global marketing and communications at luxury jeweller David Morris, which has run several successful campaigns with jewellery influencers.\n\n\u201cWe frequently see clients come in [to our stores] with Instagram screenshots of our jewellery. We recently had an inquiry for a magnificent 30ct white diamond cocktail ring after the client had seen a jewellery influencer post about it, during the recent presentation of our new high jewellery collection at Haute Couture week in Paris.\u201d\n\nThough some of jewellery\u2019s digital tastemakers seem to be shoring up their enterprises by diversifying, not all feel that the influencer business model is on its way out.\n\nTracey Ellison\n\n\u201cUnequivocally, yes, you can make a living [as an influencer] if you are smart about what you\u2019re doing,\u201d says Tracey Ellison, whose passion for gems led her to create TheDiamondsGirl, a Miami-based site that has attracted nearly 615,000 followers on Instagram.\n\nYet while she says she still receives offers daily for paid partnerships, her business plan does not exceed 12 months. \u201cThat\u2019s how quick things change,\u201d she says.\n\nJust in case, Ms Ellison has a back-up plan: she\u2019s working on creating her own jewellery brand."

  "text": "Pocket watch collector Elys Dolan is often patronised by the \u201ctypical old white man\u201d dealers and jewellers she meets. \u201cI think people make an assumption from the fact that I\u2019m a moderately young woman that I haven\u2019t got a bloody clue,\u201d she says.\n\nShe bought her first piece when she was 11, although she kept her interest hidden from friends as a teenager \u201cbecause there would have been no end of trouble\u201d. Now 32, she has about 40 vintage pocket watches to her name.\n\nAs an author and illustrator of children\u2019s books, her habit of carrying one in her pocket, or on a chain round her neck, is a practical one. \u201cBeing in illustration \u2014 and having always been making and doing, or colouring or painting \u2014 anything that you wear on your hands or your wrists is liable to get ruined instantly,\u201d says Ms Dolan, who lectures at the Cambridge School of Art.\n\nShe is interested primarily in the personal history of a watch rather than its maker. \u201cIt\u2019s the knowing that somebody\u2019s owned it before and it\u2019s had a bit of a life,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve never bought a modern watch because they don\u2019t hold the same appeal.\u201d\n\nLadies\u2019 open face Camerer Kuss & Co (late Victorian)\n\nopen-face Camerer Kuss & Co \u00a9 Si Barber for the FT\n\nHer favourite pocket watch \u201cfeels like it\u2019s been through the mill\u201d thanks to the pawnbroker marks scratched on the back, along with horologist marks telling of its service history.\n\nMs Dolan chose the piece, an 18th birthday present from her parents, at a collectors\u2019 fair, pairing it with a gold double Albert chain (which runs from buttonhole to pocket) from the same stall. But the asking price was too high, so her mum had to play \u201ca cunning long game\u201d to get the dealer to accept a lower sum. \u201cI think that was the first moment that I stopped seeing my mother as my mother but as a proper person, a very clever person,\u201d she says.\n\nShe wore the yellow gold watch, which has a \u201cdetailed and lavish\u201d case engraved with a rose and leaf motif, to her graduation ceremony.\n\nLadies\u2019 open-face Waltham (late 1800s)\n\nLadies\u2019 open-face Waltham \u00a9 Si Barber for the FT\n\nAfter Ms Dolan decided that she wanted to mark every major birthday with a watch, her now husband bought her a US-made rose gold Waltham for her 21st.\n\nShe wore the delicate piece, which is about the size of a 10 pence coin, on a chain round her neck for the launch of her first book, 2013\u2019s Weasels. \u201cI sat there the 10 minutes before the doors opened . . . rubbing this watch thinking, \u2018Oh God, I really hope this whole thing works out\u2019,\u201d she says.\n\nLadies\u2019 half hunter (Victorian/Edwardian)\n\nHalf-hunter \u00a9 Si Barber for the FT\n\nBefore Weasels was published, Ms Dolan came second in the 2011 Macmillan Prize for children\u2019s picture book illustration. Then a student, she spent her winnings on a silver half hunter, a pocket watch with a glass panel in the outer casing that allows the wearer to see the hands.\n\n\u201cI did pay my rent that month but I did have to live on beans for a little while afterwards,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it was worth it.\u201d\n\nMen\u2019s open-face James Wadsworth (1903)\n\nOpen-face James Wadsworth \u00a9 Si Barber for the FT\n\nMs Dolan finds a pocket watch more compelling than a wristwatch because it is \u201clike a kit\u201d in that it has accompanying accessories such as a chain, T-bar to attach it to a button hole and a fob.\n\nHer husband wore her silver Wadsworth on their wedding day in 2017 on a silver single Albert graduated chain that she had bought when she was 16.\n\nHer father-in-law gave Ms Dolan the watch shortly before the marriage. It had been presented to his grandfather to mark 27 years of service at John Marston, the manufacturer of the Sunbeam bicycle.\n\n\u201cI was very, very touched to be given this piece of family history to take care of,\u201d says Ms Dolan.\n\nGlass ball watch (1800s)\n\nGlass ball watch \u00a9 Si Barber for the FT\n\nShe was thrilled to find an unusual silver glass ball watch at an antiques fair five years ago. She likes being able to see the mechanism on one half of the piece without having to open it up, and the face on the other.\n\nA silver band is inscribed with a date. \u201cI\u2019ve got no idea what it relates to, nor who owned this watch beforehand, but I really want to know what happened on the 7th September 1893,\u201d says Ms Dolan, who wears the watch on a chain like a necklace. \u201cIt\u2019s like the beginning of a story.\u201d\n\nShe thought she had bagged a bargain. However, giving the \u00a350 watch a quick wind back at her car, the crown came away in her hand and \u201cthe whole thing fell to bits\u201d. \u201cIt had obviously been put together just long enough to sell it,\u201d she says. The dealer, meanwhile, had \u201cdisappeared off into the ether\u201d. She has since had the watch repaired.\n\nShe finds collecting rather addictive, but she will never sell her existing pieces to fund her habit. \u201cI\u2019m far too much of a hoarder to ever let them go,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re suggesting that I sell my children.\u201d"

  "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nNews that the chief executive of Rolex\u2019s watch brand Tudor would be leaving to join Hodinkee, a website for watch enthusiasts, was no run-of-the-mill job move.\n\nThe announcement in February that Russell Kelly would assume the newly created role of chief commercial officer \u2014 and that Hodinkee would open a physical retail store in New York \u2014 is the clearest signal yet that platforms that cross media with commerce are extending their reach.\n\nProprietors speak of the diversification into retail as a way of protecting the prized content side of their businesses.\n\nHodinkee, whose name derives from the Czech word for watch, was founded in 2008 when young financier Ben Clymer lost his job as a result of the unfolding financial crisis. Today, Mr Clymer employs 35 staff and, alongside digital content, has a print magazine and a fast-growing watch sales business.\n\nThe site started selling watch straps and accessories in 2012, and later entered vintage retail. Since 2017 it has been selling current productions and is now an official retailer for 10 brands. Last year the company\u2019s turnover was $15m, according to Mr Clymer.\n\nNow, as chief commercial officer, Mr Kelly has been mandated to open a bricks-and-mortar watch shop and lounge space in a landmark New York venue that will feature a podcast studio alongside watches and merchandise.\n\n\u201cI am excited by the opportunity \u2014 it is something that the industry needs,\u201d says Mr Kelly. \u201cJust as Ben has brought new customers into mechanical Swiss watches, so [too are] young people looking for a new way and place to shop.\n\n\u201cRetailers tell me that the challenge is getting young people into their stores \u2014 we want to create a place that merges content and commerce in a physical space.\u201d\n\nWhile print will remain as an emotional touch point, as publishers we had to evolve\n\nHodinkee is not the only media player becoming seriously involved in watch retail. Singapore-based Wei Koh started the magazine Revolution 14 years ago to indulge his passion for wristwatches.\n\nIn 2009 he launched The Rake, a publication that covers tailoring, bespoke shoemaking and other aspects of contemporary male style, alongside features celebrating the elegance of old Hollywood and the mid-century European jet set. (Full disclosure: I contribute to both titles.)\n\nMr Koh has found an affluent international audience who want, literally, to buy into the lifestyle his publications celebrate.\n\nAs he sees it, expansion into retail was crucial to the ongoing health of his business. \u201cWe saw the writing on the wall regarding traditional print revenue and while print will remain as an emotional touch point, as publishers we had to evolve,\u201d he says. That evolution was turning The Rake into an ecommerce site, which sells everything from ties to vicu\u00f1a dressing gowns priced at \u00a320,000. Watches are a big part of its offering: last year The Rake and Revolution sold $3.5m worth.\n\nHe believes that buyers respond to the authenticity of the limited editions he creates in collaboration with brands: \u201cEvery watch we make is something that I would like to own personally.\u201d So far, he has worked with TAG Heuer, IWC, Chopard LUC and Bell & Ross. \u201cThe TAG Heuer \u2018Blue Dreamer\u2019 and the 36mm IWC pilot in bronze on a reindeer hide strap by Cleverly sold out in minutes,\u201d he says.\n\nHodinkee has experienced similar success. It recently created a limited-edition Omega based on the watch given to Mr Clymer in his teens that ignited his love of watches: the 250 pieces sold out in minutes. Should any of those sales fall through, Hodinkee says there is waiting list of more than 5,000.\n\nOmega watch limited to 250 pieces\n\nAll three sites have different tones of voice, but their legitimacy comes from a fundamental enthusiasm for and knowledge of watchmaking.\n\nWhen asked about potential conflicts of interest, they say they only sell items that they genuinely appreciate, and so therein lies their brand equity. As the watch industry has become larger and more corporate over the past 15-20 years, Hodinkee, Revolution and some other commentators find themselves sitting on a reservoir of years of insight. And now, thanks to social media, they are communicating directly with a savvy and enthusiastic customer base \u2014 one that brands are eager to reach.\n\nAhmed Rahman, a collector of contemporary timepieces, is positive about the content-commerce crossover. \u201cThese collaborative watches bring something interesting to the table that is not in the regular catalogue,\u201d Mr Rahman says.\n\n\u201cIt is often about exploring and amplifying historical aspects; for instance the Hodinkee Vacheron Constantin Cornes de Vache is a cult classic chronograph, and to bring out a steel version that never existed before in a limited number of pieces is attractive to a collector.\u201d\n\nFor the brands, exclusive tie-ins give them an opportunity to stretch themselves in terms of design.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to go beyond what we usually do and develop a design language that is different,\u201d explains IWC chief executive Chris Grainger-Herr. \u201cThe Rake-Revolution pilot\u2019s watch was about contextualisation of lifestyle. Together we developed the concept of the gentleman aviator and it becomes part of storytelling, creating more than a watch. Seeing the watch as part of a curated selection adds more to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a win-win,\u201d agrees Raynald Aeschlimann, chief executive at Omega. \u201cPeople react very well when the two DNAs create something that has even more value. But both parties [must] have shared values as a basis for collaboration and there has to be a real reason: the 10th anniversary of Hodinkee and the fact that Omega inspired Ben to found Hodinkee seemed like a good opportunity to work together.\u201d\n\nThat said, Mr Aeschlimann points out that the five or six limited-edition series Omega issues each year account for \u201cless than 20,000 pieces\u201d out of annual production of about 700,000. In other words, it is not big business and the next challenge for content-commerce platforms is how to scale up.\n\nMr Clymer clearly believes that a physical retail space is the next step, while Mr Koh is exploring the market for high-value collaborations, at six-figure prices, made in small quantities.\n\nAlthough this strand of business is in a nascent phase it is already attracting the attention of investors. Tony Fadell who sold Nest, a maker of smart home products, to Google is among the largest investors in Hodinkee, for instance.\n\nMr Koh, meanwhile, says the business model is in flux and is therefore difficult to put a price tag on. He has already received significant offers, he says, \u201cbut we are not interested in being valued as a print or even digital media company\u201d.\n\nIn the wider luxury industry, where authenticity is the watchword, businesses like his are right to choose their identity and partnerships wisely."

  "text": "Thank you for your help!\n\nWhat was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nBaselworld, the biggest annual watch and jewellery fair globally, has been bedevilled by an identity crisis that peaked last summer when it was forced to review its format after its biggest exhibitor, Swatch Group, announced it was quitting the show.\n\nEfforts since made by the fair\u2019s organisers to overhaul the event \u2014 which had already seen exhibitor numbers fall dramatically between 2017 and 2018 \u2014 will be subjected to intense scrutiny as it kicks off in Switzerland this week.\n\n\u201cThese are not easy times, but we have a lot of good ideas, changes and new concepts,\u201d says Christian J\u00fcrgens, Baselworld\u2019s head of communications. One is an initiative for the fair\u2019s jewellery contingent, which will move to a more prominent location in the venue\u2019s central hall, he adds.\n\nThere will also be a new plaza with big screens and catwalk shows three times a day, Mr J\u00fcrgens says, \u201cwhich will present jewellery with high-end fashion\u201d.\n\nBaselworld has also taken up against price gouging by the host city\u2019s hotels and restaurants \u2014 an oft-cited irritation among exhibitors and visitors over the years. Mr J\u00fcrgens says an agreement has been reached with \u201c40 hotel and restaurant partners, who will not raise prices for the fair\u201d.\n\nA visualisation of Baselworl'd new plaza which will feature video walls and catwalk shows three times a day\n\nBut will a renewed focus on jewellery, fashion shows and commitment by a few dozen restaurants not to pump up their prices be enough to woo back brands and staunch the flow of departures?\n\nThe event\u2019s organisers are framing this year\u2019s event as a transition, during which it will present its \u201cvision\u201d for 2020 and beyond.\n\nBaselworld had been under extreme pressure before last summer\u2019s exodus of brands: exhibitor numbers in 2018 were close to 650, having halved from 2017 \u2014 though the number of visitors remained steady at just over 100,000.\n\nThe exhibitor tally for this year\u2019s event has fallen further still, to about 500. \u201cThis number is smaller than it was in 2018 and certainly lower than we had hoped,\u201d said Baselworld\u2019s managing director Michel Loris-Melikoff in a statement earlier this month.\n\nAttention will focus on Baselworld\u2019s closing press conference, in which the finer details of its grand vision will be unveiled. Yet some brands have already been going their own way.\n\nPrivate equity-owned watchmaker Breitling says is set to make an announcement of its own at the end of the fair.\n\nThe brand promised Baselworld that it would wait until it had fleshed out a new show concept before deciding on its future relationship with the event, says chief executive Georges Kern: \u201cWe will inform [them] after the fair how we will move forward with Basel in 2020.\u201d\n\nBreitling will also hold off-site events \u2014 or what Mr Kern calls summits \u2014 during this year\u2019s Baselworld to unveil its latest products and ideas. The format features a giant screen, \u201ca Steve Jobs Apple-style presentation, and in an hour you\u2019re done\u201d, he explains.\n\nWe will do more business because our people will be in the markets and not at Baselworld\n\nMr Kern has held similar summits in Asia and feels that expanding the format into the US and Europe can dramatically shorten the time to market. \u201cWhatever happens we will go for summits in the future,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are more impactful than small presentations at a booth.\u201d\n\nSwatch Group will be also putting similar ideas to the test this week, as it hosts its own presentations for retailers over in Zurich.\n\nAt a press conference in Switzerland last week, chief executive Nick Hayek explained that the event was conceived in response to \u201cthe wish of the retailers\u201d, who wanted to visit the brand while they were in Basel.\n\n\u201c[Baselworld] has to do without Swatch Group,\u201d he told journalists. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel bad\u201d about not being at the event. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to engage in any kind of show business.\u201d\n\nMr Hayek added: \u201cWe will do more business because our people will be in the markets and not at Baselworld.\u201d\n\nBrian Duffy, the chief executive of multibrand retailer Watches of Switzerland, says he is excited to see what \u201cthe rocks of Basel\u201d \u2014 Patek Philippe and Rolex \u2014 will be showing.\n\n\u201cOver the last three or four years it is phenomenal what Rolex and Patek have done in terms of market leadership,\u201d he believes.\n\nHowever, he feels that Swatch\u2019s absence from the fair will leave a big hole. \u201cWe always look forward to the watch fair. I am a little sad about not seeing a huge presentation from Omega and the other Swatch brands,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cDoes it indicate a permanent downsizing [of the fair] overall? We will see,\u201d Mr Duffy adds.\n\nAs Baselworld unfurls its grand plan for next year, its organisers will perhaps hope the congregation takes the view that size isn\u2019t everything.\n\nAdditional reporting by Maxine Kelly\n\nFace to face: fair\u2019s top launches By Simon de Burton 1. Breitling Bentley Centenary Edition This year British automotive marque Bentley celebrates its centenary with this new chronograph featuring a burr elm dial based on the veneers used for the dashboards and door cappings of its cars.

  "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nAs opening gambits go, St\u00e9phane Bianchi\u2019s is one of the more guarded. \u201cI say no to most interviews,\u201d begins the head of the LVMH watches division, which includes TAG Heuer, Hublot and Zenith.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything about strategy because we\u2019re working on it \u2014 and anyway, I don\u2019t want to be too precise because it only benefits competitors.\u201d\n\nIf that remains his position, Mr Bianchi will cut a very different figure from his predecessor, with whom inevitably he will be compared. In November, the mild-mannered Frenchman took over from industry veteran Jean-Claude Biver, a vocal character known throughout the industry for his candour and showmanship. Mr Biver, who had been suffering from ill health, has since moved into a non-executive role in the division.\n\nDressed in a modest blue suit and white shirt, Mr Bianchi looks comfortable in the plush surroundings of Geneva\u2019s Kempinski Hotel. While he might come across as more reserved than his predecessor, he appears no less determined.\n\n\u201cI have never looked at the man, I\u2019ve looked at the job,\u201d he says when asked about following in Mr Biver\u2019s footsteps.\n\n\u201c[He] is very famous, but I\u2019ve taken over from many great men and founders, and I\u2019ve never looked at myself taking over from someone else. I\u2019m taking over a brand. It\u2019s completely different.\u201d\n\nIndustry observers viewed Mr Bianchi\u2019s appointment as left field.\n\nI\u2019m not here just to manage things as they are. I\u2019m here to grow our brands\n\nHe arrived aged 54, with no watch industry experience, typically a prerequisite when taking the reins at the biggest names in watchmaking. His perspective is that he likes \u201cworking with family-owned companies \u2014 even if that company is huge\u201d. LVMH describes itself as a \u201cfamily-run group\u201d, with more than 150,000 employees.\n\nMr Bianchi has form here. In 1994, after a stint with now-defunct accounting firm Arthur Andersen, he joined family-run French cosmetics group Yves Rocher, becoming its chief executive three years later, aged 33. He was tasked by Mr Rocher, the founder who died in 2009, with buying back shares that he had sold in the early 1970s, after he was told by doctors \u2014 wrongly as it transpired \u2014 that he was dying, according to Mr Bianchi.\n\nAt the end of 2012, he says, he had delivered the brief. \u201cThat was a good time for me to leave,\u201d he adds \u2014 though the family convinced him to stay another three years.\n\n\u201cI wanted to buy my own company,\u201d he explains. \u201cTo be alone without anyone looking over my shoulder.\u201d By his own admission, it didn\u2019t work out. \u201cThis was a failure because I did not succeed,\u201d is his simple summary. \u201cI could not find a very good brand, a brand I could fall in love with and for a good price.\u201d\n\nSo in 2016, he joined the board of Maus Fr\u00e8res, a family-owned Swiss conglomerate that operates sportswear and outdoor brands Lacoste, Gant and Aigle, among others \u2014 a position he has retained since joining LVMH.\n\nHe had met Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive of LVMH, informally a few years before he was approached by him last year to take over from Mr Biver.\n\nLVMH \u2014 whose other subsidiaries include Louis Vuitton, Dior and Bulgari \u2014 says its watches division contributed \u20ac4.1bn to group sales of \u20ac46.9bn in 2018. \u201cThis division might [be able to] occupy a bigger place within the group, but that\u2019s a real challenge because this is a fashion group,\u201d Mr Bianchi says.\n\nWhile he holds back on details of the division\u2019s current performance, he says growth is \u201cnot far off being in line\u201d with 2018 export figures reported by the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry, which grew 6.3 per cent year on year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here just to manage things as they are,\u201d he insists. \u201cI\u2019m here to grow our brands and the division as well.\u201d\n\nAlongside his role leading the division, Mr Bianchi, who lives in London with his family, has also become chief executive of TAG Heuer, which is based in the Swiss town of La Chaux-de-Fonds.\n\nHe is a longtime watch collector and is enjoying getting under the skin of the division\u2019s three brands, he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been working with brands for years and I need to understand them before launching a strategy,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI need to feel them. For me, with brands it\u2019s 50 per cent head and 50 per cent guts.\u201d\n\nTAG Heuer has the highest revenues in the portfolio, he says. He describes its price positioning as \u201cperfect\u201d and the \u201centry to luxury\u201d. Hublot has the strongest presence of the three in China, he notes, while Zenith and TAG Heuer have \u201chuge work to do\u201d in the Asian market. He believes Zenith, the smallest of the three brands, \u201cdeserves to be much bigger than it is now\u201d.\n\nMr Bianchi admits he still harbours an ambition to have his own company. \u201cYes, it does remain, but now I want to build something within the division,\u201d he says.\n\nStill, that comes with its own risks. \u201cI\u2019m not paid to establish something wrong,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m paid to succeed.\u201d"

  "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nJewellery houses are upping their game in the unceasing battle to boost their visibility in online searches for engagement rings \u2014 the most searched-for jewellery term.\n\nThe rewards on offer are huge. The highly competitive bridal segment accounts for 27 per cent of diamond sales by value across the US, China and Japan, according to De Beers \u2014 a combined market worth $58bn.\n\nFor many prospective spouses, an engagement ring will be their first ever \u2014 and sometimes only \u2014 meaningful jewellery purchase (a wedding ring too, if the proposal goes well).\n\nThe average price of an engagement ring in the US is more than $6,000, according to The Knot, a wedding planning website. The UK figure is closer to \u00a31,500, according to insurer Aviva.\n\nFew wannabe fianc\u00e9s would commit to spending such an amount without first researching the basics. Search engines are often the first port of call for those hunting for the perfect ring to seal the deal, making the likes of Google and Bing battlegrounds on which jewellers fight for eyeballs.\n\nBlue Nile engagement ring\n\nThe term \u201cengagement ring\u201d tops the list of 700 of the most searched jewellery terms online, according to a 2018 study by L2Inc (now Gartner), a data provider. And according to The Knot\u2019s study, 90 per cent of US buyers use mobile devices for wedding-related tasks such as buying a ring. Consumers search for an average of 3.5 months and look at 26 potential rings.\n\nTo climb up the rankings, jewellery houses strategically invest in things like search engine optimisation (SEO) and auction-style bids for advertising slots, to be positioned among Google\u2019s paid-for results for highly searched terms. Coveted search terms cannot be bought by just anyone, however. The search engine\u2019s auction system emphasises the relevance of that organisation to certain words or phrases.\n\nOptimisation aims to make a website easy to find, explains Edward Cowell, partner, SEO and performance content manager of MediaCom, a communications agency. \u201cImproving technical performance, such as load speed, the organisation of the content, structure of the website, and the choice and location of words within the pages\u201d also make a site easier to use and more likely to rank higher in search, he adds.\n\nBulgari engagement ring\n\nGoogle\u2019s latest algorithm, rolled out last summer, gives precedence to websites that are quick to load and easy to navigate on mobile devices, where the majority of searches now take place. \u201cWhen companies invest in making their web pages faster and more user-friendly, this better serves our users,\u201d a Google spokesperson says.\n\nRelevance is key, and search results change according to a user\u2019s location. A buyer in New York searching for engagement rings, for example, will be shown paid-for advertisements, followed by a list of retailers available in the city.\n\nThese ads are becoming more prolific \u2014 more than 60 per cent of all global watches and jewellery search results are now paid for, according to Gartner data \u2014 making it harder for brands to gain prominence in search results organically.\n\nSEO is a \u201ccentral part\u201d of the strategy of US-based online jewellery retailer Blue Nile, which launched in 2000. Jon Sainsbury, chief strategy officer, says his site commands an \u201capproximately 4 per cent share of the highly fragmented US diamond engagement ring market\u201d.\n\nBlue Nile\u2019s content \u2014 which includes consumer guides about jewellery and precious stones \u2014 is peppered with popular search terms, designed to resonate well with search engines\u2019 algorithms.\n\nTiffany engagement ring\n\nBigger jewellery houses fare well with branded keywords and phrases like \u201cBulgari engagement ring\u201d, but they receive less than 1 per cent of visibility for the generic term \u201cengagement ring\u201d. The only exception is Tiffany & Co, which is \u201cvisible for 22 per cent of unbranded jewellery search keywords and it is the only luxury brand able to compete head-to-head with a site like Blue Nile\u201d, according to Brian Lee, senior principal at Gartner.\n\nJewellery\u2019s best digital performers, such as Tiffany, Cartier and Bulgari have also invested in the creation of content for YouTube \u2014 the video sharing site owned by Google \u2014 to draw customers\u2019 attention to their bridal collections. This further boosts traction online, says MediaCom\u2019s Mr Cowell.\n\nThe average global conversion rate for online sales hovers at 2-5 per cent, says Tobias Kormind, managing director of 77diamonds.com. \u201cWe convert less than 1 per cent of our visitors,\u201d he says, adding that marketing further up the \u201cdecision-making funnel\u201d \u2014 that is, improving its showing in search results \u2014 is crucial to improving performance.\n\nJewellers know that to sell engagement rings, they have to start courting customers online wherever their search begins."

  "title": "Luxe boho fashion for spring",
  "authors": [],
  "text": "The notion of the beautifully dressed bohemian can be traced back to the muses of the mid-19th-century\u2019s pre-Raphaelites, who loved to pose for portraits in garments inspired by classical art. Their sartorial style, later known as Aesthetic Dress, favoured clothing with simple lines but in richly coloured and expensive fabrics. Loose rather than constricting, the clothes fell with the natural form and movement of the body \u2013 conducive to both good health and freedom of self-expression.\n\nThere are unmistakable echoes of ultra-luxe bohemian fashion emerging this season. Many designers are using the word \u201cfreedom\u201d in reference to their collections, while presenting refined versions of a loose, artistic style of dress \u2013 chic pieces imbued with a spirit of global travel and incorporating sophisticated craft-fabric techniques.\n\nFor Chlo\u00e9 and Paco Rabanne, it has been a chance to play with late-\u201960s/early-\u201970s counterculture and notions of an escape to the exotic, and to elevate the familiar tropes of the flower child \u2013 fluid goddess dresses and pyjama or harem trousers, luxurious fabrics with handcraft treatments, dangling jewellery and sandals \u2013 into an elegant ready-to-wear wardrobe. Chlo\u00e9\u2019s Natacha Ramsay-Levi summoned up \u201ca new age revival\u201d in a collection she described as \u201chippy modernism\u201d. Patchwork and paisley silk shirts (from \u00a31,700), fluid ankle-length skirts or harem trousers (both from \u00a31,130) and dresses (\u00a32,565) were caught by twisted silk lariat belts (\u00a3565) and accompanied by flowing trench coats (\u00a31,890) or slim calf-length ribbed cardigans (price on request).\n\nPaco Rabanne\u2019s creative director Julien Dossena, meanwhile, presented \u201ca melting pot of decorative arts\u2026 with a sense of mystic escape\u201d, and opened his Paris show with a standout wallpaper-print floral silk slipdress with handkerchief hem (\u00a31,125). Paisley-print ankle-length dresses (from \u00a3560), gathered at the waist, were a slinkier option, with lavish layers of gold pendants (from \u00a3170) and chic sandals (price on request).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElizabeth von der Goltz, global buying director at Net\u2011a-Porter, feels that the expressiveness and creativity associated with the hippy or global traveller is being taken to a new realm. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just for the eclectic dresser \u2013 it feels considered and it\u2019s appealing to more women,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are seeing a breadth of designers taking it on in their own way, from cool and relaxed at Paco Rabanne to evening-appropriate styles at Oscar de la Renta.\u201d\n\nInspired by co-designer Laura Kim\u2019s trip to Marrakech, New York-based Oscar de la Renta put patchwork scarf prints on swishy, fringed, sarong-style wrap skirts (\u00a31,470) and softly constructed shirting (from \u00a3876). Alongside a lightweight one-shouldered silk kaftan (\u00a31,640), the house also deployed outsized ikat patterning on an elegantly waisted organza summer dress (\u00a35,750), a sophisticated silk bustier (\u00a31,910), and supremely chic wide-leg black and cream trousers (\u00a31,210) worn with a tailored, embroidered blazer with a woven and fringed hem (\u00a35,750) and rope belt (\u00a3750) \u2013 making beautiful use of the artisanal-craft trend in a season where resist\u2011dyeing techniques are prominent.\n\nThe hippy\u2019s favourite, tie-dye, is the most eye-catching, popular \u2013 and perhaps surprising \u2013 of these this season, and it\u2019s been elevated from the domain of T-shirts and beach sarongs to silk dresses and skirts. Contrary to its laidback associations, this treatment is adding sophistication wherever it goes, says von der Goltz. \u201cOur customer is always looking for something special, and batik and tie-dye fabrics quickly communicate that handcrafted aspect,\u201d she says.\n\nWhile Stella McCartney\u2019s blue acid-washed organic-cotton boiler-suit (\u00a3895) may be de trop for some, women looking to capture a little of their inner bohemian in a restrained setting could wear one of her toned-down tie-dye T-shirts (\u00a3240). And look to Prada: vivid swashes of colour on tie-dyed satin skirts (\u00a32,970) lend something rebellious and artistic to daywear. Paul Smith also embraced handcraft, including a burnt-sienna, handkerchief-hem silk dress (\u00a3630), a mid-length black cotton coat (\u00a3995) with a pattern that looks like psychedelic fireworks, and a linen drawstring bag (\u00a3200) with crochet circles. \u201cElements of the collection are quite tie-dye in their appearance, but it\u2019s actually ikat weaving, which gives a dispersed and misty impression,\u201d says Smith. The rich palette was inspired by the colour in photos taken by the designer and his father, a keen amateur photographer. \u201cThey\u2019ve naturally discoloured over time, which I like, but also we didn\u2019t want them to look too sharp or perfect,\u201d says Smith. \u201cIt\u2019s a reaction against the computer-generated images we\u2019re inundated with every day.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s at Dior that tie\u2011dye has been taken to couture-grade heights, executed to stunning effect using the house\u2019s petites mains\u2019 unrivalled technique. It emerged on the runway in the form of a dark-red and grey tie-dyed cotton trench coat (\u00a35,700) and matching silk midi skirt (\u00a36,300), worn with a grey d\u00e9grad\u00e9 knit (\u00a31,500), the tie-dye distorting an original Dior flower print that is stronger on various garments, including elegant loose harem trousers (\u00a32,050) in inky blues \u2013 worn with a neat belted jacket (\u00a32,900) \u2013 and a sensational mid-length waisted dress (\u00a322,000) with an asymmetric shoulder effect. Creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri saw the craft as one that could express best the dynamism of her inspiration \u2013 the movement of the pioneering American dancer Loie Fuller. The tie-dye was her attempt to \u201creproduce what for me is a kaleidoscope of rhythms and movements and translate the expressive power of dance into fantastical colours\u201d.\n\nThe friction between elegant ready-to-wear and such a haphazard craft held multiple attractions, she says. \u201cTie-dye is a technique that comes out of total experimentation and the desire for absolute freedom \u2013 and from a certain faith in chance,\u201d she says. \u201cIt originated outside formal fashion circles, is uncontrollable and expresses a strong political sentiment. Including it allowed me to modulate different moods \u2013 the rebellious, joyful culture of the 1970s with a degree of the elegance that Dior stands for.\u201d For Grazia Chiuri, this rather homey craft became a challenge of chance effects versus perfection. \u201cIt meant going against the precision of the techniques typical of the studio,\u201d she says. \u201cThe petites mains worked on trying to control the results, but it\u2019s precisely the inherent unpredictability that makes the whole thing extraordinary.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKassia St Clair, author of The Golden Thread: How Fabric Changed History, says Dior\u2019s treatment of tie-dye is a fascinating counterpoint for the technique. \u201cThey must have put an incredible amount of effort in to get those results,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s going against the grain of tie-dye and the clothing it generally lends itself to. But that\u2019s what makes it new. Designers are turning to techniques that add something unique to their garments.\u201d\n\nThey are also no doubt fuelled by the success of resortwear labels whose collections are often infused with a bohemian mood, such as LoveShackFancy, founded by American stylist Rebecca Hessel Cohen and embodying what she calls a \u201cluxe gypsy sensibility\u201d. It is inspired by the Victorian and Edwardian eras and by travel to the Bahamas, The Hamptons and Provence. The (mostly) dresses, in broderie anglaise and silk georgette (from $275), evoke a floaty romanticism perfect for a summer wedding or garden party \u2013 but Hessel Cohen maintains that the escapist mindset runs year-round. \u201cEven if it\u2019s freezing, you\u2019ll find me in a cascading dress, styled with a cosy knit sweater and layers,\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s about how you wear the pieces and the sensibility behind them.\u201d For some, boho luxe is a way of life, not just a summer fling \u2013 and it\u2019s a more attractive prospect than ever.\n\n445"

  "authors": [
    "Produced Tom Hannen. Charts John Burn-Murdoch"
  ],
  "text": "You're looking at a bar chart race showing which cities had the largest populations at any time over history. We're going to start the race at 1500 A.D. In the early 1500s most people lived in the east, either the east of Europe and North Africa, or the east of the world itself in India and China-- two countries that would be a regular occurring feature as we get on.\n\nAs that century went on, Beijing went from being the largest city in the world to being encroached upon by Istanbul, which then took the lead around 1600. India and China again dominating here, but note how Paris, London, and Naples joined the ranks as other major European cities.\n\nAs the 1600s continue, note Tokyo rising up there into 2nd place. At this stage, Western Europe, India, and China are dominant but things are about to change. In the later 1700s the Industrial Revolution took hold. London, who is already among the top 3 cities in the world, but just wait to see what happens next. Keep an eye on that horizontal axis over the next few seconds.\n\nLondon here is still under a million people. But as the 18th century turned into the 19th, it shot forward over a million. Look at that axis stretching out as London soars up hitting two million before 1850, and then racing on towards 3. All other cities pretty much left in the dust now.\n\nAnother thing to watch now is the North American cities come along. That continent was barely populated at the start of our time period. As we move into the 20th century, we have three North American cities and almost all the rest of European. But watch for our old friend Tokyo shooting up to the rankings again.\n\nAfter the 2nd World War, Tokyo's population is around 10 million. But look at that now. It's doubled to 20 million within only about another 20 years, and then soon hits 30. The thing to note in the last 30 years of the period is those European cities in North American cities falling out of the ranks, and it's the emerging markets dominating with Asia, India, and Latin America.\n\nThe eagle eyed among you may have noted one city vanish, dropping from 2nd to third in the top 10, right out of this series altogether. That was in 1565 when the Indian city of Vijayanagara was conquered in a military conquest and then procedurally burned to the ground over a period of months. Pretty much nothing was left, and today only ruins survive.\n\nI'm, John Burn-Murdoch and I make data visualisations at the Financial Times. This chart was made using JavaScript, using the coding platform Observable. All the data I used to make the chart, and the code to create your own, can be found at the link on screen. But let me know on Twitter if you have any comments or questions about this video itself, or if you've made anything similar using the data."

  "title": "Prices rise in The Hague even as housing stock expands",
  "authors": [],
  "text": "By Alex Howlett\n\nThe counts of Holland, who ruled the country in the Middle Ages, were attracted to The Hague because of its vast forests. Today, housebuyers are flocking to \u201cThe Count\u2019s Hedge\u201d, as it is known, drawn by new developments in the city centre.\n\nMedian house prices across the Netherlands rose 11.8 per cent between 2017 and 2018; in Amsterdam they grew 16.3 per cent to \u20ac425,200, and in The Hague by 19 per cent to \u20ac280,000, according to the NVM, the Dutch association of estate agents.\n\nHouse prices in The Hague were up 19 per cent between 2017 and 2018\n\nThe Hague, the Netherlands\u2019 third-largest city, lies 50km south-west of Amsterdam on the North Sea coast. It has proved more able than the capital to respond to a rise in demand for housing, amid a nationwide shortage, with new supply. The Hague is expanding as developers create new neighbourhoods in former industrial areas and around the central railway station, largely made up of apartments for young professionals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s urbanisation but also gentrification,\u201d says Bas Wilberts, a director at Savills Netherlands, the estate agent. \u201cThere is a preference to live close to the facilities, the restaurants.\u201d\n\nNew residential properties at the central station development\n\nAs a result, buyers \u2014 many of whom have been priced out of Amsterdam \u2014 increasingly are considering The Hague. Home to the government, the UN International Court of Justice and Noordeinde Palace (King Willem-Alexander\u2019s \u201cworking palace\u201d), the city is expected to grow in population by 17.3 per cent between 2018 and 2040, compared with a 6 per cent rise nationally, according to the NVM.\n\nCost is not the only driver, however: the number of tourists visiting Amsterdam has more than doubled since 2011. \u201cMany Dutch people don\u2019t want to live in the city any more because it has become too crowded,\u201d says Tjerk van der Linden, managing director at Engel & V\u00f6lkers, the estate agent.\n\nExpats are investing more in The Hague\u2019s residential market. A report from NVM in April 2018 found that expats accounted for 40-50 per cent of house viewings between the first quarter of 2017 and first quarter of 2018. Kate Everett-Allen, head of international residential research at estate agent Knight Frank, says expats \u201cmay want to act now\u201d as house prices continue to rise, and that buyers from US in particular could enjoy some exchange-rate advantage if they do so.\n\nThe International Criminal Court, one of the city\u2019s many international employers\n\nVan der Linden says The Hague is one of the most popular places for expats to live in the Netherlands, probably because of the international employers based in the city, such as the International Criminal Court and Unicef Netherlands. Data provider Global Property Guide has found that about a quarter of jobs in The Hague are with either international organisations or the government.\n\nBeing close to other Dutch cities, including Rotterdam, Utrecht and Amsterdam, The Hague might be affected by the movement of organisations to the country from the UK as a result of Brexit, leading to an increase in foreign buyers and putting further pressure on the residential market. The European Medicines Agency, for example, has already relocated from London to Amsterdam.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency new Amsterdam headquarters under construction\n\nVan der Linden thinks house prices in The Hague will rise further. \u201c[The increase] started in Amsterdam a few years ago, and will continue to develop for a few more years in The Hague,\u201d he says.\n\nBecause of its coastal setting, he describes The Hague as \u201cthe Barcelona of the Netherlands\u201d \u2014 which is perhaps a bit of a stretch.\n\nThe Grand Hotel Amr\u00e2th Kurhaus in The Hague\u2019s seaside district of Scheveningen\n\nPhotographs: Getty Images/iStockphoto; Dreamstime"

  "title": "Expat identities: why the French feel at home in Hong Kong",
  "authors": [],
  "text": "By Nicola Nightingale\n\nLiving in a foreign country raises all kinds of questions, both practical and emotional: how do you define yourself and how are you characterised by your adopted homeland? This series relates, in alternating parts, the experiences of a British woman in Hong Kong and a French woman in the UK.\n\nWhen Karine Zanini, a French citizen, arrived in Hong Kong in October 1993 armed with a sense of adventure, a backpack and enough money to last two weeks, she was a rarity in the city.\n\nOf course, the then 23-year-old was not the only young, foreign free spirit in town \u2014 there were, she says, \u201ca lot of English\u201d \u2014 but there were so few French people that her new-found friends called her \u201cexotic\u201d.\n\nToday, Hong Kong is the top destination for French people who want to live and work in Asia, according to the French Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Both the chamber and the consulate-general of France in Hong Kong and Macau estimate there are at least 25,000 French citizens living in the city.\n\nThat might sound like a mere handful in London, where there are between 300,000 and 400,000 French expats, but it is a significant number in Hong Kong. Here, 92 per cent of the 7.4m-strong population is Chinese and 4 per cent of the remainder are domestic helpers, mostly from the Philippines and Indonesia.\n\nThe rising profile of France in Hong Kong includes restaurants\n\nThe Hong Kong Immigration Department has a different view on the number of French people in the city. It says the most accurate way to count heads is to tick off the number of people physically present on a particular day, because some with residential status may have wandered off, never to return.\n\nAt the end of December 2009, the department says, there were 2,375 French nationals in Hong Kong; at the end of January 2019, there were 6,534. Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department figures show 2,539 for 2006 and 8,060 for 2016.\n\nBoth sets of figures differ significantly from those of the consulate and chamber of commerce, which are the most widely quoted, but they still show a big increase. It raises the question: why are French people moving to Hong Kong?\n\nZanini, who worked for a travel agency for eight years before becoming a freelance French teacher, believes the latest arrivals feel much as she did about Hong Kong when she landed 25 years ago \u2014 that it is a place of infinite possibility. \u201cI thought, at worst, I will spend two weeks here, but by the third day, I found I enjoyed it,\u201d she says. \u201cI still have the same enthusiasm for Hong Kong, the same sense of freedom. You can become a different person here; you can become who you want to be.\n\nKarine Zanini says \u2018you can become who you want to be\u2019 in Hong Kong\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something about French culture \u2014 the need to put you into one box. I was convinced there was a different way to live. Hong Kong made it possible.\u201d\n\nHer excitement was obviously infectious since her brother, sister-in-law and brother\u2019s friend and best man joined her not long after she settled in.\n\nToday, she says, there are French people of all ages and professions in Hong Kong, nearly all of whom share her appetite for adventure and freedom, she says.\n\nMarine Sanz Vico certainly does. The 30-year-old French art director and graphic designer describes herself as a \u201ca really driven and independent person, always on the lookout for adventure\u201d.\n\nThat quest, plus a fascination with cultural difference, led her to work for design agencies in many countries, including the US, Argentina and mainland China. She visited Hong Kong for the first time while she was working in Shanghai and was smitten by Lamma, one of its outlying islands.\n\nShe quit Shanghai, moved to Lamma and tried her luck as a designer in Hong Kong. A year ago she started her own business, Bold Design.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be able to have a big-city life for its dynamism and opportunities while also being able to enjoy a more relaxed environment, closer to nature,\u201d she says. \u201cHong Kong seemed to be the perfect place for me to find that balance.\u201d\n\nMarine Sanz Vico likes Hong Kong\u2019s balance of big-city life and nature\n\nDoubtless there are French citizens in Hong Kong for more pragmatic reasons, namely work. The French Chamber of Commerce says there are now 750 French companies or French group subsidiaries in Hong Kong.\n\nThe city is showing signs of the French influence: there are French restaurants everywhere and the long-established private practice OT&P Healthcare recently appointed a French liaison officer.\n\nThe growing French connection \u2014 and mutual affection \u2014 is underlined by Le French May, an arts and cultural extravaganza that opened with a few events in 1993, the year Zanini arrived, and is now one of the largest annual cultural events in Asia.\n\nJulien-Lo\u00efc Garin, its chief executive for eight years, says Hong Kong\u2019s fast-expanding French population does not mark an exodus caused by the lack of jobs at home but initiatives such as Le Volontariat International en Entreprise, a French government programme that assists young people up to the age of 28 to work for French companies abroad for between six and 24 months.\n\nHe also says the flurry of large infrastructure projects in Hong Kong, such as new railway and bridge connections to mainland China, has boosted business for French companies such as construction group Dragages in recent years.\n\nThe Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge: French company Dragages was involved in its construction\n\nBut while France\u2019s cultural and commercial presence in Hong Kong is considerable and its expat community is the fastest-growing, according to the Hong Kong government, it is by no means the biggest. The US Department of State estimates there are 85,000 US citizens living in Hong Kong, while the British consulate-general in Hong Kong claims 300,000 citizens \u2014 a figure that covers \u201cthe wider group of British citizen passport holders in Hong Kong, which includes some individuals of Hong Kong origin residing in Hong Kong\u201d.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Immigration Department, meanwhile, says there were 18,540 UK nationals present in Hong Kong at the end of January 2019 and 25,495 US citizens. These figures include all expats with smart ID cards who have entered or exited the city using port or airport automated gates or e-channels.\n\nWith such varying figures, perhaps Zanini has the best way to measure the influence of France on Hong Kong. When she arrived there was hardly any French produce available but now, she says, \u201cI can find all the French cheese I want.\u201d\n\nYou can read more articles from our Expat identities series here\n\nPhotographs: Dreamstime; Getty Images; Bloomberg"

  "title": "Craig Green\u2019s perfect weekend in London",
  "authors": [],
  "text": "\u201cI live in Colindale, north London, near to where I grew up because that\u2019s where my old friends are. It\u2019s my escape from the frenetic fashion world. It\u2019s just at the edge of the city so it has many parks and a real village feel. Everyone at the pub knows your name, just as they\u2019ve known your family for generations. My local is the Greyhound in Church End, where my dad still goes.\n\nI rise early and start Saturday mornings with a large cup of cold milk infused with coffee. I use instant; it sounds awful, but it tastes incredible. It\u2019s a habit I picked up from my partner, Angelos, and it\u2019s the perfect start to the day. I admit I spend part of the weekend working, but I love what I do, and it comes with the territory of having an independent business.\n\nWhen I\u2019m not in the studio, I might walk on Hampstead Heath, but for culture I\u2019ll head for the Hayward Gallery in the Southbank Centre. I\u2019m a fan of brutalist architecture and dream of showing a collection there one day. I also love the Barbican and the Whitechapel Gallery for their brilliant programming.\n\nI\u2019ll often have lunch with friends in Sunny Hill Park, near home. I love the Middle Eastern-inspired food at Sunny Hill Caf\u00e9, especially the falafel. But the Serpentine is always an adventure, so on a nice day I might walk through Hyde Park and have lunch at the caf\u00e9 there.\n\nI\u2019m always interested by Machine-A, a Soho boutique that showcases a lot of young London-based designers; it\u2019s often the first store to stock their collections, making for an interesting mix of experimental up-and-coming independent labels alongside more established brands.\n\nWhenever I am in central London I seem to end up in Selfridges. I used to go with my parents as a kid and there are always exciting things happening in the store \u2013 especially on the fashion floors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack in north London, Kiplings Tandoori has been our family go-to for years \u2013 but Jun Ming Xuan in Colindale is a newer favourite: it\u2019s possibly the best Chinese restaurant in London. They serve dim sum by day, but in the evening it becomes a white-tablecloth kind of place with dishes such as grilled chicken dumplings and pork ribs.\n\nI might then head to the Everyman Cinema in Hampstead. I love the disaster and horror genres and I\u2019m obsessed with zombie films like Sleepwalkers by Stephen King. Even if I\u2019m home early, I stay up late watching these movies, much to Angelos\u2019 chagrin: he\u2019s more of a Woody Allen type.\n\nOn Sunday mornings I\u2019ll have something a light breakfast, then do a bit of shopping. Dover Street Market in Mayfair is incredible for design inspiration, even if I\u2019m not buying. I have a sweet tooth and the Rose Bakery there is amazing: I always opt for cakes that look rustic and homemade versus faux fancy.\n\nIf the weather is good, I might make for the Towpath Caf\u00e9 on Regent\u2019s Canal \u2013 it\u2019s great for people-watching and they serve excellent sandwiches. The De Beauvoir Arms in north London is another favourite. Their chorizo with red wine is so good we talk about it in the studio all week.\n\nThe day usually winds down at my mum\u2019s house where we gather for a roast. Everyone hangs in the garden and I\u2019ll escape home at around 8pm to just listen to music or read. I used to look forward to leaving town at the weekends, but now my week is such a whirlwind and I travel so much, being home is the ultimate luxury.\u201d\n\n444"

  "authors": [],
  "text": "In terms of workwear, The Gannet\u2019s needs are simple. A proper jacket is the main requirement: smart enough to pass muster with the Michelin mob, sturdy enough to withstand the rigours of a gourmand\u2019s life (robust buttons are obligatory), and with plenty of pockets to stash pens, reading glasses, a notebook, a vintage chart and tiny bottles of Tabasco, in case a dish errs on the bland side.\n\nSuch a jacket is made by Universal Works, the men\u2019s clothing company with emporia in Soho, Bloomsbury and now Coal Drops Yard; it also has a shop in Nottingham. The company\u2019s designer and co-founder is David Keyte, whose tailoring captures a workwear aesthetic of which my Bakers jacket is the perfect example: Keyte\u2019s father was a member of that noble profession.\n\nUniversal Works\u2019 head office, in Nottingham, is but a mile or so from Restaurant Sat Bains, the two-Michelin-starred fiefdom of one of Britain\u2019s most highly regarded chefs. In celebration of chefs, bakers and tailors, my jacket and I went there for lunch, taking a table in Nucleus, Bains\u2019 development kitchen.\n\nMy lunch was tailored as precisely as my jacket. We were invited up to the counter for the first five dishes, each encapsulating one of the \u201cfive flavours\u201d. Yeast crackers dusted with green tea and beetroot powders represented salt; umami came dressed as a steamed bun filled with XO sauce; carrots cooked with liquorice and scattered with sherbet were unimpeachably sour; while red cabbage ice cream with raspberry vinegar (sweet) and shiitake mushrooms with chocolate (bitter) took care of the others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese, it transpired, were the building blocks for the rest of the meal, the menu colour-coded to illustrate which flavours predominate in each dish. If all this sounds more like a science class than a good lunch, rest assured: didacticism was kept to a minimum and nothing was less than thoroughly delicious.\n\nOf the five flavours, umami punched well above its weight: a dish of smoked eel, for instance, with thin discs of turnip and a shimmering dashi jelly, had a rich, almost bacon-like savour; an ember-baked potato was stuffed with caviar and sauced with kombu, cream cheese and chives; while \u201cSherwood Forest\u201d was a delightful tangle of venison tartare, c\u00e8ps, tiny cro\u00fbtons, cocoa powder and a smoked oak-infused mayonnaise, mushroom ketchup and pine-spruce vinegar. I could hear the crunch of autumn leaves as I devoured it. There was mallard, too, the breast tender and flavoursome, the rest made into an offal-rich sausage roll, soy sauce spiking the gravy: none of which, mercifully, found its way onto my jacket.\n\nBains combines modern techniques with a Japanese approach to flavour. The techniques he employs are often complex, but the resulting dishes have a beguiling simplicity: he and David Keyte, I suspect, are cut from the same cloth.\n\n444"

  "text": "For a decade in the 1980s, England was the No2 chess nation after the old USSR. There were Olympiad medals aplenty, and Nigel Short challenged for Garry Kasparov\u2019s global crown. Then the Berlin Wall fell, and new ex-Soviet nations emerged along with India and China. Gold at the 1997 European teams seemed England\u2019s final success.\n\nThen, last week at the world teams in Astana, Kazakhstan, the 22-year drought ended as England won team silver behind Russian gold, while Luke McShane (gold), Gawain Jones (silver) and David Howell (bronze) won individual board medals. The City of London can be proud of McShane, who combines careers as a grandmaster and a financial trader.\n\nThe event was organised at short notice, and less than a month before the start England had no sponsor and no team to take on the well financed Russians, Chinese, Indians and Americans. Success was due to good team strategy, halving with the strong and defeating the weak, good opening prep, and resilient recoveries from mid-session difficulties.\n\n2307\n\nNi Hua v Aleksandr Lenderman, China v United States, world teams, Astana 2019. This position led to a surprise defeat for China and gave England its silver opportunity. Since 1 Qh6 or Qh5 loses a knight to the pawn fork e5-e4, 1 Qe4 was expected, but instead White gave up a piece by Nxg5 and lost on material. Can you spot the hidden trap Black had prepared against 1 Qe4?\n\nClick here for solution"

  "text": "This vast urban area\u2019s wealth of districts and culture allow anyone to find their niche\n\nBy Antonia Cundy\n\nMexico\u2019s capital \u2014 the oldest capital city in the Americas \u2014 sprawls over some 1,500 square kilometres, 2,240 metres above sea level. Voted the number one travel destination for 2019 by National Geographic, the city has an economic strength, cultural traditions and access to the natural world that are good reasons to move here permanently.\n\nDesign destination\n\nOriginally built on an island by Aztecs, the city was the political, administrative and economic centre of the Spanish empire in the Americas. Today, Mexico City has a mix of Aztec, Mayan and European heritage that has created an exciting range of architectural design \u2014 from the pyramids at Teotihuac\u00e1n just north-east of the city to 16th-century Catedral Metropolitana and the modernist murals of Diego Rivera.\n\nAttractions such as the artist Frida Kahlo\u2019s Blue House, now a museum, and the strikingly modern Museo Soumaya appeal to designers across the world, so much so that the city was designated the World Design Capital in 2018.\n\nThe Frida Kahlo Museum, housed in the artist\u2019s family home\n\nInternationally reputed food and drink\n\nTraditional Mexican food is one of the few global cuisines to have been declared an \u201cintangible cultural heritage\u201d by Unesco. In Mexico City it is impossible not to eat well \u2014 street-food stalls are famed for their tostadas (small toasted tortillas topped with various ingredients), carnitas (little mouthfuls of slow-braised meat) and tubs of fresh mango with chilli.\n\nAt local taquer\u00edas you are free to pile as many salsas and salads on to soft corn tacos as you can manage. Mexican chocolate is so good that it is even used in savoury mole sauces (traditional chilli sauces).\n\nThen there are the drinks: aguas frescas (fresh fruit waters) by day and tequila, mescal (the spirit of choice among the health conscious) and carajillos (espresso with brandy) by night. Try the tipples at local cantinas \u2014 Covadonga in the Roma borough and Cantina T\u00edo Pepe in Centro both have loyal followings.\n\nPork carnitas tacos, one of Mexico\u2019s street-food staples\n\nStrengthening economy\n\nThe IMF predicts Mexico\u2019s economy will grow 2.1 per cent in 2019, following similar growth in 2017 and 2018. Mexico City\u2019s business district, Santa Fe, hosts the majority of the country\u2019s financial services headquarters. The city is also a centre for other industries, such as textiles, steel and iron.\n\nThe luxury goods and service sectors are booming. In 2016, across the country they were valued at $3.56bn \u2014 a 55 per cent increase from 2011, according to Euromonitor International. Deloitte last year described Mexico as \u201cthe most attractive market for luxury brands in Latin America\u201d.\n\nMexico City\u2019s Santa Fe business district\n\nCultural traditions for all\n\nA diverse range of traditions are celebrated in Mexico over 13 public holidays each year, and the capital\u2019s residents go all out. The D\u00eda de Muertos (Day of the Dead) parades in the autumn and lucha libre (wrestling) matches are cause for enormously colourful parties.\n\nOn a match day, the atmosphere at the Estadio Azteca \u2014 the home of Club Am\u00e9rica and Mexico\u2019s national football team \u2014 is infectious. With a capacity of 87,000, the arena is one of only two stadiums in the world that has hosted two World Cup finals.\n\nWith 16 boroughs \u2014 from the artsy student quarter, Ciudad Universitaria (literally \u201cUniversity City\u201d), to the hipster-posh Condesa, or the dance and food-focused Roma with its famous Mama Rumba salsa club \u2014 there is room for everyone to find their niche.\n\nA D\u00eda de Muertos parade, one of the city\u2019s most famous traditions\n\nWildlife on your doorstep\n\nIt is unexpectedly easy to find nature in the dense urban environment of Mexico City. The canals of Xochimilco \u2014 explore them in a colourful hired wooden boat \u2014 cover 170 square kilometres. You might even spot a rare axolotl, a near-extinct four-legged salamander.\n\nElsewhere, at 686 hectares, the Bosque de Chapultepec is one of the largest city parks in the western hemisphere and home to many of the 60-plus species of hummingbird that live in Mexico City.\n\nFurther afield, there are beaches, pine forests, rainforests, deserts and grottos. The snowy volcano at the Nevado de Toluca national park, or the millions of monarch butterflies at the Piedra Herrada Sanctuary are two highlights within two hours of the city centre.\n\nIn a region that gets between 11 and 13 hours of daylight a day, with year-round average temperatures of 23C-27C, these natural delights are easily accessible.\n\nThe Nevado de Toluca volcano national park, about 80km from Mexico City\n\nPhotographs: Dreamstime; Getty Images/500px; Getty Images/iStockphoto; Suriel Ramzal; Marek Poplawski"

  "authors": [
    "Sarah Gordon",
    "Foreign Aid",
    "Sexual Misconduct Allegations"
  ],
  "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nThe future of Oxfam, one of the UK\u2019s most venerable philanthropic institutions, remains in the balance following the revelations last year of sexual misconduct by its aid workers in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti.\n\nSalacious details of Oxfam aid workers using prostitutes in Haiti were made worse when it emerged that the charity had been aware of the misconduct by 2011 but failed to acknowledge it publicly, allowing the country director responsible, Roland van Hauwermeiren, to resign and go on to work for other charities.\n\nRebuilding the organisation\u2019s reputation and restoring public trust in its work as it awaits the findings of an independent investigation by the Charity Commission is the challenge facing Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah, Oxfam\u2019s new chief executive, who described the Haiti scandal as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Oxfam of tomorrow is going to be unrecognisable,\u201d vowed Mr Sriskandarajah, who took over in January.\n\n\u201cPeople are so busy saving lives or responding to emergencies, that I think they ended up not paying sufficient attention to the behaviours or cultures that were driving some of this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be doing good around the world while colleagues are causing harm along the way.\u201d\n\nComing in the wake of the #MeToo movement, the Haiti revelations caused outrage among Oxfam\u2019s donors and the general public. Mr Sriskandarajah\u2019s predecessor, Mark Goldring, further fuelled criticism when he told the Guardian newspaper that the reaction had been \u201cout of proportion\u201d.\n\nThis was followed by allegations of sexual harassment at Save the Children, sending a shockwave through the entire voluntary sector. Parliament\u2019s international development select committee described the aid sector\u2019s response to sexual offences by charity workers as \u201ccomplacency verging on complicity\u201d. Donations slumped.\n\nRoland van Hauwermeiren, Oxfam director for Haiti, went on to work for other charities after the charity had been made aware of the misconduct\n\nMr Sriskandarajah, a former civil society activist, was appointed because he would \u201cask the difficult questions and work well with colleagues across the Oxfam confederation to come up with the answers\u201d, according to Caroline Thomson, Oxfam\u2019s chair, who described him as a \u201cbrilliant strategic thinker with a record of delivery\u201d.\n\nHe previously worked at Civicus, a Johannesburg-based global alliance of civil society organisations that works to strengthen citizen action. Before that he was director-general of the Royal Commonwealth Society and has been deputy director of the left-leaning think-tank the Institute for Public Policy Research. He is also a trustee of Comic Relief.\n\nOxfam is currently the subject of two investigations \u2014 an internal one into sexual misconduct, accountability and culture change, as well as the one by the Charity Commission. Until the latter reports, the charity will not bid for UK government contracts.\n\nThe impact on the organisation\u2019s funding could be severe. Institutional donors provided \u00a3209m of Oxfam GB\u2019s \u00a3427m income in the 2017-18 financial year; around \u00a322m came from the UK government. When its last annual report was published late last year, Oxfam said it was unable to quantify the impact of the scandal on individuals\u2019 donations but 7,000 supporters stopped giving in the immediate aftermath, and Mr Sriskandarajah says \u00a314m of income has been lost.\n\nThe charity has shed 120 jobs \u2014 from a UK workforce of 1,150 \u2014 in response to the drop in funding, but now believes donations have stabilised, albeit at a lower level than before. Mr Sriskandarajah himself will earn \u00a310,000 a year less than Mr Goldring, at \u00a3120,000.\n\nA latrine project led by Oxfam in Port-au-Prince, Haiti \u00a9 Jonathan Torgovnik/Getty Images\n\nMr Sriskandarajah believes important steps have already been taken to address the failures of leadership and culture that led to the wrongdoing in Haiti.\n\n\u201cThe care and approach being taken to how we deal with safeguarding will be a step change,\u201d he said. \u201cJust in the last year every single member of staff has gone through training on safeguarding.\u201d\n\nThe charity is following a 10-point action plan, which includes strengthening internal processes, and strengthening its \u201cfocus on gender justice externally\u201d. Mr Sriskandarajah believes there is a genuine appetite for reform within the organisation.\n\n\u201cPeople are working tirelessly to try to get things right, because it goes to the heart of our mission . . . Every colleague I\u2019ve spoken to internally sees the need for change, not just in terms of the internal culture, but also about how we do programmes, how we deploy globally.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that Oxfam was implementing organisational change before the scandal broke, with a new international model under which Oxfam affiliates work together under a single management structure in each country, rather than having a number of different country directors.\n\nBut critics say changes are needed across the entire sector. In July British MPs argued that aid charities should be subject to a new ombudsman to end years of \u201cabject failure\u201d in tackling sexual abuse.\n\nMr Sriskandarajah said he believes a global system for vetting aid workers, which is currently being trialled, is necessary, despite fears that such a register would be overly bureaucratic.\n\n\u201cWe have to get much more serious. If ever there was a platform and a moment to reimagine, repurpose, this is it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the sector must better manage the endemic power imbalance between aid donors and recipients, which was undoubtedly a factor in Haiti.\n\nIn 2017 he wrote a blog asking whether the charity sector was at \u201cthe beginning of the end\u201d, and argued that the \u201ccorporatisation\u201d of big charities had set business \u201cfree to pursue private good almost at all costs\u201d.\n\nHe now says that no charity \u201chas the right to exist indefinitely\u201d, but believes the world needs a \u201cstrong, independent, vocal\u201d civil society more than ever, and that Oxfam\u2019s record of providing humanitarian relief whilst also challenging policy justifies its future.\n\nHe is aware of the difficult task ahead and admits that he had to \u201cthink twice\u201d before deciding to join Oxfam, but a friend\u2019s comment swayed his decision.\n\n\u201cHe said something that haunted me for the next few days . . . [that] real leaders run into the fire and not away from the fire.\u201d"

  "title": "Pierpaolo Piccioli \u2013 why Valentino is stealing all the headlines",
  "authors": [],
  "text": "Ask anyone in the world of fashion to nominate their recent favourite industry moments, and the odds are Pierpaolo Piccioli was the architect behind them. The elegant designer stole all the headlines at couture week last summer, when he presented the model Kaia Gerber wearing a giant confection of pastel-pink marabou and super-volumised bouffant hair. Two months before, he escorted Frances McDormand, resplendent in an aquamarine cape and a feathery headdress recalling a halo of butterflies, to the Met Gala. Earlier this year, he dressed Lady Gaga, magnetic and majestic in a showstopping periwinkle ballgown that was custom-dyed to match her hair, for the Golden Globes. She may not have won all the awards, but she stole the show.\n\nIn an industry driven by sales figures and costs per unit, Piccioli\u2019s designs are a haven for fashion purists. Not that his designs aren\u2019t commercial; they are. But they have a sense of exuberance and joy about them that seems to recall another, altogether more wonderful, era. Born in Nettuno, a coastal town just outside Rome, in 1967, Piccioli has always lived and worked near his birthplace. He studied fashion design at Rome\u2019s Istituto Europeo di Design in the 1980s, and it was in the city that he met Maria Grazia Chiuri, a fellow Roman designer with whom he was appointed, in 1990, to work at Fendi. He joined Valentino in 1999, crossing Rome with Chiuri to work on shoes and accessories under the brand\u2019s charismatic founder Valentino Clemente Ludovico Garavani. Following a short interregnum period after Garavani\u2019s retirement, the pair were appointed creative co-directors of the house in 2008. They transformed its profits with their clever commercial focus \u2013 the spring/summer 2011 introduction of a superstar accessory, the Rockstud shoe, in particular helped drive brand revenues beyond the \u20ac1bn mark.\n\nPiccioli was made the sole creative director in 2016 following Chiuri\u2019s move to Dior womenswear. But it was only last year that his solo vision for the house seemed to take flight. His womenswear shows garnered unanimous critical praise and brought audiences to their feet. Most satisfying of all, the spring/summer 2019 collection, shown last September, found the designer evoking the mastery, skill and precision of the couture atelier on which the house was founded in 1960, and translating it into ready-to-wear. His voluminous black summer gowns with knife-edged pleating (from \u00a31,890), crisp cotton shirt dresses (from \u00a31,890) and velvet jacquard pyjama suits (tops from \u00a33,450, trousers from \u00a34,500), decorated in Persian-carpet patterns and in kaleidoscopic colours, elicited a rapturous response. That he had an exceptional year was confirmed in December when he was anointed The Fashion Awards\u2019 International Designer of the Year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very in my shoes,\u201d says Piccioli, of his feelings towards the house that has been his creative home for two decades. He is wearing his customary uniform of black trousers and T-shirt, over which he throws a long black overcoat when the temperature requires. His deep tan face, slight features and neat moustache lend him a slightly melancholy expression \u2013 he might be Steve Buscemi\u2019s chicer Italian cousin \u2013 although when he smiles, which he does often, his whole demeanour changes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe are meeting not at the maison\u2019s headquarters but in a rather arid business complex in Ginza, Tokyo, where the Valentino team has taken up residence to prepare for a pre-fall show presenting designs that will go on sale in April. The jet lag and the intensity of the schedule are only slight inconveniences for the designer, who has perched an espresso beside him. As anyone who works around him will attest, his energy levels are immense. \u201cI think I\u2019m very aware of myself and that I\u2019m managing such a great company,\u201d continues Piccioli, of the position he now finds himself in.\n\nWith such a long period of experience at the label before assuming sole creative control, he felt no need to effect any major change when Chiuri left. Nevertheless, these last years of independence have allowed him to spread his wings. \u201cMy way of working is different maybe,\u201d he reflects. \u201cWhen you work together, you have to share your thoughts, and sharing thoughts means everything must have a reason; the process becomes more academic and everything is more structured. Now, things float more between thoughts and emotions: if I feel something and I feel it\u2019s good, I go for it, even if I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019ve definitely become more instinctive as a designer. The process is more free, more fluid.\u201d\n\nCertainly, the great success of Piccioli\u2019s ready-to-wear collection for this season was found in its sublime simplicity. \u201cIt was absolutely beautiful, a standout of the season,\u201d says Natalie Kingham, fashion buying director at Matchesfashion.com. \u201cIt really encapsulated the couture mood we saw coming through [in ready-to-wear].\u201d Kingham was quick to buy in many of the collection\u2019s more rigorous designs: in particular a black cotton dress with a structural silhouette (from \u00a33,450), a pristine white shirt dress with a scarf-neck detail and gently pleated skirt (\u00a31,890), a white cotton blouse with large bell-sleeves and a round neck (\u00a31,590) and another white shirt with exaggerated proportions (\u00a31,000).\n\n\u201cPierpaolo understands what confident women want to wear today, from the flat shoes that allow you to run round effortlessly to his cleverly cut dresses that are long and voluminous, or shorter and colourful. We think it\u2019ll really resonate with our customers,\u201d says Kingham, who also seized upon the Escape sandals (\u00a3575), which have a detachable strap that fastens to the heel like a feathery fender. \u201cThe head-to-toe separates in one colour felt modern and polished. The jewellery, in matte gold, was super-clean and sculptural to complement the clothing. Every look was desirable and it felt very empowering.\u201d\n\nMaria Milano, head of womenswear at Harrods, was equally enamoured. \u201cI felt Valentino\u2019s spring/summer 2019 runway show was the highlight of the season,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was so elevated and chic, but without being fussy. Pierpaolo put black back on the fashion agenda, and the caped gowns (complete with pockets), micro-pleated dresses, raffia bags and feathered sandals will perform very well.\u201d\n\nAccording to Milano, Piccioli\u2019s solo collections were a \u201csmash hit\u201d from the outset. \u201cThey strike just the right balance between being demure and fashion forward,\u201d she says. \u201cThe long-sleeved gowns and the saturated colours \u2013 particularly red and pink \u2013 will be a big pull factor [for our clients]. Valentino is an important business for us across the board and a solid performer.\u201d\n\nThe brand\u2019s Tokyo trip coincided with the opening of a pop-up Valentino store, selling everything from the maison\u2019s own womenswear, menswear and accessories to locally sourced artisanal products, branded phone holders and limited edition collaborations with Japanese labels, such as the popular streetwear brand Undercover. Walking around the store provides a clear insight into the demands on a modern creative director, and the need, within an ever-fluctuating global economy, to develop a range of products that will satisfy a spectrum of Valentino women.\n\n\u201cJapan has always fascinated me, because it has a different kind of beauty,\u201d says Piccioli, reflecting on the tastes of his clients. \u201cThe western idea of beauty comes from a Greek tradition of perfection, harmony and symmetry. The Japanese idea is more intimate: it\u2019s not about physical attributes, it\u2019s about innate grace and the romantic gestures, transience and beauty of imperfection. That technique, kintsugi [where cracks in pottery are repaired with gold lacquer, highlighting the value of its faults], is interesting to me because it suggests that time adds something to beauty. In the west we tend to look for surface perfection \u2013 so I find this idea very romantic.\u201d\n\nIn a luxury world that now does much of its business with millennials, Piccioli\u2019s appreciation for a more mature definition of beauty might sound counterintuitive. Doesn\u2019t he have to focus his efforts on youth and its passion for streetwear? \u201cI don\u2019t think about millennials, not really. You can\u2019t target them; that\u2019s a marketing operation and I don\u2019t do marketing, I do fashion. I want to deliver values through clothes. You have to look for emotional connections with your collections, otherwise it\u2019s just about surfaces. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough.\u201d\n\nThat said, Piccioli has been keen to recast Valentino. Under Garavani, the couture house embodied a very singular definition of luxury. One of the great challenges that Piccioli has had to address is how to transpose the values of couture and make them work for today. \u201cYears ago, Valentino was about lifestyle, no? The idea of dreams and castles and private jets. But I hate the word lifestyle; it\u2019s an old word. Today, I think lifestyle is more about communities: you love the same car, the same kind of furniture, the same type of books. You share values. I want to get Valentino away from the exclusive world of castles and into a world that\u2019s deeper. I don\u2019t want a beautiful, dusty brand. I want something that is alive.\u201d\n\nBut how do you share values at a modern luxury fashion house whose clients are based all over the world, and whose tastes may differ widely? \u201cI think it has to be personal. You have to be closer to people,\u201d says the designer. \u201cI hate the word exclusivity.\u201d\n\nOn the catwalk, Piccioli does still conjure a dreamy kind of aesthetic, evoking fashion at its most extravagant and delirious. But he baulks at this suggestion. \u201cI don\u2019t want to present the dream,\u201d he says. \u201cI want it to be a kind of streetwear \u2013 but not in the western sense, where streetwear is a sweatshirt. This is about rethinking an old Valentino dress from the red carpet, but using its ruffles on a trench coat and making it in nylon.\u201d\n\nIn essence, he translates the grandeur of haute couture by rethinking the designs in more quotidian materials. Instead of silk taffeta, for example, he might use more accessible cotton or nylon. \u201cIt\u2019s not basic,\u201d he says, motioning towards a tunic dress covered in tiny fabric petals. \u201cIt\u2019s a real dress. The techniques echo the culture of the house, but the clothes are for everyday: a trench, a shirt, a tunic. I think the risk at this moment is doing something that is generic. But this is not generic, because you\u2019re keeping the Valentino codes in the details. You retain the romanticism of the pieces, but in a different way.\u201d\n\nRomance is a word that creeps often into conversation with Piccioli. And his clothes are deeply, unashamedly so. His exquisite colour palette \u2013 with its blush-rose pinks, turquoises and carmines \u2013 might have been mixed by Michelangelo. It\u2019s this exuberance that makes his clothes so arresting\u2026 The sorbet shades and silhouettes cause even the harshest of critics to melt. The clothes are emphatically feminine without appearing too girly; sensual but not sexual. They grab attention and make women look positively regal. When I borrowed a white one-shouldered dress for an awards ceremony, I was struck that, despite the puritan rigour of its silhouette, it was phenomenally easy to wear. A master example of the goddess gown, it also made me feel divine.\n\nPiccioli has an instinctive understanding of designs that flatter. Since becoming the sole creative director at Valentino, his silhouette has become kinder and more relaxed as well: the waists are lower and less princessy, and he has placed a focus on layering that allows for more coverage, if so desired. Of the summer collection arriving in stores, most of the pieces have long sleeves, and almost all are long length themselves. Of course, some of the designs have sheer lace panels and frou-frou feather embellishments, but Piccioli\u2019s work shows a respect for women\u2019s bodies that is often lacking elsewhere.\n\nIf he has identified a shift among his female clients, it is found in their attitude. His clothes are meant for people on the move. At the spring/summer 2019 show, models pacing the catwalk in the aforementioned flats, their clothes billowing behind them, looked dynamic and confident. \u201cI never imagine clothes as still,\u201d says Piccioli. \u201cEverything is always moving.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe has even embraced the most modern of fashion trends, the logo \u2013 which this season stars as 1970s-style hardware on thick leather belts (\u00a3630) and smart bags (V-Ring, \u00a32,100). He was tentative early on about using such visible branding. \u201cI\u2019m part of the generation that maybe felt the logo was too close to the commercial pieces I didn\u2019t like. I didn\u2019t think of it as fashion,\u201d he says. His mind was changed when he noticed the younger members of his design team wearing branded pieces from the \u201970s they had bought on vintage sites. After all, if modern luxury brands are all about shared values and community, he shrugs, the logo is a pretty effective way of becoming part of the club. \u201cThe logo today is more about being part of the same gang. It shouldn\u2019t mean, \u2018This is an expensive object\u2019; it should express the essence of the brand. I\u2019ll use it in daywear, for T-shirts, for sweatshirts \u2013 but it depends how I feel.\u201d\n\nIn 2016-17, Piccioli delivered seven per cent growth for the house, which is owned by Mayhoola for Investments, the fund overseen by Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser al-Missned, mother of the Emir of Qatar. Women\u2019s accessories account for 50 per cent of all sales, and in recent years Piccioli has been haunted by the phenomenal success of the Rockstud, which saw Valentino sales more than double in the five years following its launch. \u201cWhen the Rockstud was introduced, it revolutionised the shoe market and made the kitten heel cool again,\u201d says Milano at Harrods.\n\nCan that lightning strike twice? Piccioli is sanguine about the commercial pressures he faces. \u201cI\u2019m not a very strategic person \u2013 and it\u2019s not because I don\u2019t want to stay in safe territory. I like to be free to do whatever I feel.\u201d He\u2019s wary of becoming too enslaved by the bottom line, or too bogged down by the industry. \u201cI\u2019m doing the job of my dreams, for sure. But I have a life, and the job is part of it. I have friends. I have a family. I have a wife, kids. My job is not the only thing.\u201d\n\nPiccioli manages his ego by engaging closely with people, both outside the office and in the design team. \u201cOf course, at the end, you\u2019re alone. And sometimes it\u2019s difficult to communicate your ideas about Japanese iconography, or how you want to do an embroidery \u2013 but it is much more interesting, and more intimate, to involve others in your creative process. I also think that sometimes you need to work on something you don\u2019t like, or you didn\u2019t used to like, because it takes you away from safe territory. I work with young people, in their 20s, so I appreciate that they think differently. Filtering something with a new sensibility is good. It\u2019s interesting to be out of your comfort zone, and to experiment not only with the techniques, but with your mind.\u201d\n\nPiccioli\u2019s mind is vivid with ideas right now. The past year has thrust him on a trajectory that few designers ever experience. And his work has been wonderful. Long may the experiments \u2013 and the dialogue \u2013 continue.\n\n445"

  "text": "Thank you for your help!\n\nWhat was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nA century after the Spanish flu pandemic killed 50m people \u2014 more than those who died on the battlefields of the first world war \u2014 policymakers are still struggling to find better ways to tackle the virus.\n\nThe World Health Organization this week launched a new influenza strategy up till 2030, stoking a debate that has been simmering since the last pandemic a decade ago.\n\nFor all the concerns about Ebola and new emerging infections such as Mers and Sars, old-fashioned flu \u2014 in new and constantly mutating forms \u2014 continues to impose a heavy burden. There are an estimated 1bn cases a year, 3m \u2014 5m of which are severe, and some 300,000-600,000 deaths.\n\nAs the WHO report points out, globalisation, urbanisation and mobility risk accelerating the spread of the next pandemic, as do factors including factory farming and international trade in fowl which harbour avian viruses that can mutate and put humans at risk.\n\nThe need to identify the most widespread flu strains each year and produce vaccines by archaic methods in response remains cumbersome. Improved drugs and diagnostics are needed \u2014 not least to avoid the misuse of antibiotics, driving fresh drug resistance.\n\nFor now, centuries-old prevention techniques including handwashing and avoiding crowds while infected remain essential complements to new treatment technologies.\n\nRegister here to receive FT Health by email free each week\n\nThree questions\n\n\n\nKevin Watkins, head of Save the Children, a charity which is campaigning to increase efforts to tackle pneumonia, with a summit in early 2020.\n\nWhy are you so concerned about pneumonia?\n\nIt\u2019s the biggest neglected disease, the biggest killer of children, causing nearly 1m deaths each year. Existing interventions could save so many more lives. But it\u2019s not hit the donors\u2019 radar because it affects the poorest. That\u2019s an appalling failure of UN agencies and charities like ours. We need to get it on the agenda or we will never reach the 2030 goal of zero preventable deaths.\n\nWhat needs to be done?\n\nEvery high-burden country should have an action plan to identify those most at risk. We need to radically scale up diagnostics and the provision of antibiotics, and to strengthen referral to ensure patients have access to low-cost oxygen. Pneumococcal vaccine would have a big impact but it is the most expensive product bought by Gavi (the global vaccines alliance), which only funds it for low income countries. It also needs to be more widely used in middle-income countries like India.\n\nWhat do you think of the current criticism of international aid?\n\nThe UK is one of the richest nations in the world. The idea that it can\u2019t afford to play a leadership role diminishes us as a country. We should be telling the truth about what aid can do: not exaggerated claims but real evidence for the public, and providing a platform for the children who benefit so they can tell their own stories. Dfid (the UK aid agency) is more accountable and produces more evidence than almost any other [UK] ministry.\n\nChartwatch\n\nVenezuelan health emergency The terrible state of public health in Venezuela, ravaged by political and economic crises, has seen for half a decade now big jumps in infant and maternal deaths and outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Blackouts have also hit supplies of drinking water. (The Lancet, Reuters)\n\nNews round-up\n\nAmerica first President Trump's US budget proposals included more money to fight HIV at home \u2014 albeit much less than needed \u2014 but also cuts in overseas programmes such as The Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria and Pepfar, the HIV/Aids initiative. (NYT, Devex, Washington Post, Vox)\n\nFDA chief Ned Sharpless, director of the US National Cancer Initiative, was named acting head of the Food and Drug Administration. Tobacco stocks fell as investors bet the FDA would continue former head Scott Gottlieb's strong stance against the industry. The regulator announced new restrictions on the sale of flavoured ecigarettes. (FT, NYT)\n\nFood for thought The world's dietary habits are heading in the wrong direction, according to an FT report on the future of food: while 1bn people go hungry, twice that number eat too much of the wrong stuff. The WHO published new tools to monitor the digital marketing of unhealthy products to children. Food standards are also becoming a key Brexit issue. (FT, Stat, WHO, The Lancet)\n\nHIV hopes Despite last week's optimism about \u201ccuring HIV,\u201d the largest ever prevention study showed the fight may be harder than anticipated. (FT Big Read, Science)\n\nChemical hazards The $5tn global chemical industry was responsible for 1.6m preventable deaths and 45m disability-adjusted life years in 2016. The sector is set to double in size by 2030, posing new challenges to contain leakages and stop them entering the food chain. (UN Global Chemicals Outlook)\n\nThe selling of sleep World Sleep Day aimed to \u201craise awareness of sleep as a human privilege often compromised by the habits of modern life,\u201d but the idea that we should all aspire to a single unbroken block of sleep is a recent invention, says one author, who suggests we become aware of \u201cnew sleep hygiene and the agendas that it carries\u201d. (WSD, Guardian)\n\nLife on the frontline \u201cWhen people leave their home in the morning, they don't know if they'll be back in the evening.\u201d The BBC spent a week with an ambulance crew in Kabul, the Afghan capital and one of the most dangerous cities in the world. (BBC)\n\nGenetics and ethics Developers of Crispr, the genetic editing tool, were among those calling for a moratorium on editing human genes following the Chinese \u201cdesigner babies\u201d furore. A new documentary charts the history of Crispr, \u201cthe most important scientific discovery of the 21st century\u201d. (Nature, FT, Wonder Collaborative)\n\nWidening the gene pool The $2.7bn Human Genome Project has been referred to as \u201can operating manual for Homo sapiens,\u201d but its overwhelmingly white European base means people from different backgrounds will not benefit from the genetic revolution. (Stat)\n\n\n\nVaccination education Unvaccinated children are now banned from Italian schools after a damaging row about compulsory vaccinations which led to measles cases shooting up. The New York Times opinion section has found a fun way of getting the message across. (BBC, NYT)\n\nBest from the journals\n\nC-section alert Maternal deaths following caesarean births in Africa may be 50 times higher than in richer countries, highlighting the need for improved procedures. Deaths of babies born via C-section were double the global average. (The Lancet Public Health)\n\nFake drugs 'pandemic' The cost to the world economy of falsified or substandard medicines is up $200bn and is associated with thousands of deaths \u2014 especially in poorer countries \u2014 and increasing antimicrobial resistance. Fake anti-malaria drugs alone kill 155,000 children each year. (American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene)\n\nChoking to death Deaths from air pollution in Europe could be as high as 790,000 a year \u2014 double previous estimates. Total deaths worldwide could be 8.8m rather than the previous estimate of 4.5m, or more than the total number due to smoking. English authorities want to discourage drivers of highly polluting vehicles entering populated areas. A US study found black and Hispanic Americans suffered unduly from air pollution caused by white American consumption.\n\nA separate report from the UN said environmental damage could kill millions by 2050 if action was not taken. (European Heart Journal, FT, Environmental Pollution, PNAS, Reuters)\n\nVulnerable adolescents The global population of people aged 10-24 is now the biggest in history at more than 1.8bn. These adolescents face growing inequalities when it comes to health risks. (The Lancet)\n\nNot so sweet Many of the big children\u2019s drink brands were once owned by tobacco companies. Here\u2019s how they developed techniques to market these sugary drinks to children. (BMJ)\n\nDemocratic dividend Democratic rule appears to be a more important indicator of human health than a country's wealth. Life expectancy in countries that moved to democracy between 1970 and 2015 increased by 3 per cent compared with those that remained autocracies. (The Lancet)\n\nTo boldly go . . . (NEJM) Space medicine has hitherto been the concern of governments and their career astronauts, but as the age of private space travel draws near, this will widen to cater for a much more diverse group.\n\nPodcast of the week\n\nCan a better understanding of our genetic make-up help us eat better? Darren Dodd and Clive Cookson, FT Science Editor, discuss developments with neuroscientist Miguel Toribio- Mateas. (FT, 12 mins)\n\nFT event\n\nThe FT Digital Surgery Summit in San Francisco on March 21 will examine how next-generation surgical technologies are transforming performance in the operating room.

  "text": "[SPEAKING CHINESE]\n\nChina's annual impression of democracy, the National People's Congress, has come to an end. Often called the rubber stamp parliament, the NPC welcomes delegates from across China to come to Beijing and debate policy.\n\nFor an international audience this year's top of the agenda is a new law to help foreign investors. The new rule bans technology transfer and makes it illegal for government officials to meddle in the operations of overseas companies.\n\n[SPEAKING CHINESE]\n\nOn the surface, it's a massive change of tack for the Chinese government, which traditionally has dangled access to its vast market as a way to get companies to share technology and know how. As well as pleasing business, the measure is aimed at President Donald Trump and his team of US negotiators. China is desperate to end the yearlong trade war with the US. And it hopes the new law will go a long way to reassuring American investors about its sincerity.\n\nBusiness Chiefs used to be China's greatest allies in Washington. But their support has waned in the face of increasing competition, and the sense that they are being squeezed out of markets in China and overseas in favour of Chinese rivals, many of whom have been using their technology.\n\nEven so, the foreign business community isn't completely happy. They worry that they could still be sabotaged by the detailed regulations. In short, the devil's in the details.\n\nForeigners aren't the only ones with complaints. Private Chinese companies feel that they are at a disadvantage to their state owned brothers, while state companies complain that they have to prop up local economies, even when it isn't profitable. The foreign investment law may help address some complaints, but Beijing still faces an uphill battle to keep both foreign and its domestic investors on board."

Clearly, what has happened here is an extraordinary and unprecedented act of violence.\n\nMany of those who will have been directly affected by this shooting may be migrants to New Zealand. They may even be refugees here. They have chosen to make New Zealand their home, and it is their home. They are us.\n\nThe person who has perpetuated this violence against us is not. They have no place in New Zealand. There is no place in New Zealand for such acts of extreme and unprecedented violence, which it is clear this act was.\n\nPresently, the police do have one suspect in custody. However, there could be others involved. Also, there are multiple scenes involved in this incident as well. And police will be giving more details as they can as the situation unfolds."

  "authors": [

    "Data Visualisation",
    "The Chart Doctor"
  ],
  "text": "It always pays to be aware of a chart\u2019s limitations, even useful ones. Take the iconic yield curve, a chart that shows the yields of government bonds of varying maturities. Analysts use the shape of the curve to gauge market expectations. It might even help predict recessions.\n\nBut with yields changing on a daily basis, showing how the curve evolves over time is not easy. That is because the conventional chart type for showing time series, a line chart, uses the horizontal axis to show time running from left to right. On the yield curve, that axis is occupied by each bond\u2019s maturity date.\n\nInstead, analysts often chart the \u201cspread\u201d \u2014 the percentage point difference between two bonds (typically 2-year and 10-year). This produces a useful summary of the cyclical peaks and troughs of market expectations and how they might relate to recessions, but it also throws away a lot of information from the underlying yield curve.\n\nFor example, we can no longer see what the actual yields are \u2014 have they been high or low? \u2014 and there is always the risk that the particular spread chosen might not be representative of the shape of the entire curve. And how much does the curve change on a daily basis anyway?\n\nIn 2015, Gregor Aisch and Amanda Cox of the New York Times addressed this problem by rendering the yield curve in 3D. It is a great interactive graphic that shows the yield curve in a new light.\n\nAnimation is another approach worth investigating \u2014 after all, using time itself to represent time seems logical. A rapid daily animation of the yield curve shows a month\u2019s worth of data in half a second, a year in around six seconds. Tiny daily oscillations in the curve are now visible alongside more significant monthly and annual movement.\n\nOne problem with animation is that, with data changing so fast, it becomes difficult to remember key moments in the yield curve\u2019s progression. Adding \u201cmemory lines\u201d with text annotations of the curve\u2019s \u201cpeak inversions\u201d allows us to directly compare the yield curve at different points in time.\n\nExtending the animation, to show how the yield curve has changed on a daily basis since 1979 to the present day, results in a video just over three minutes long. It is compelling, but over such a duration, almost eerily silent.\n\nOf course, we could choose to add a Hans Rosling-style commentary \u2014 but could we use the data itself to produce a soundtrack?\n\nThe process of turning spreadsheets into sound is known as data sonification, the aural equivalent of data visualisation. And it might just be the next big thing in data presentation.\n\nWith our animation, the first challenge is to map the bond yields (the y-axis of the chart) to musical pitches.\n\nWhile it might be tempting to think in terms of orthodox musical scales (\u201crecession in C minor\u201d, \u201cthe great bear run in F# major\u201d), our \u201cmusic\u201d ideally needs to preserve equal spacing between pitch in the same way as tick marks preserve distance on the chart\u2019s y-axis. The more unusual whole tone scale \u2014 beloved of Debussy \u2014 ensures that our data will be proportionally spaced in pitch. The scale was also used last year by Berliner Morgenpost to sonify SDP party polling data.\n\nMapping a whole tone scale over four octaves gives 24 evenly-spaced notes with which we can sonify the yield curve data.\n\nNext up is the challenge of how to arrange the notes. In musical terms, the yield curve visually resembles an arpeggio \u2014 a sequence of notes in which one is played after the other, rather than a chord, where all the notes are played simultaneously.\n\nWith the yield curve arpeggiating, regular, flat and inverted shapes are represented by ascending, flat and descending sequences of musical notes.\n\nPlaying each day of data as an arpeggio would require us to slow down the animation dramatically to identify individual notes. Instead, we can trigger an arpeggio sequence every 30 days while maintaining the same rapid rate of animation for the visual. The monotony of barely-changing daily tones is replaced by much greater melodic movement.\n\nFor orchestration, a marimba\u2019s pitch range is perfect for our four octave scale \u2014 though one of the advantages of controlling sound in the digital domain through data is that it gives the option of unlimited remixes.\n\nA bass drum synchronised to the month and vocal samples that \u201csing\u201d the year allow us to track the changing yield curve over time. A repeating delay on the vocal sample repeats quarterly to indicate progress through the year. The relative level of yields (high/low), the shape of the yield curve (regular/flat/inverted), and the progress of time become encoded in sonic form.\n\nAdding a sound effect to denote our \u201cpeak inversion\u201d annotations provides a final join between the visual and aural worlds, completing our transformation of the yield curve.\n\nSonification has tremendous potential to not only support and reinforce visuals, but to take data to new audiences.\n\nChancey Fleet is assistive technology co-ordinator at New York\u2019s Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library. She has a particular interest in accessible technology and how it can bring data into the everyday life of those who, like herself, cannot directly see data visualisations.\n\nWatching Ms Fleet listen to the yield curve and sketch its shape on her tactile drawing tablet provides a tantalising glimpse of what sonification might be able to do for blind or visually impaired users.\n\nShe immediately suggests an improvement: a \u201csonic legend\u201d to provide a primer on interpreting the data. And while sensible audio defaults are a good starting point, sonification is something users should be able to personalise.\n\nBut, overall, she considers the experimental yield-curve music to be a promising approach that allows her to parse information from a complex time series of over 100,000 data points.\n\nI sonified the yield curve by writing code and using specialist music software. But for this technique to truly take off into the everyday, it needs to be publicly accessible. A new open source tool funded by Google\u2019s Digital News Initiative promises to do just that.\n\nTo coincide with New York Open Data 2019 week, NYC-based Datavized has released TwoTone, an interactive tool for making music with data. The company has already explored virtual and augmented reality, but according to co-founder Hugh McGrory, the first mass adoption of immersive data storytellingwill be in audio \u201cbecause the barrier to entry is zero \u2014 everybody already has a pair of headphones\u201d.\n\nAccording to Mr McGrory, pre-release testing of TwoTone saw everything from \u201cmillennials chair dancing to music made from spreadsheets\u201d, to intense interest from cyber security outfits keen to listen to data in real time.\n\nSome might be inclined to dismiss sonification as a novelty, but a new generation of screenless devices with voice interfaces, such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa, marks the end of silent interaction with computers. It is perhaps naive to think that data will continue to just be seen and not heard.\n\nThe tools behind the musical yield curve\n\nHistorical yield curve data are freely available from the US Treasury. The data animation was created using the open source data visualisation library D3.js, with WebMidi.js generating simultaneous MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) note messages. Apple\u2019s Logic Pro X was used for sound generation."

  "text": "Innovative disruption has been a key theme of the year in business, helping companies thrive at a time of global uncertainty. We want to find out how the winners of this year's FT Boldness in Business Awards have demonstrated their resilience and daring.\n\nThe way Halo Top is disrupting the ice cream industry is that it's a very old fashioned, stayed, set in their ways market, where all the ice cream is kind of the same. We came in with a value proposition with ice cream. It's much more lower calorie, less sugar, higher in protein, and the like. And the ice-cream category hadn't seen that before. And so it disrupted the way that retailers stock ice cream. It disrupted the way distributors distributed ice cream. It disrupted the way our factories made ice cream.\n\nI think it's going to disrupt the way in which we think about investing in agriculture. Previously, investing in agriculture, specifically in developing has been seen as a really risky endeavour. But when we can fill in that gap, that information gap through data, and these predictive analytics, it makes the incentives to invest in agriculture and these developing markets much easier and less risky.\n\nSo we're going to disrupt travel. We're going to disrupt travel by offering people the way to commute over large distances at a fraction of the cost to them. So by building our air taxi, you'll be able to travel within an hour 300km at the same price of an Uber. So you can change your daily commute. You can, for example, live in the countryside and now commute to London.\n\nWell, we just want everyone to stand up and recognise their responsibility. And supermarkets are a leading cause of environmental problems. And therefore, we wanted to make a bold statement to the industry to get them to stand up, and recognise their responsibility, and do something about the scourge of plastic, palm oil, and many other environmental issues that we face.\n\nWe think the industry has been sleeping at the wheel and has been using plastic without question. And, of course, now where we're appreciating the scale of the challenge that we have on the monster that we've created with single-use plastics, and therefore, we will encourage and applaud any other supermarket, who stands up and follows our lead."

  "text": "By all accounts, the retail sector in most of the world is struggling. Rising competition from online shopping has hit bricks-and-mortar retailers hard. Environmental concerns have led customers to question traditional packaging and farming practices. And the growing preference of many consumers, particularly younger ones, to favour \u201cexperiences\u201d over stuff has eaten into overall demand.\n\nWe see the bad news everywhere: Sears, Nine West shoes and David\u2019s Bridal all filed for bankruptcy in 2018. In the UK, House of Fraser and HMV were each sold for a song. The insolvencies are striking up and down the value chain, from designer BCBG Max Azria to discount shop Poundworld. With these failures came job losses and further pressure on malls and high streets as shoppers had fewer reasons to visit.\n\nYet with adversity comes opportunity. Whenever a sector is under pressure, it gives those with creative solutions a chance to shine. Amazon emerged stronger from the 2001 dotcom bust, and decades earlier the big three US carmakers ultimately improved their offerings when their dominance was challenged by better-made Japanese imports.\n\nThere is some hope that we may be seeing that kind of resurgence today. So many of the strongest candidates for this year\u2019s Boldness in Business awards were retailers that one of the judges was moved to observe that we might be seeing a \u201cretail renaissance\u201d. The winners impressed us with how they have responded to everything from supply chain challenges to environmental degradation.\n\nTwo of our winners emerged from the groceries sector, which has been hit especially hard by changing shopping habits, concerns about waste and squeezed margins. Amazon\u2019s entry into the sector, as well as the spread of discount chains such as Lidl and Aldi, have put pressure on supermarket groups to cut costs and improve convenience.\n\nRetailers can prosper when they offer shoppers a real reason to buy there\n\nOcado, the UK online grocer and winner of the technology category, has been around for 19 years. But it has come into its own in the past two years, winning contracts to set up robotic warehouses and e-delivery services for competitors, including Wm Morrison in the UK, Casino in France, Sobeys in Canada and Kroger in the US.\n\nUnder the deals, Ocado will roll out the robotic technology it developed for its own business to improve the online services of other retailers. In other words, it has created a bright spot in the general retail gloom by helping less technologically advanced companies adapt to the shift to online shopping that is damaging so many of its competitors.\n\nThe other winner from the grocery sector, Iceland Foods, took the corporate responsibility/environment prize for its efforts to fight plastic waste and the environmental degradation associated with the use of palm oil.\n\nBased in the UK, Iceland focuses on value and frozen food. It has long sought to woo customers concerned about health and the environment \u2014 during the 1980s it was the first big UK supermarket to remove artificial colourings and non-essential preservatives from food and to ban genetically modified food.\n\nFor this year\u2019s awards, it caught the judges\u2019 eye for its #TooCoolForPlastic campaign to replace all plastic in its own-brand packaging within five years. It has stopped offering single-use bags, removed plastic from 85 per cent of packaging, including egg cartons, and trialled reverse vending machines that give customers a 10p voucher for each empty plastic bottle they put in.\n\nFast Retailing is leading the way in automation\n\nIceland\u2019s campaign against palm oil, which saw it remove the ingredient from its own-brand foods in 2018, received a big boost when advertising regulators banned its Christmas advert for being \u201ctoo political\u201d. The video, which features an animated orang-utan and highlights the problem of deforestation, has received millions of views on YouTube and social media. Iceland\u2019s next effort will be to promote sustainable fishing by selling \u201cby-catch\u201d species of fish that are caught unintentionally and usually thrown back into the sea as they are considered uncommercial.\n\nThe campaigns have helped this relatively small player stand out \u2014 like-for-like sales rose 2 per cent in the last reporting period and Iceland was named the UK\u2019s top supermarket for customer service for the second year in a row, scoring highly for \u201cemotional connection\u201d and \u201cethics\u201d. The results suggest retailers can prosper in competitive markets when they offer shoppers a real reason to buy there.\n\nThe final retailer to win in this year\u2019s competition, Fast Retailing, took the prize in the \u201cDrivers of change\u201d category. Owner of the Uniqlo, Theory, J Brand and Comptoir des Cotonniers brands, Fast Retailing is the world\u2019s third-largest seller of casual fashion, behind Zara, owned by Inditex of Spain, and H&M of Sweden.\n\nUnlike those fast-fashion chains, which restock daily and have been criticised for encouraging waste, Fast Retailing offers fewer but more classic pieces \u2014 ones that are designed to last several seasons but are affordable because of the company\u2019s efforts to keep costs down. One of the first Japanese retail groups to go global, Fast Retailing is now leading the way in automation. It has set a target for annual revenue of \u00a53tn ($27bn) by 2022, up from the \u00a52.3tn projected for 2019.\n\nOcado, Iceland and Fast Retailing are all well positioned to appeal to millennial customers, who do proportionally more online shopping and place greater emphasis on wanting corporate values that reflect their own. These companies serve as a reminder that when change hits hard, well-run, well-positioned businesses are the ones that benefit."

  "text": "Smoke billowed into the chilly night from a fire at Ocado\u2019s automated warehouse in Andover, southern England. The blaze, which started in the robot grid, gutted the online grocer\u2019s flagship distribution centre.\n\nNot for the first time in Ocado\u2019s history, investors were spooked. In two days \u00a31bn was wiped from the company\u2019s \u00a37bn market capitalisation. Before the fire in early February, the state-of-the-art Andover depot had handled 10 per cent of the retailer\u2019s capacity.\n\nYet the blaze failed to spark a sustained sale of Ocado\u2019s shares. Unlike previous bouts of bearish sentiment towards the company \u2014 which was once one of the most shorted on the London Stock Exchange \u2014 the shares recovered a good deal of their losses in the days following the fire.\n\nIt is Ocado\u2019s bold evolution \u2014 from an online grocery delivery service to a technology company with a \u00a31.6bn turnover that builds everything from consumer-facing websites to robot-operated depots for other food retailers \u2014 that analysts say has underpinned the group\u2019s new-found market resilience. This evolution has placated many of Ocado\u2019s early critics, who were concerned by what they deemed a high-cost business model with limited growth prospects.\n\nTim Steiner, a former Goldman Sachs bond trader, co-founded Ocado in 2000, sourcing goods from its trading partner, UK supermarket chain Waitrose.\n\nIt was not long after he took Ocado public in 2010 that Steiner encountered market scepticism.\n\n'Bots' operate on the 'smart platform' at Ocado's fulfilment centre in Andover, Hampshire \u00a9 Reuters\n\nBearish analysts highlighted the company\u2019s failure to secure further third-party deals following its 2013 tie-up with Wm Morrison, another UK grocer. Yet the management team held its nerve and focused on developing its technology.\n\nThe former short-seller\u2019s favourite went on to become the best-performing stock in the FTSE All-Share index in 2018, almost doubling in value during the year on the back of international expansion deals that propelled Ocado into the FTSE 100 index in June.\n\nOn the morning of the fire, Steiner was unveiling Ocado\u2019s annual results and gave a nod to the struggle by lauding his company\u2019s \u201c18-year overnight success\u201d.\n\nJust weeks later, this transformation was completed in a deal to spin off Ocado\u2019s legacy UK grocery retail business into a \u00a31.5bn joint venture with rival Marks and Spencer.\n\nTechnicians oversee the operations of the 'smart platform' at Ocado's fulfilment centre in Andover \u00a9 Reuters\n\nBruno Monteyne, an analyst at broker Bernstein, credits Ocado\u2019s management for its \u201crelentless focus\u201d on creating new technology. \u201c[Management] could have slowed down innovation a few years ago and focused on making the UK a nice cash-generative operation [to] then sell it to Waitrose. Instead, it focused on ongoing innovation,\u201d he says.\n\nIt was always part of Ocado\u2019s plan to develop some intellectual property and license it, but management had little idea of how much it would have to create until its technology teams tried to mesh third-party software with the hardware needed to build the infrastructure behind online grocery retailing.\n\nThe synthesis did not work well enough. \u201cWe started to design the facilities ourselves and write all the software ourselves, and later decided to build our own material-handling solutions and robotics ourselves,\u201d says Steiner.\n\nAn important early piece of software acted as a \u201ccontrol layer\u201d over its smart warehouses. This balanced the operations of the building. At points this meant slowing down certain zones and moving human pickers to different stations to ensure the irregularity of grocery orders did not create gridlock. \u201cEventually we created software that meant we could deal with those oscillations and operate right underneath the maximum capacity of the building,\u201d says Steiner.\n\nThe drive for efficiency and the robotics work led ultimately to the Andover warehouse, which opened in 2016, showcasing Ocado\u2019s \u201chive\u201d automation. More than 1,000 robots use a 3D grid system to move groceries from storage to human pickers. Because the robots can pass each other, the potential for gridlock is avoided.\n\nOcado has now designed everything on its platform, from the website search engine (ensuring, for example, that a search for \u201cmilk\u201d does not return a handwash or a chocolate bar) to the algorithms in its van-routing software.\n\nThe close integration of the warehouse software with the front-end consumer website means Ocado can give customers live availability and automatically reorder stock from suppliers. It also has a growing general merchandise business via brands such as Fetch, which delivers pet supplies through the same platform, and plans to trial a one-hour delivery service in London.\n\nThe next frontier is robotic picking, which should go live this year but is still some way off dealing with the 50,000-plus products of varied shape, weight and rigidity that the online grocer handles.\n\nWhen it came to selling the technology, Ocado originally kept its cards close to its chest. \u201cWe had a view that we weren\u2019t spending our shareholders\u2019 money to learn about this market to be [a] free university and to teach the rest of the world,\u201d says Steiner.\n\nOver time Ocado\u2019s exclusivity might reduce its potential\n\nBut a couple of years after the 2010 listing, management decided that showcasing Ocado\u2019s technology would not enable copying. Retailers and bankers watched the innovation in action, and soon UK supermarket chain Wm Morrison signed up for a website-to-doorstep ecommerce service.\n\nThe market was keen for more deals, but Steiner says Ocado was not ready to run multiple retailers. It focused on building a solid, replicable platform. In 2015, Ocado tried to sell the platform but struggled initially. \u201cWe set out to sell it, had a couple of hiccups along the way, but remained resolute in our beliefs,\u201d says Steiner. \u201cWe held steady.\u201d\n\nThis patience paid off in 2017-18, when Ocado signed up retailers including France\u2019s Casino and Kroger in the US: the latter an agreement in principle to provide 20 automated warehouses. The stock market lauded a turnround. Just prior to the M&S deal, Ocado\u2019s market capitalisation was equivalent to about four times its revenue, reflecting that investors valued it more like a US tech company than a UK grocer. Amazon, the US ecommerce giant, trades on more than three times its own turnover, while Tesco, the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket group, just 0.4 times.\n\nBernstein analyst Monteyne sees Ocado\u2019s advantage in the website-to-truck breadth of the ecommerce platform. For partners, a two-year window to build a smart warehouse is faster than buying separate components and putting them to work, he adds. This pace of innovation means catching up will not be easy. \u201cEverything can be copied, but even copying takes time,\u201d says Monteyne.\n\nHumans are still a key part of Ocado\u2019s warehouse operations, though robot pickers are on the horizon \u00a9 Bloomberg\n\nWhere stock market analysts once focused on Ocado\u2019s failure to do deals, now many are bullish about how far those deals can go. James Lockyer, an analyst at broker Peel Hunt, believes the technology business has the potential to become the \u201cMicrosoft of retail\u201d.\n\nThis would require Ocado to move from exclusive licensing of its platform \u2014 as with Kroger \u2014 to becoming a standard industry platform. \u201cAt the moment [Ocado] is exclusive,\u201d says Lockyer. \u201cIt is using that exclusivity to gain its deals but, over time, that might reduce its potential.\u201d\n\nBut innovation is not free. Capital investment of \u00a3170m in the 12 months to December eclipsed operating cash flow of \u00a3128m, as it has each year since listing. The company\u2019s balance sheet is healthy, but that is after \u00a3333m of proceeds from share issues last year.\n\nEvery tie-up increases the investment demand. \u201cIt\u2019s a slight irony of our accounts and our cash usage that the more successful we are, the worse our accounts will look in the short term and the more capital we\u2019ll require,\u201d says Steiner. The M&S deal will help: it will give Ocado \u00a3750m in cash for a half-share of the joint venture, which, according to the latter\u2019s management, will fund all smart warehouses currently planned.\n\nThe more bullish market-watchers see Ocado gaining strength to negotiate deals that are better for its cash flow. \u201cAs the deals get stronger, there should be more upfront payments,\u201d says Lockyer at Peel Hunt.\n\nBut sentiment could again sour. Ocado must now tackle the challenges of fulfilling its deals with Kroger and Casino. If the company is not bought out, analysts expect the group to demonstrate that these third-party tie-ups have been worth it by generating a decent return on capital. Analysts have been given little information on the terms of the deals to forecast how profitable they will be. Despite rising sales, Ocado reported a \u00a345m annual loss for 2018.\n\nOcado\u2019s management has focused on ongoing innovation\n\nThe Andover fire was a big disruption and Ocado-watchers have speculated that the blaze could unsettle the company\u2019s partners.\n\nBrexit also looms. Ocado holds just seven days of inventory by volume, as perishables cannot be stockpiled. \u201cWe run our business lean,\u201d says Steiner, adding: \u201cWe just have to hope that the government and the governments in Europe keep the ports flowing.\u201d\n\nGrocer partners will come and go, but Ocado says it will keep building. Its patent application count is close to 400. \u201cOur biggest innovation was not to try and have a single innovation,\u201d says Steiner. \u201cOur biggest innovation was to become an innovation house.\u201d"

  "text": "Tadashi Yanai is one of the few people close to SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son who will openly criticise his penchant for deals. As Son devotes more of his energy to the Saudi-backed $100bn Vision investment fund, the 70-year-old founder of Fast Retailing reminds his old friend to stay focused on his core business.\n\nBut while they often collide on risk-taking strategy, what two of Japan\u2019s most driven chief executives share is their vision of a digital transformation that has upended the businesses they founded. This is also the area where Yanai turns to Son for his views on big data, robotics and artificial intelligence.\n\nEstablished in 1963, Fast Retailing has boldly expanded to become the world\u2019s third-largest casual clothing retailer, with annual global sales of $19bn. Among other brands, the group operates more than 2,000 Uniqlo stores in over 20 countries, and expects to expand into India and Italy later this year. Overtaking larger rivals Inditex-owned Zara and Sweden\u2019s Hennes & Mauritz had long been Yanai\u2019s goal, but with ecommerce on the rise, it is also the likes of Amazon that preoccupy him these days.\n\nThe key to survival in the digital era, Yanai says, is to have the ability to collect and analyse troves of customer data to create products consumers want. For that, Yanai turned to Google last year for machine-learning and image-recognition technologies to analyse product trends and predict consumer demand. \u201cI want to make clothing the world\u2019s cutting-edge business,\u201d Yanai said at a Google Cloud Next event in Tokyo last September.\n\nTadashi Yanai, Fast Retailing chief executive \u00a9 Bloomberg\n\nBut churning out hit products is not enough in the era of ecommerce. Like Amazon, Fast Retailing needed to establish a seamless logistics and supply chain network that will allow its products to be delivered without delay to the \u201cI-want-it-now\u201d millennial generation.\n\nIf Google is Fast Retailing\u2019s partner for AI, its ally in the overhaul of its supply chain is global logistics giant Daifuku, which helped transform Fast Retailing\u2019s flagship warehouse in Tokyo into a 24-hour operation by replacing 90 per cent of its workers with robots.\n\nThe company plans to spend $900m to automate other warehouses worldwide within the next few years to address labour shortages, storage costs and lags in delivery. \u201cNo matter how good our products and stores may be, we need to have strong logistics to connect the two,\u201d Yanai says.\n\nAt its distribution centre in Tokyo\u2019s Ariake district, the only work done by humans is the process of collecting items and placing them in cardboard boxes to be shipped to customers \u2014 robotic arms are not yet proficient at picking up soft materials such as clothing. But all the picking of items off warehouse shelves is performed by robots.\n\nThe robotics system carries out all other labour, such as inspections and sorting of goods by reading their electronic tags. The products are then wrapped in a cardboard box and whisked away on a conveyor belt. Such methods have cut the time between order and despatch to as little as 15 minutes, compared with the eight to 16 hours it took previously.\n\nThe overhaul of Fast Retailing\u2019s logistics system did not come easily \u2014 nor with the speed that Yanai had originally envisioned.\n\nHard lessons were learnt when the company suffered a logistics meltdown in 2015, leading to severe supply problems with its best-selling products and the costly accumulation of unsold inventory in its warehouses. In those days, its Heattech thermal underwear was delivered to its warehouses in May, then stored for five months before going on sale in the autumn.\n\n\u201cWe used to just leave everything to our warehouse operators and there was no consistency. As a result, cost management was lax and we fell into a situation where the costs just kept on rising,\u201d says Takuya Jimbo, an executive in charge of the group\u2019s supply chain reform.\n\nFast Retailing has more than 2,000 Uniqlo stores around the world, like in Tokyo\u2019s Ginza district \u00a9 Bloomberg\n\nFast Retailing is not alone in trying to adapt to the accelerating shift towards internet shopping and competition from online entrants such as Amazon. H&M was one of the first fashion retailers into online selling, but in recent years it has focused on the rapid growth of physical stores.\n\nAs that strategy began to falter, the company tried to adjust that balance, investing in automated warehouses to achieve next-day delivery for 90 per cent of its European customers. But replacing its logistics systems has not been cheap, with rising costs depressing its earnings.\n\nInditex of Spain has 19 warehouses around the world dedicated to fulfilling online orders, which account for about 10 per cent of its annual sales. The company has invested in improving its \u201cclick and collect\u201d services that allow consumers to pick up products ordered online at a nearby store.\n\nFor Fast Retailing, analysts say the challenge will be how it can strike a balance between online and physical store customer experience while maintaining margins in the face of pricing pressures. In addition to the risk of declining footfall in stores, finding a balanced logistics strategy for high street stores and ecommerce will not be simple.\n\nUniqlo in Singapore\u2019s Orchard Central mall \u00a9 Getty\n\nFast Retailing\u2019s annual online sales are about 7 per cent in Japan, 20 per cent in the US and 15 per cent in China. Yanai says he wants to increase that ratio to 30 per cent globally over the next few years.\n\n\u201cThe more you increase ecommerce, the faster you will close down physical stores. That has at least been the standard in Europe and the US, and Fast Retailing could go down the same path,\u201d says Kensuke Kojima, a fashion business consultant in Tokyo.\n\nStill, analysts say few in the retail industry have been as aggressive as Yanai in investing in new technologies and seeking out new partners to ensure its business model can survive the age of digital commerce.\n\n\u00a9 Getty\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about Yanai\u2019s leadership,\u201d says Dairo Murata, an analyst at JPMorgan Securities. \u201cThe company does everything from manufacturing to development of materials, factory management, logistics and distribution. That is why it can take risks, because it controls everything. That\u2019s rare in the retail industry.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the threat posed by Amazon and Zozotown, a Japanese online marketplace, Yanai points to Fast Retailing\u2019s breadth of operations. \u201cI firmly don\u2019t believe Amazon and Zozo will dominate the entire apparel market. In fact, I think it is our strength that we do everything from planning and manufacturing to sales,\u201d he says.\n\nThe company can take risks, because it controls everything. That\u2019s rare in the retail industry\n\nA big part of Fast Retailing\u2019s success in launching hit products has been Yanai\u2019s ability to pick the right partners. Long before Google and Daifuku, collaboration with carbon fibre maker Toray resulted in new materials, such as Heattech and Sarafine, which retain heat in cold weather or breathe in the sweltering summers, respectively.\n\nFast Retailing expects its list of technology partners to grow. \u201cIn the apparel industry, one company cannot dominate the world and it is necessary to grow together with partners,\u201d Yanai said in late 2017.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any company other than Fast Retailing that can partner with the world\u2019s top players, from Toray, Mitsubishi, Accenture, Disney, Apple, Google and Alibaba to Tencent.\u201d"

  "text": "Like many people in business, Sara Menker is trying to fill a gap in the market. For the founder of agricultural data and analytics company Gro Intelligence, that gap is a looming global food shortfall that she says is equivalent to 379bn Big Mac hamburgers \u2014 more than McDonald\u2019s has sold in its history.\n\nDiscussions about global food security often focus on how to satisfy World Bank projections of a 70 per cent increase in food demand by 2050. That date, says Menker, is \u201cso abstractly far away that we don\u2019t see the train wreck that\u2019s coming in front of us\u201d.\n\nThe crisis she predicts is a global annual deficit of up to 214tn calories, or 379bn Big Macs, by 2027. A combination of young populations and economic growth in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa could create an unbalanced world in terms of food supply and demand. This could be exacerbated by a possible reversal of India\u2019s long-standing self-sufficiency in food, according to Gro forecasts, with the country joining China and Africa as a net importer of calories.\n\n\u201cHow do you drive efficiency across farms locally to improve yields and production? It\u2019s not like you just keep planting more,\u201d Menker argues. \u201cYou have to build some efficiencies into the system.\u201d\n\nThe implications of a planet unable to feed itself is why many are pushing for a change of attitude towards commercial farming in China, India and Africa, and to the approach to agricultural trading and shipping.\n\nWhere big data and artificial intelligence companies such as Gro are looking to play a role is by uncovering information and trends that send signals to the market. Such data could, for example, encourage the building of storage facilities to cut food waste at the farm level or help to price credit accurately.\n\nBorn and raised in Ethiopia, Menker attended university in the US and landed a job as an energy trader with Morgan Stanley. The decision to start Gro in 2014 emerged as her interest switched from energy to understanding the global agricultural system.\n\nMenker\u2019s approach to the interdependencies of the sector \u2014 from understanding soils to government policies and trade deals \u2014 has shaped Gro. The company, with a team of more than 60 split between Nairobi and New York, has set out to create a map of supply and demand across commodities, countries and languages.\n\n\u201cInitially the thesis was where we could make the biggest impact and the longest-term opportunities: so, developing markets,\u201d Menker says.\n\n\u201cBut it is impossible to understand emerging markets without understanding the agricultural system. It is impossible to understand corn in Kenya without understanding corn in the US, or wheat in Nigeria without understanding Russia, Ukraine and India.\n\n\u201cThe thing about developing markets is that they sit in a global market, and looking at agriculture in a fragmented way is dangerous \u2014 that is what we are trying to undo.\u201d\n\nAlthough it has spent much of the five years since its inception fine-tuning and testing models, Gro had an opportunity to prove itself during the 35-day US government shutdown between December 2018 and January 2019. This left market participants unsure when they would receive critical crop and livestock data.\n\nUsing its machine learning-based predictive models, Gro released its own version of the market-moving World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report, which is published monthly by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) but was delayed by the shutdown.\n\nGro has been critical of the WASDE report, saying last year it was based on a \u201cforecasting model that is dangerously out of date\u201d and jeopardised the stability of crops such as corn and soyabeans. Seth Meyer, chairman of the USDA\u2019s World Agricultural Outlook Board, which produces the WASDE report, responded: \u201cWe don\u2019t just let the computer tell us what the estimate is. Satellite imagery is not a replacement for farmer surveys or on-the-ground sampling.\u201d\n\nGro had planned to release a \u201cfreemium\u201d, or free basic, version of its service in March, but instead granted free access to its website during the shutdown. Menker says more than 1,000 clients signed up within four weeks, including some of \u201cthe world\u2019s largest institutions\u201d.\n\nBeyond Gro\u2019s calls for a more transparent and dynamic approach from the USDA, the recent episode highlighted broader concerns around transparency, reliability and ownership of data.\n\nMenker is adamant that Gro should remain independent, to allow it to develop a broad and diverse ecosystem of clients and users. The company has two major backers \u2014 TPG Growth, an early backer of Airbnb, Spotify and Uber, and Data Collective, a California-based venture capital group with a penchant for big-data companies.\n\nA challenge is the ability to \u201cflow and combine\u201d data with other market participants that could improve Gro\u2019s value, says Bernard Engel, professor of agricultural and biological engineering at Purdue University in Indiana. \u201cThere are some fantastic data sets at different levels of government. If you can\u2019t put together data from these entities, you are missing opportunities.\u201d\n\nTied to the question of ownership is a bigger one about who benefits from new technologies and insights, and how quickly and deeply that proliferates in the industry.\n\nFor Keith Coble, professor of agricultural economics at Mississippi State University, the question of how big data affects small stakeholders is one he struggles with. \u201cIn some instances the economies of scale here are such that you\u2019re not going to be able to use this technology unless you have a high-tech office,\u201d he says. He adds, however, that big data could help create better insurance products for small farms in a development context.\n\n\u201cIn some sense you will see the larger producer being the one to benefit the most, but I don\u2019t think every aspect of this will benefit the large farmers only,\u201d says Coble.\n\nHow the small farmer benefits from a product like ours is when your cost of capital goes down\n\nThe cost and availability of financing and insurance to agriculture is one of the main concerns. The sector\u2019s share of total global credit supply was just 2.9 per cent in 2017, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. Menker says that in Africa, although 63 per cent of the population is in farming, less than 1 per cent of outstanding bank loans there have exposure to agriculture. Banks and insurers lack a clear understanding of a farm\u2019s operations and may be reluctant to lend, or else do so at a punitive rate, she says.\n\nGro works with \u201ceveryone in the agricultural ecosystem but the farmer\u201d, Menker says, reeling off a list ranging from those who sell seed and other farm inputs to banks, insurers and food and beverage companies. \u201cOur thesis is that you get the system around the farmer more efficient. So how the small farmer benefits from a product like ours, or how agriculture benefits from a product like ours, is when your cost of capital goes down.\u201d\n\nOther key questions are how private data are curated, their reliability and their statistical veracity, says Robbin Shoemaker, national programme leader for the Division of Agricultural Systems at the USDA\u2019s National Institute of Food and Agriculture. \u201cData from private sources can be packaged and sold without any understanding of the quality of it. There could be big issues there when it comes to determining actuarially sound premiums for insurance,\u201d he says.\n\nEngel at Purdue University says increasing food production is going to require measures ranging from advances in agriculture, to insights provided by big data and analytics groups, as well as changes in consumption habits.\n\nIn the meantime, Menker says Gro will continue to promote its vision of a world where access to agricultural data is not a privilege of the few.\n\n\u201cOne of the barriers to knowledge in agriculture is complexity \u2014 of language, of scientific knowledge, of the format in which the data is reported,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you take away that complexity, you can increase the base knowledge across the ecosystem. By doing that can you make our markets a lot more efficient.\u201d"

  "text": "For the first 250 metres it all goes well. I am in Singapore, in the back of a prototype driverless car, gazing at the other side of the road. Then our car decides to veer slowly into the path of the oncoming rubbish truck.\n\nOur emergency driver lunges for the wheel, yanks us back to safety, then tells me the game plan. This isn\u2019t a vanilla driverless car, he explains, it is a do-it-yourself driverless car, made with off-the-shelf technology, and the goal is to get it on the road as fast as possible.\n\nBut the car, which works a treat for the rest of the day, is only step one. Step two is to fully automate Singapore\u2019s economy. Step three is to put all citizens on universal basic incomes. Step four is to use facial recognition technologies to close off the city to unwanted foreign migrants. It is a straight line, in other words, from the technological to the economic to the social, then the political.\n\nIf the 2010s were the decade of the unicorn \u2014 the mythical beast of the $1bn tech start-up \u2014 the 2020s appear poised for a unicorn stampede. With Timandra Harkness, the co-presenter of our BBC Radio 4 show FutureProofing, I have spent the past three years scanning the horizon for what is coming in terms of disruptive technologies. The cupboard isn\u2019t bare: eggless synthetic biology scrambled eggs, stem cell rejuvenation, weaponised nanobots, the colonisation of Mars, passenger-bearing mega-drones and brain-to-brain communication systems.\n\nAcross disparate fields, from artificial intelligence to robotics, from 3D printing to nanotechnology, from genetics to quantum computing, a pattern is emerging: technological developments are starting not just to accelerate but to amplify one another.\n\nThey are poised to reshape the business landscape. The core capacity we are going to need to survive, says Astro Teller, the so-called Captain of Moonshots at X, Google\u2019s research unit, may be dynamic stability \u2014 the velocity to stay upright.\n\nThe question is: What are the problems we are looking to solve?\n\nBut as the rubbish-truck economy of Henry Ford\u2019s fossil-driven mass production starts to yield to the age of the algorithm, what is the impact on business and society? Where does this rollercoaster look like it is going to take us?\n\nMy hunch it is not just speed that matters, it is direction. If technology is not the answer but the amplifier of intent, there is a primary question we have to answer: What are the problems we are looking to solve?\n\nIt looks like there are two different directions emerging. We have the option to prize artificial over human intelligence, to deploy technology in a centralised model that solves for shareholder value at the expense of jobs, that automates \u2014 according to projections by University of Oxford academics Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne \u2014 47 per cent of US and UK white-collar jobs by 2035.\n\nThis would hit national balance sheets with the double whammy of lower tax revenues and surging welfare costs, and set the stage \u2014 with increased inequality and the perception of an economy no longer working for the many \u2014 for broader support for challenger populist movements.\n\nBut there is also another option: to do the opposite, not to replace human intelligence but to augment it. Go back 1,000 years and the means of production was the land, and the barrier to entry was the wall. For the past 200 years the means of production has been the factory, and the barrier to entry the capital to own it. But with this new set of technologies, from APIs, the cloud and open data, to the sharing economy and micro-printing, the barriers to entry are dropping fast.\n\nThe potential is there, to unlock a new wave of cognitive surplus and put power in people\u2019s hands to drive innovations across the challenges that confront us, from distributed solar energy to data-driven banking for the unbanked, from 3D-printed ultra-low-cost housing to sensor-based micro-irrigation for drought-resilient agriculture.\n\nWhat does real boldness look like for me as we head into the 2020s? It is boldness not just of execution but of intent."

  "text": "Inventing the world wide web might be considered a remarkable enough achievement for one lifetime. But Sir Tim Berners-Lee has another burning ambition: to reinvent it.\n\nThirty years ago, Sir Tim designed much of the architecture for our information age, ensuring that the web was open, free and accessible to everyone. The creation of this user-friendly interface with the internet has led to an astonishing explosion of communication and creativity, changing our world in incalculable ways. Some 4bn people now enjoy near-instant access to more information than their grandparents could ever have imagined.\n\nBut in more recent years the web has taken a dark turn as corporate, state and criminal interests have sought to exploit its radical openness. Our information age, which still promises so much, has been disfigured by the emergence of surveillance capitalism, electoral manipulation and cyber crime.\n\nSir Tim has grown increasingly distressed at how his invention has turned into an \u201cengine of inequity and division\u201d, as he describes it. Fixing this emergent \u201canti-human\u201d phenomenon has become the urgent priority of his life as the remaining unconnected people in the world today and future generations come online over the next few decades.\n\n\u201cWe did create all kinds of wonderful things on the web. But looking back at the past few years, we have realised that there has been a lot of dysfunction in society,\u201d says Sir Tim, in an interview down a crackly line from Australia. \u201cPeople are being manipulated to vote against their own best interests. The foundations of democracy are threatened.\u201d\n\nThe critical question confronting all our societies is whether the web\u2019s flaws are a temporary bug that can be fixed or a permanent feature that can, at best, be contained. Ever the computer geek, Sir Tim is convinced there is a technological solution. His purpose is now to fix the bug and build a more respectful and powerful web that answers to our real human needs.\n\nWorld Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee takes part in an event marking the 30 years of World Wide Web \u00a9 FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP/Getty Images Sir Tim Berners-Lee at Cern, where he developed what would become the world wide web \u00a9 Cern\n\nSince 2015, Sir Tim has been working with a small team of computer scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to design a new data platform called Solid (the name is derived from \u201csocial linked data\u201d). Last year, he announced the launch of Inrupt, a for-profit company intended to put Solid into operation.\n\nThousands of developers across 26 countries are experimenting with 50,000 Solid personal online data stores (PODs). The company is also collaborating with some bigger partners, including an Indian telecoms company and the UK\u2019s National Health Service, to explore how Solid could be configured at scale.\n\nTo that end, Inrupt is aiming to complete a multimillion-dollar fundraising by the end of March, enabling it to launch a user product by the end of the year. In tech jargon, Solid is aiming to \u201cre-decentralise\u201d the web, returning ownership of data to the users who generate it and empowering them to give consent to others to access it.\n\nWe know how to fire rockets into the sky. We should be able to build constructive social networks\n\n\u201cSolid solves a few problems at once because it is a paradigm shift,\u201d says Sir Tim. \u201cBut if you had to pick one it would be: giving people complete control of their data.\u201d\n\nThe challenges of scaling Solid are daunting, to say the least. Companies and governments have strong vested interests in maintaining the current data ecosystem; billions of users have built their lives around free and convenient services; and the technological and financial demands of launching an alternative platform are immense.\n\nBut friends say the 63-year-old computer scientist has been energised by his latest mission. \u201cIt is rocket science. It is tricky. Things can blow up on you,\u201d says Sir Tim. \u201cBut we know how to fire rockets into the sky. We should be able to build constructive social networks.\u201d\n\nThe computer used at CERN by British scientist Tim Berners-Lee to devise the World Wide Web \u00a9 SSPL via Getty Images\n\nGiven what has happened over the past three decades, the origins of the web now seem a long time ago and far, far away. Back in 1989, Sir Tim was working in Switzerland as a software engineer at Cern, the world\u2019s largest particle physics laboratory. Bashing away on his NeXT computer, he devised an online information space in which documents could be identified by uniform resource locators (URLs) and connected by hypertext links, enabling easy navigation between pages.\n\nIn his book Weaving The Web, he compared the effort needed to launch the web with that required to race a bobsleigh: everyone had to push hard for a seemingly long time, but once the bobsleigh built up momentum, everyone could jump on board and enjoy the ride.\n\nThe critical accelerant for the web\u2019s development was Sir Tim\u2019s selfless decision not to patent his invention, probably passing up the opportunity to earn billions of dollars in the process but keeping cyberspace open and non-proprietary. In the words of the science writer James Gleick, the web was \u201cThe Patent That Never Was.\u201d\n\nAs a result, cyberspace has grown at mesmerising speed. There are now almost 4.2bn internet users around the world, accessing close to 2bn websites, according to the latest ever-changing data from internetlivestats.com.\n\nSome people say we are turning the web on its head. But we like to think we are turning it the right way up\n\nIan Goldin, a professor of globalisation and development at the University of Oxford and co-author of Age of Discovery, argues that the mass adoption of the web can only be compared to the invention of the printing press in 15th-century Europe and its revolutionary effect on communication. The arrival of the web has opened a new era of information abundance, cheap distribution, radical variety and wide participation, he argues, that is comparable to a new Renaissance.\n\n\u201cThe web has been a huge net positive for humanity. It has been as revolutionary as the Gutenberg press in transforming the way that ideas are shaped and shared,\u201d says Goldin. \u201cI cannot think of another technology over the past 30 years that has changed so much for so many so quickly.\u201d\n\nA tweet from Sir Tim Berners-Lee is displayed during the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games \u00a9 Philippe Petit/Paris Match via Getty Images\n\nThe widespread adoption of the printing press in Europe and the mass diffusion of ideas helped transform one of the most backward regions of the planet into its leading centre of innovation. \u201cThis is now happening at a much, much bigger scale with the web, enabling people from all corners of the planet to learn from each other,\u201d says Goldin. \u201cHip-hop dancers in Harlem can now learn moves from hip-hop dancers in Shanghai.\u201d\n\nBut communication revolutions enable bad ideas to spread just as quickly as good. \u201cThe Gutenberg press led to the explosion of genius, but it also led to 200 years of religious wars and gave voice to Savonarola,\u201d says Goldin, describing the publicity-savvy Florentine firebrand as a \u201c15th-century Donald Trump\u201d.\n\nInrupt\u2019s ambition is to maximise the upsides of the web while minimising its downsides.\n\nJohn Bruce, Inrupt\u2019s chief executive, argues that the Solid platform will create tangible benefits for all three of the web\u2019s biggest constituencies: its users, service providers and developers.\n\nUsers, he says, will enjoy greater privacy and functionality by integrating all their digital services more securely on their devices. Service providers can concentrate on what they do well, such as selling shoes, rather than worrying about things they do badly, such as managing data. And developers will be able to design apps for the direct benefit of users, rather than the tech companies and advertisers that stand behind them.\n\n\u201cSolid is hugely liberating for all of us, which is why it is so significant for the web,\u201d says Bruce. \u201cSome people say we are turning the web on its head. But we like to think we are turning it the right way up. Inrupt is not just encouraging this new ecosystem but leading it.\u201d\n\nSir Tim says the Solid team are laying down new architectural rules about how things can operate online. \u201cFor the moment, it is a team of people with a vision making a very co-ordinated effort to do things in an extremely deliberate way so that we make sure this thing does behave like we want it to and it has the impact it promises,\u201d he says.\n\nIf Inrupt can get things right, Sir Tim believes Solid could help unleash an exciting new wave of innovation as developers benefit from the freer flow of valuable data. \u201cIf you pay a developer to make trusted apps, or you use open-source apps that are not going to advertise to you, or ambush you, or distract you, then you trust them more and you will give them access to a lot more data,\u201d he says.\n\nOne problem Solid solves is giving people complete control of their data\n\n\u201cI think we will be able to use very powerful apps that have access to all our data. We will be able to share anything we want with anybody. I can share my hospital records with my doctor, I can share my photos with my cousin.\u201d\n\nThe odds would appear to be stacked against Sir Tim and the Solid team. First, they are betting against complacency, assuming that users care enough to pay for trusted apps and spend time managing their own data settings. Second, they are betting against deeply entrenched interests that did not exist when the web was first created.\n\n\u201cIt may be possible to create a clean web,\u201d says one digital expert. \u201cBut there are too many powerful and corrupt state and corporate interests intent on keeping it dirty.\u201d\n\nIf Sir Tim really does succeed in revolutionising mass communication for a second time, his latest accomplishment may yet be considered almost as significant as his first. One adjective best describes Sir Tim\u2019s ambition: bold."

  "text": "Lift the gold lid of a tub of Halo Top ice cream and you will be greeted with a cheery message printed on the seal, such as \u201cSave the bowl\u201d, \u201cStop when you hit the bottom\u201d or \u201cGuilt-free zone\u201d.\n\nThe slogans encapsulate the promise that has earned the low-calorie, high-protein ice cream a legion of fans since it was created by Justin Woolverton as an experiment in his Los Angeles kitchen in 2011.\n\nHalo Top offers the indulgence of premium ice cream but with much less of the sugar and fat contained in traditional brands such as Ben & Jerry\u2019s or H\u00e4agen-Dazs. A 473ml tub of Halo Top\u2019s Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough will set you back 360 calories, compared with 1,120 for the Ben & Jerry\u2019s equivalent.\n\nHalo Top\u2019s simple proposition, paired with the online marketing savvy of Woolverton, 39, and his business partner Douglas Bouton, 33, has won over calorie-counting consumers. In barely six years, Halo Top has become North America\u2019s sixth-biggest ice cream brand, with a 3.7 per cent market share in 2018, according to Euromonitor data. The private company does not disclose financial information, but its co-founders say it has about 120 employees, and is profitable and growing rapidly.\n\nWoolverton and Bouton have retained majority control after declining several takeover offers and raising $1.5m from a combination of friends and family, angel investors and crowdfunding.\n\nTo build on its success in the US, Halo Top has embarked on an international expansion drive, launching last year in the UK and Canada with flavours such as Peanut Butter Cup, Mint Chip and Birthday Cake.\n\nWhen Justin Woolverton, above, turned to outsourced manufacturing, it proved a key factor in scaling up the business\n\nThe looming challenge will be to encourage international consumers to develop a taste for Halo Top by adapting its sales pitch to countries with differing food cultures and dietary habits.\n\n\u201cSo far in the UK, we\u2019ve seen the same meteoric growth as in the US. We outsell H\u00e4agen-Dazs in Tesco [the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket chain],\u201d says Bouton with a hint of disbelief. \u201cIt was so hard to build the company in the first few years \u2014 we almost went bankrupt. But now we\u2019ve gotten to a level of stability so we can actually enjoy it, innovate and build the business.\u201d\n\nThe two Californians, who knew little about ice cream or retail when they started out, surprised many industry executives who scoffed at the idea that a newcomer could break into a category that has long been dominated by multinationals Unilever and Nestl\u00e9.\n\nIn the process, Halo Top has become a poster child for the new reality shaking the consumer goods industry: the rise of challenger brands in everything from razors to dog food. Pitching themselves as greener, more local, more authentic or healthier than mainstream products, these upstarts often sell directly to consumers via online channels and use social media to attract attention.\n\nGraeme Pitkethly, Unilever\u2019s chief financial officer, admits the consumer goods giant \u201chad missed the trend in the US\u201d for healthier ice cream and that Halo Top is taking share \u201cvery, very quickly\u201d. Unilever and Nestl\u00e9 have scrambled to catch up; both have introduced copy-cat \u201chealthier for you\u201d ice creams in the US. Launched in mid-2017, Unilever\u2019s Breyers Delight mimicked Halo Top by placing the calorie count in large figures on the tub label.\n\nBouton says the new rival brands were not totally unwelcome, although their arrival slowed Halo Top\u2019s growth last year. The company\u2019s US retail sales in 2018 fell 6.4 per cent year on year to $329m, while units sold rose 4 per cent to 77.5m, according to IRi, a Chicago-based market research firm.\n\n\u201cIt validates the market for healthier ice cream, which we pioneered,\u201d says Bouton. \u201cBut there are now too many brands for the space, so retailers will cull the brands and keep the best ones.\u201d\n\nHalo Top\u2019s prominent display of calorie counts on its packaging has been imitated by rivals\n\nSo how did Halo Top go from being a creation in a home kitchen to filling supermarket freezers? It began with Woolverton, who in 2011 was working as a corporate lawyer in Los Angeles but was bored with his job. A fitness buff who was keen to optimise his diet, he experimented with fasting and often cut out sugar to help control his hypoglycaemia. However, he had a sweet tooth and missed eating ice cream.\n\nSeeking alternatives, he started tinkering in his kitchen, first by freezing Chobani, a brand of thick, high-protein Greek-style yoghurt, and adding fruit and sugar substitutes.\n\nEventually his creations became more serious. \u201cI didn\u2019t necessarily have weight issues. The driving force for me was that these were low-sugar products,\u201d Woolverton told the Financial Times last year. An idea then occurred to him. \u201cIf people like Chobani \u2014 and I like Chobani, and I like this ice cream I\u2019m making \u2014 I think other people might like this ice cream I\u2019m making.\u201d\n\nWoolverton hit upon a recipe that was sweetened with stevia, a sugar substitute made from a leafy shrub native to Paraguay, and erythritol, a no-calorie sugar alcohol found in fruits such as pears and grapes that adds texture; both ingredients can, therefore, be described as \u201cnatural\u201d in marketing materials. The recipe also includes milk, cream and air.\n\nNow we\u2019re at a level of stability, we can build the business\n\nBut scaling up from batches made in his kitchen was not easy. Woolverton looked for \u201cco-packers\u201d \u2014 manufacturers that produce packaged foods under contract, often for big food companies or retailers.\n\nThe existence of such outsourced manufacturing capacity has been an important factor in the rise of challenger brands in the consumer sector. Without it, few would have be able to turn their ideas into real products at scale.\n\nAfter almost a year, Woolverton figured out how to make bigger batches of his ice cream and signed a deal with a California-based manufacturer. Using credit cards and loans, he paid a designer to create the packaging and logo, and convinced a local gourmet store to carry the product. He then enlisted Bouton, a friend who was also a lawyer, to join him scaling up the business.\n\nThey built the brand initially by using targeted Google search ads and marketing on Facebook; they eschewed television adverts, which they could not afford anyway. But the most important channel for building the brand was Instagram, the photo-sharing app. Halo Top gave free samples to thousands of \u201cinfluencers\u201d \u2014 athletes, gym trainers and healthy-living gurus \u2014 with a critical mass of followers the company thought might like the product. \u201cWe were constantly reaching out to people to try to get the word out about Halo Top,\u201d explains Bouton.\n\nA viral news story in early 2016 was a catalyst for the brand: a science journalist for GQ magazine ate nothing but Halo Top for 10 days and lost more than 4kg. Sales took off.\n\nHowever, success attracted imitators, and the arrival of competing products in the US made Halo Top realise it needed to expand abroad or risk losing the first-to-market advantage that was crucial to its local success. \u201cWith their scale, we knew Unilever and Nestl\u00e9 would be able to roll out their healthier ice creams much more quickly than we could,\u201d says Bouton.\n\nIn mid-2017, the business partners began to determine how to get Halo Top on sale in as many countries as possible, as fast as possible.\n\nThis was harder than they expected. Since their ice cream was manufactured in the US, it would have to be shipped internationally and be kept frozen during transit.\n\nFiguring out local regulations and securing distribution were also a headache. \u201cI felt like I was banging my head against the wall because we were having to reinvent the wheel for every new market,\u201d says Bouton.\n\nI felt we were having to reinvent the wheel for every new market\n\nThen over the summer of 2017, Bouton heard from a stranger offering to help. Matt Fulbrook, a former sales director for Ben & Jerry\u2019s in the UK, sent him an email, asking if Halo Top had thought of expanding to the UK. \u201cWe are a team of three ice cream guys with over 50 years collective experience within the UK ice cream sector . . . and know there could be an opportunity here for you,\u201d Fulbook wrote.\n\nWithin weeks, the two had met and signed a deal under which Fulbrook\u2019s company, Brand of Brothers, would help Halo Top expand to Europe in exchange for a commission on sales. That connection enabled Halo Top to obtain UK distribution quickly. Tesco was the first to sign up, and by the fourth quarter of 2017, eight other customers, including supermarkets Sainsbury\u2019s. Morrisons and Asda, had also agreed to stock the ice cream.\n\nOn the branding side, Halo Top knew it had to tailor its advertising and marketing for a British audience or risk not connecting with consumers as it had in the US. \u201cOur brand\u2019s voice has to be authentic and genuine \u2014 the antithesis of the big corporation or conglomerate,\u201d says Bouton.\n\nHalo Top hired local staff and ad agencies, and produced an ice cream flavour called Lemon Wedding Cake: a homage to the choice of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry for their wedding cake last year. Halo Top\u2019s efforts appear to be paying off: in its first year on the market, the company recorded UK sales of \u00a320.2m, according to IRi.\n\nThe group found a contract manufacturer in Germany, which will soon start making the ice cream that is sold in continental Europe, replacing stock currently shipped across the Atlantic. Halo Top has also started selling in the Netherlands and Germany.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in 12 countries right now,\u201d says Bouton. \u201cIf we wanted to, we could double that quickly, but we want to go slower to make sure we do it right.\u201d"

  "text": "The unveiling of Christmas television advertisements is an annual ritual in the UK\u2019s hugely competitive retail market. Yet the commercial judged to be the most effective in 2018 never made it on to the nation\u2019s TV screens.\n\nAdvertising agency Kantar Millward Brown conducts consumer research into the effectiveness of festive campaigns. It says the expensive effort by department store John Lewis featuring singer Elton John and a schmaltzy Sainsbury\u2019s supermarket advert about a school play both had less resonance than Iceland Foods\u2019 low-budget animated feature about an orangutan made homeless by deforestation.\n\nRichard Walker, managing director of the frozen food chain, says the \u201cRang-Tan\u201d advert was originally made for Greenpeace, the environmental lobby group of which he is a member. \u201cThey showed us a rough cut of this campaign video they had: it brought a tear to my eyes. We thought it would be great if we could use it as our Christmas advert,\u201d he says.\n\nClearcast, the organisation controlled by broadcasters that approves adverts, had other ideas. It refused to clear the advert because it had previously appeared on the Greenpeace website and the group had some of the legal characteristics of a political organisation. Instead, the advert was released online \u2014 with a generous dose of \u201cthe ad they tried to ban\u201d publicity \u2014 and promptly went viral. It was viewed more than 70m times worldwide, while a petition launched in the UK urging Clearcast to reconsider received more than 1m signatures.\n\nWalker is adamant Iceland did not plan for this turn of events as a cost-effective way to upstage bigger rivals. \u201cWe thought debadging it would be enough to get it past Clearcast. I genuinely did not think it would be banned.\u201d He says the company had booked more than \u00a3600,000 of television advertising slots to air the commercial.\n\nRichard Walker says by wrapping bananas in a cardboard girdle, Iceland is saving 10m plastic bags a year\n\nThe advert refers to the clearing of forests in Indonesia and Malaysia to make way for palm oil plantations. According to Greenpeace, an area equivalent to 146 football pitches is cleared every day in Indonesia alone. \u201cRainforests cover only 2 per cent of the planet\u2019s surface but account for half its biodiversity. They are the crown jewels,\u201d says Walker, who in April 2018 pledged to remove palm oil from all Iceland\u2019s own-label products by last December to persuade the industry to stop clearing forests.\n\nIceland\u2019s choice of campaign theme might seem an odd one for a company that, since its foundation in 1970, has targeted customers at the value end of the shopping spectrum. It lacks the scale of other supermarkets \u2014 its annual revenue of \u00a33bn is a fraction of the \u00a351bn (excluding fuel) that UK market leader Tesco achieves, or the SFr91.4bn ($90.6bn) posted by food multinational Nestl\u00e9. Iceland\u2019s palm oil consumption for own label products, about 500 tonnes a year, was inconsequential in a global context; consumer goods giant Unilever gets through 1.5m tonnes annually, and total world yearly production is 72m tonnes.\n\nWalker acknowledges the move was at least partly a personal one. \u201cWere [customers] screaming down the aisles saying, \u2018If only there was no palm oil\u2019? No, but I am so proud that now some customers, some of whom only have \u00a320 a week or so to spend on food, are talking about palm oil \u2014 where it comes from, the pros and cons,\u201d he says.\n\nEnvironmentalists such as Jonathan Porritt say UK retailers generally have a good record on palm oil \u2014 the World Wide Fund for Nature rates most of them highly on progress towards ensuring that record is sustainable, mostly via participation in the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), an industry standards body.\n\nBut Iceland was the first to propose removing palm oil from its products altogether \u2014 a controversial move in many respects. It was derided by Porritt (who is an adviser to Sime Darby, a producer of sustainable palm oil) as \u201can almost entirely meaningless gesture\u201d. Other critics say switching to alternatives would have a catastrophic impact on the smallholders who cultivate palm oil.\n\nWalker acknowledges such matters are rarely clear cut. Palm oil is a widely used ingredient because it is one of the cheapest vegetable fats and is much higher yielding than many alternatives. Sunflower or rapeseed, for instance, require far more land to produce the same volume. He says his objection is specifically to deforestation, and that \u201cit would be great\u201d if improved sustainability meant he could remove the \u201cNo Palm Oil\u201d branding proliferating across Iceland\u2019s ranges.\n\nThe palm oil ban is not the first occasion Iceland has made a bold move in the name of the environment. Two decades before, it was the first UK supermarket to ban genetically modified (GM) ingredients. Previous initiatives have included recycling freezers containing ozone-depleting chemicals and removing artificial colourings and preservatives from foods.\n\nThe man behind many of those decisions was not Walker but his father, Sir Malcolm Walker, the company\u2019s founder and executive chairman, who claims to have coined the phrase \u201cFrankenstein foods\u201d. \u201cOur business was about walking a tightrope between what people will spend on food and the absolute quality of the product,\u201d Sir Malcolm wrote about GM foods in Best Served Cold, his 2013 autobiography. \u201cWe had to compete but we also had to be ethical. Our customers were mainly on a low income but they had a right to a choice.\u201d\n\nNot that he minded the publicity such moves attracted. \u201cI wasn\u2019t embarrassed to shout about them and try to turn them into a point of difference. They were certainly good for sales and our constant high profile in the media brought in new customers.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not entirely happy. If you go into our shops now, it is still a wall of plastic\n\nRichard Walker is more circumspect, saying there was no clear-cut evidence of a sales boost from the Rang-tan advert. The company also incurred significant costs by helping its suppliers remove palm oil from its ranges, at a time when it is carrying a relatively high debt load and facing challenging trading conditions. Iceland\u2019s borrowings \u2014 more than five times its earnings \u2014 stem from a leveraged buyout of the group led by Sir Malcolm in 2012. The ratio of debt to earnings is below two at all the major UK supermarkets.\n\nAn even more complex undertaking is Iceland\u2019s pledge to remove all plastic from its own-label ranges by 2023, another area where rivals have followed its lead. Plastic, which is cheap and versatile, is integral to food packaging, but the BBC\u2019s Blue Planet wildlife documentaries have raised public awareness of its environmental effects.\n\nWalker says there have been some early wins. Wrapping bananas in a cardboard girdle rather than bagging them has saved 10m plastic bags a year, for instance. \u201cWe are a fifth of the way on the journey in terms of tonnage, though I\u2019m not entirely happy. If you go into our shops now, it is still a wall of plastic,\u201d he says.\n\nWalker also admits there is a degree of contradiction in a company that owns a private jet lecturing others about environmentalism. \u201cThere are contradictions in all our lives, but I don\u2019t think the answer is to live in a cave and never fly anywhere,\u201d he says.\n\nRita Clifton, co-founder of BrandCap, a consultancy, says Iceland seemed to have overcome the \u201cradical at the research questionnaire but reactionary at the checkout\u201d situation, where customers profess strong views about an issue but fail to act on them if that would mean bearing additional costs. Last December, Wilmar, the world\u2019s largest palm oil trader, said it would improve the monitoring of its suppliers, a decision Greenpeace described as \u201ca breakthrough moment\u201d. The previous month, the RSPO had said it would commit to a no-deforestation policy.\n\nIt is impossible to know to what degree the advert influenced these changes, given that environmental organisations have lobbied food manufacturers and retailers for years to clean up their act on palm oil.\n\nClifton says it is easy to criticise the flaws in such initiatives, but adds: \u201cIf they\u2019re nudging the peanut forward in the right way, they should be encouraged as well as monitored.\u201d"

  "text": "When economic historians look back at the present era in a century or two, they might struggle to make sense of the preponderance of a particular word \u2014 one that captures the preoccupations of businesspeople in the early 21st century but is devilishly hard to pin down. That word is \u201csustainability\u201d.\n\nOf course, we all have a general sense of what sustainability refers to. For most of the history of business, it was enough that a business made a profit. As the old phrase has it, the business of business is to stay in business. Sometime in the 20th century, however, the planet got a little more crowded and it became clear that the profit motive alone might not solve every resource allocation problem. It became evident that companies had better aim for something more than just returns on capital invested. A sustainable business is one delivering on that something.\n\nWhat is it, then?\n\nPart of the answer is about social responsibility: companies should be responsive to employees as well as shareholders, should not harm our common environment, should support civic life rather than enriching tyrants, and so on. But there is more to sustainability, I would argue, than collective responsibility. It is also about what kind of profit motive drives a business. Sustainable businesses are \u201clong-term greedy\u201d: they want to generate prosperity into the distant future, not make a quick buck. And they should create positive economic externalities, not extract economic rent.\n\nDoes this all sound a bit abstract? Perhaps, but happily the seven winners of this year\u2019s FT ArcelorMittal Boldness in Business Awards provide concrete examples of what it means for a business to be sustainable in the fullest possible sense. And they show how sustainability in business requires intelligence, invention, courage and verve.\n\nWhat is required for real sustainability is, in a word, boldness.\n\nLet us start with one of the most straightforward forms of sustainability \u2014 the environmental one. Iceland Foods\u2019 commitment to radically reduce \u2014 and eventually eliminate \u2014 both palm oil from its products and plastic from its packaging is admirable enough, considered in isolation. But it also dispels one of the most pernicious myths about environmental sustainability: that it is a luxury good to be indulged in only by well-to-do consumers and the top-shelf brands that cater to them. Iceland is a value brand, but it is also an excellent business that is in a good position to take responsibility for all the external costs its operations have the potential to create.\n\nA sustainable business is one that makes whole commercial networks work better \u2014 enriching all the participants, rather than separating the winners from the losers\n\nOthers should follow its example. Bold leadership is not a luxury good, and this year\u2019s award for corporate responsibility and environment recognises that.\n\nOne of the most unfortunate facts of human nature (what we now call a \u201ccognitive bias\u201d) is the tendency to see all business situations as zero-sum. \u201cThink win-win,\u201d we are told again and again, but the point never seems to sink in. A good definition of a sustainable business is one that makes whole commercial networks work better \u2014 enriching all the participants, rather than separating the winners from the losers.\n\nThis magic is found particularly in information businesses, and this year\u2019s developing market award winner, Gro Intelligence, is an information business with immense potential. By gathering disparate sources of agricultural data, and doing the analytic work of turning the data into decision-making tools, it is set to make agriculture businesses more productive. A bold project the judges were pleased to endorse.\n\nNext comes a gritty, literal sense of sustainability: the sheer ability to stick with it. Bold businesspeople cling to their long-term vision for their business, even when short-term conditions are unfriendly.\n\nI was reminded of how hard it is for long-term-oriented businesses to stick to their guns by a comment that Warren Buffett made at a Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting. He was asked by an investor whether Berkshire\u2019s ability to buy high-quality private businesses outright would be maintained when he no longer ran the company. Business owners, the questioner suggested, are drawn to the Buffett mystique.\n\nThese opportunities had nothing to do with him, Buffett replied: owners who want to sell their businesses, but want to ensure they will be managed for the long run, have nowhere else to go. Public markets, private equity and everything in between \u2014 we live in a short-term world.\n\nOcado, the recipient of this year\u2019s technology award, has borne the full weight of the market\u2019s short-termism and come out the other side. The company and its founders endured years of pummelling from the markets as sceptics argued that a sufficient number of grocers would not adopt its technology for automating warehouses to facilitate grocery delivery, and the company would remain subscale for ever. (Full disclosure: even the FT\u2019s Lex column under my editorship sided with the sceptics. We were wrong.)\n\nOthers should follow Iceland\u2019s example. Bold leadership is not a luxury good\n\nThe company stuck to its vision and the customers did appear, in Europe and the US, sending the share price rocketing. At a moment when Britain needs a technology success story, Ocado is providing one.\n\nNext, a somewhat paradoxical meaning of sustainability: the ability to change. Fast Retailing, winner of this year\u2019s drivers of change award, has struck a remarkable balance between price and quality in its clothing. The products are inexpensive but not disposable, not meant to be worn for a season and thrown away, as many brands in the same price range are. Indeed, the quality matches that of many high-priced brands, and is forcing them to adapt.\n\nFast keeps the pressure on rivals by continuing to invest in technology and efficiency. Quality is maintained because underlying processes change.\n\nOne of the most reliable ways to win in business is to stay focused on serving a permanent and unchanging human need \u2014 especially when that requires doing things in a new way. There is no human desire more fundamental than that to eat ice cream. The entrepreneurship award this year was, for me, an easy choice. Halo Top, a business started in a lawyer\u2019s kitchen, made a place for itself in a market dominated by big, entrenched brands by delivering a low-calorie, high-protein product that was just better. Sustainable businesses, at a basic level, do not simply ensure customers pay up. They make sure those customers are happy.\n\nOf course, there may be needs that have not yet been satisfied at all, except in dreams: in a nod to this, the judges\u2019 pick for small company was Lilium, which may deliver a low-noise, no-emission air taxi \u2014 or, as it is known to the child in all of us, a flying car. A business, or a world, that stops dreaming boldly becomes unsustainable fast, after all.\n\nA final definition of sustainability is one that in my mind is the most important. Truly sustainable businesses \u2014 which, I have argued here, are all distinguished by their boldness of spirit \u2014 are operated with the recognition that some things are more important than business. There are values to which all commercial endeavours are subordinate.\n\nSir Tim Berners-Lee, our person of the year, saw how the internet, which he did so much to bring to life, was put to use for the exploitation of individuals rather than their liberation. His latest endeavour, Inrupt, is trying to redesign the web to change this, putting individuals back in charge of their own information.\n\nThe judges hope to look back, years into the future, and see that the businesses we have recognised in 2019 are still growing, innovating and striking out for new territory. Bold business is sustainable business.\n\nWinners Person of the Year: Sir Tim Berners-Lee\n\nBy designing the world wide web three decades ago, Sir Tim cemented himself as one of the most influential people of the modern era: his creation has had an incalculable impact on our everyday lives. But having grown increasingly concerned at how large interests were exploiting the web\u2019s openness \u2014 including for electoral manipulation and cyber crime \u2014 the British computer scientist designed a data platform called Solid aimed at returning ownership of data to the users who generate it. In 2018, Sir Tim launched Inrupt, a for-profit company intended to put Solid into operation, maximising the upsides of the web while minimising its downsides. The goal, in Sir Tim\u2019s words, is to \u201cgive people complete control of their data\u201d. Drivers of Change: Fast Retailing\n\nThe Japanese group, whose clothing brands include Theory, J Brand and Uniqlo, has grown to become the world\u2019s third-largest casual clothing retailer. It is investing in technology to increase efficiencies: its automation of a Japanese distribution centre enabled 24-hour operations and increased productivity 80-fold. Fast Retailing is now investing nearly $1bn to automate its warehouse and distribution operations worldwide. Corporate Responsibility/Environment: Iceland Foods\n\nThe UK retailer has long been committed to environmental campaigning, removing artificial colourings from its food in the 1980s and banning genetically modified ingredients in the 1990s. More recently, the company started two key environmental initiatives: to reduce plastic use within five years and to stop using palm oil in its own-brand products. Despite a television ban for its political content, Iceland\u2019s Christmas ad about the impact of palm oil \u2014 featuring a homeless orangutan called Rang-Tan \u2014 received millions of views online. Entrepreneurship: Halo Top\n\nIn 2011, Halo Top founder Justin Woolverton began experimenting in his kitchen to create an ice cream that satisfied his sweet tooth but contained substantially fewer calories than commercial brands. By the end of 2018, Halo Top had a hefty share of the North American market and was generating annual revenues of more than $300m. Halo Top has also started selling its low-calorie ice cream in the UK, Australia and Singapore, and continues to expand internationally. Technology: Ocado\n\nThe UK online supermarket has evolved into a technology group by selling its warehousing and ecommerce system, the Ocado Smart Platform, to other grocery retailers. In Ocado\u2019s warehouses, which are temperature-controlled to store fresh goods, robots collaborate to fetch goods and have the ability to complete a 50-item order in a few minutes. Since 2017, the company has signed deals with leading international retailers in Europe and North America. Developing Markets: Gro Intelligence\n\nFounded to provide agricultural data about Africa, Gro Intelligence has expanded to focus on global food markets. Its data help users better plan for droughts, invest in more resilient crops and make better-informed choices about loans and investments. Gro uses machine learning to model data such as future crop yields with high accuracy \u2014 recently the US Department of Agriculture revised down forecasts for US corn and soyabean production, bringing them closer to Gro\u2019s predictions. Smaller Company: Lilium\n\nThe German start-up is developing electric air taxis that will be low-noise, high-speed and emission-free. In 2017, the company completed a first test flight of its two-seater jet, which executed its signature transition from vertical to horizontal flight. The launch helped Lilium raise more than $100m in funding to develop the aircraft for commercial use. Lilium is aiming for its flying taxi service to be operational by 2025.\n\nOther nominees Drivers of Change GW Pharmaceuticals\n\nThe UK medical group was approached in 2012 by the parents of an epileptic boy to see if its cannabis-based medicine could be developed as a treatment for his seizures. In 2018, the resulting drug, Epidiolex, was the first cannabis-based medication to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Inrupt\n\nIn 2018, Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the world wide web, launched Inrupt, to enable users to take control of their personal data from big tech. Instead of allowing online services to use their Facebook or Gmail accounts to access their details, Inrupt\u2019s Solid helps users share that information themselves using a personal online data store. Just\n\nThe US food technology company makes plant-based alternatives to animal products, including Just Mayo, an egg-free mayonnaise. The group has also launched Just Egg, a vegan product with the taste and texture of scrambled eggs. Monzo\n\nThe UK digital bank was founded in 2015, aimed at providing financial services to people \u201cwho live their lives on their iPhones\u201d. Monzo is constructing a marketplace where customers can access financial services provided by partner organisations.

Revolution\n\nAOL co-founder Steve Case started venture capital group Revolution, which since 2013 has invested in innovative US companies not based in New York or California. On his annual \u201cRise of the Rest\u201d tour, Case visits start-ups across the US, and has raised more than $1bn to invest in them. Corporate Responsibility / Environment BlackRock\n\nIn 2018, the world\u2019s largest asset manager announced its commitment to \u201csustainable investing\u201d and launched exchange traded funds that prioritise social, environmental and governance factors. It estimates such ETFs will grow from $25bn to more than $400bn in the next decade. Covestro\n\nThe German company makes a compound called cardyon, used to create foam for mattresses and furniture. It can produce up to 5,000 tonnes a year of the polymer, made with 20 per cent waste carbon dioxide. Neighbourly\n\nUK-based Neighbourly is an online platform that enables companies and individuals to donate food to local charities, helping UK retailers meet a commitment to reduce food waste by 20 per cent by 2025. ReNew Power\n\nA developer and operator of wind turbines and solar panels, ReNew is India\u2019s largest clean energy producer. Last year it acquired Ostro Energy, and founder Sumant Sinha is eyeing more deals to consolidate India\u2019s fragmented renewables industry. Vindhya e-Infomedia\n\nTwo-thirds of the Indian outsourcer\u2019s staff are disabled \u2014 unusual for a country where disabled people face significant discrimination. The provider of claims processing, payroll and data management has attracted clients such as IBM, Accenture and SAP, while staff turnover is in single digits. Technology Astroscale\n\nThe Japanese company was founded in 2013 to tackle the problems posed by the estimated 750,000 pieces of debris circling the earth in space. The company\u2019s space mission ELSA-d, where a test launch will aim to capture a satellite, is scheduled for 2020. BenevolentAI\n\nThe UK medical start-up uses artificial intelligence (AI) to mine and analyse biomedical data in an effort to discover compounds for development as new medical treatments. Celonis\n\nThe German technology group\u2019s AI-driven enterprise software analyses business processes. The software takes flows of information, such as those related to invoices or logistics, and visualises it in a way that makes inefficiencies easier to spot. Darktrace\n\nThe UK cyber security company\u2019s Enterprise Immune System uses unsupervised machine learning that can establish a baseline of normal activity for any computer network and identify threats, much like the human immune system. Darktrace was valued at $1.65bn in September 2018. Oxitec\n\nThe UK biotechnology company has genetically modified mosquitoes to prevent their offspring reaching adulthood. In May 2018, Oxitec launched a pilot project in the Cayman Islands and has received funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Entrepreneurship Bulb Energy\n\nThe company was founded in 2015 to offer renewable energy without the hefty premium charged by rivals. Having raised \u00a360m of funding, it aims to supply 5m UK households within five years. Fever-Tree\n\nThe UK-based soft drinks company produces high-quality mixers. Since launching its first tonic water in 2005, it has developed a wide range and overtook Schweppes as the UK\u2019s leading mixer supplier in 2017.

Modanisa\n\nTurkish entrepreneur Kerim Ture founded Modanisa in 2011 to fill a gap in the online market for Muslim women looking for modest but fashionable clothing. It sells more than 70,000 products from 500 brands. Revolut\n\nThe financial services app offers its mostly European users international money transfers, cryptocurrency trading and fee-free currency exchange at the interbank exchange rate. The London-based company had a customer base of 2.8m by the end of 2018, and is expanding into the US and Asia. Developing Markets BYJU\u2019s\n\nIndia\u2019s largest educational tech company offers app-based learning programmes and test preparation to primary and secondary school pupils. In September 2018 it received a $100m investment for a 5 per cent stake, which it plans to use to expand internationally. CargoX\n\nThe Brazilian company\u2019s platform connects companies needing to ship goods with trucks with spare capacity.

  "authors": [
    "Filmed Petros Gioumpasis. Graphics Russell Birkett. Produced Josh De La Mare."
  ],
  "text": "This year's Spring Statement, one of chancellor's two times in the year he gives an update on the UK economy. Showed weaker growth, weaker performance in the short term but better public finances. And that left Mr Hammond able to promise goodies ahead so long as the Brexit deal was passed by the House of Commons. Let's get into some more detail.\n\nOn economic performance, on growth, the 2019 forecast has been revised down from 1.6 per cent to 1.2 per cent. That's a pretty low figure for the UK, about as bad as it's been at any time since the financial crisis. But in the subsequent years, there's been slight upward revisions leaving the economy in roughly the same position as we thought in the previous set of forecasts last October, roughly 1.5 per cent, 1.6 per cent growth a year after a slow growth year this year. 1.5 per cent - not a great number compared with Britain's historic average of about 2.5 per cent, but still not a disaster.\n\nTurning to the public finances, the news is much better. In every year of the forecast, the deficit has been revised down mostly because income tax revenues have been coming into the exchequer faster than expected. This means that we're going to have a deficit in the tens, in the teens of billions in the next few years compared with $153bn in 2009, 2010. That's just an enormous improvement we've seen in the public deficit over the past decade.\n\nHowever, that big period of high borrowing does mean that public debt has risen from around 40 per cent of national income to around 80 per cent of national income. And even though it's coming down and forecast to come down to about 73 per cent in five years' time, that is still, as far as the government is concerned, a worryingly high level of public debt. So what are the options for the chancellor. Mr Hammond?\n\nWell, it really depends on Brexit first of all. If we have a smooth Brexit, then he says he has options to decide whether to increase public spending, cut tax, or increase public investment. If we have a very messy, disruptive Brexit, he says he will have to use the better news on the public finances to mitigate the consequences of a disruptive no-deal. So that's the big immediate choice.\n\nAssuming things are rather smooth, then the question really is for the autumn, how much does Mr Hammond want to improve public services? How much is he going to end the austerity period where day-to-day public spending has been very, very, growing very much slower than it did in the past? And how much does he want to put into public investment where he's already spent a lot of money? Or will his party want tax cuts? And can he do all of this while keeping debt falling?\n\nThat's the trade-off. The more he spends, assuming Brexit goes well, the less slower debt will fall. My own view is he is a pragmatic chancellor. He will take a balanced approach. He'll do a little bit of everything. It's clear that he will increase spending on schools, police, defence - where there's real pressures at the moment. But also, he really likes public investment. He thinks infrastructure and spending money on capital projects is the way to improve the long-term growth rate of the economy.\n\nAnd Mr Hammond is still a fiscal conservative. So he will not spend so much money that in the end you don't have public debt falling. So he will be absolutely insistent that that is the constraint on how much he can spend. Public debt will still have to fall. But that does mean there should be some money left over."

Just kicking the can down the road doesn't help anybody and probably won't be acceptable to the European Union.\n\nSo we need to focus relentlessly as a House of Commons on how we are going to come together around a way forward. The prime minister's deal, in my view, is a perfectly sensible way forward. It does involve people compromising.\n\nIt doesn't give everybody exactly what they wanted. But I can predict with a high degree of certainty that the outcome of this process is going to be that an awful lot of us are not going to get exactly what we would have wanted. But we have to be mature about this and form a compromise that the House of Commons can get behind otherwise the nation can't move forward.\n\nWell, we're going to ask for a short extension to the end of June. But of course, there's no guarantee that the European Union will agree to that. As the prime minister said yesterday, the European Union has signalled that it will agree a short extension if we've reached agreement on a deal, we simply need time to legislate for it.\n\nIf we haven't reached agreement, it is quite possible the European Union will insist that we have a longer extension that would involve running European Parliament elections here. I think everybody agrees a suboptimal outcome, and another reason why my colleagues who voted against the government a couple of days ago need to think very, very hard about where we're headed."

  "text": "Retirement planning, Help to buy and ageism in society\n\nAre you ready for retirement? Claer Barrett, FT Money editor, and guests discuss the importance of financial planning - whether you're hoping to retire in 50 years or 50 weeks. Plus, first-time buyers get a boost from Help to Buy, but should the government consider aiming a tax break at the 'last-time buyers' to help more of them downsize? And finally, listeners hear from FT Money's new columnist - Jane Owen, whose debut column 'the invisible woman' rails against ageism in society."

Prime Minister.\n\nMr Speaker, these are about the choices that this House faces.\n\nThe legal default in the UK and EU law remains that the UK will leave the EU without a deal unless...\n\nUnless... unless something else is agreed.\n\nMr Speaker, I also confirmed last night that if the House declined to approve leaving without a deal on the 29th of March, 2019, the government would bring forward a motion on whether the House supports seeking to agree an extension to Article 50 with the EU, which is the logical consequence of the votes over the past two days in this House.\n\nWhile an extension of Article 50 is now inevitable, the responsibility for that extension lies solely and squarely at the prime minister's door.\n\nBut, Mr Speaker, extending Article 50 without a clear objective is not a solution. Parliament must now take control of the situation."

  "text": "We're going to be issuing an emergency order of prohibition to ground all flights of the 737 Max 8 and the 737 Max 9 and planes associated with that line. Any plane currently in the air will go to its destination and thereafter be grounded until further notice. So planes that are in the air will be grounded, if they have the 737 Max, will be grounded upon landing at the destination. Pilots have been notified. Airlines have been all notified. Airlines are agreeing with this. The safety of the American people and all people is our paramount concern.\n\nOur hearts go out to all of those who lost loved ones, to their friends, to their families in both the Ethiopian and the Lion Airlines. It's a terrible, terrible thing. Boeing is an incredible company. They are working very, very hard right now. And hopefully, they'll very quickly come up with the answer. But until they do, the planes are grounded. And you'll be hearing from the FAA directly in a little while. They're going to go into great detail as to what they found and where we're going, what we're doing. But all of those planes are grounded effective immediately, OK?"

  "authors": [

    "Parliament Tv"
  ],
  "text": "Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker. I'm acutely conscious of the fact that the House has other pressing matters on its mind today. Despite the slowing world economy the OBR expects Britain to continue to grow in every year of the forecast, at 1.2 per cent this year, with both the IMF and the OECD forecasting the UK to grow faster than Germany. Then 1.4 per cent in 2020 as forecast at the Budget and 1.6 per cent in each of the final three years.\n\nBorrowing this year will be just 1.1 per cent of GDP - \u00a33bn lower than forecast at the autumn Budget and a staggering \u00a3130bn lower than in the last year of the Labour government. Looking forward, borrowing will fall from \u00a329.3bn in 2019-20, then \u00a321.2bn, \u00a317.6bn, \u00a314.4bn, and finally \u00a313.5bn in 23-24, its lowest level in 22 years.\n\nTonight, we have a choice. We can remove the threat of an imminent no-deal exit hanging over our economy. Tomorrow, we will have the opportunity to start to map out a way forward towards building a consensus across this House for a deal we can collectively support to exit the EU in an orderly way. To a future relationship that will allow Britain to flourish, protecting jobs and businesses.\n\nA brighter future is within our grasp. Tonight, let's take a decisive step towards seizing it and building a Britain fit for the future. A Britain the next generation will be proud to call their home.\n\nWe will begin to abolish the need for paper landing cards at UK points of entry. And we will allow citizens of the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea to start using e-gates at our airports and Eurostar terminals alongside the EEA nationals who can already use them.\n\nAnd today, I can announce a new \u00a33bn affordable homes guarantee scheme to support delivery of around 30,000 affordable homes. The launch next month of the \u00a31bn Enable Build SME Guarantee Fund that I announced at Budget and \u00a3717m from the Housing Infrastructure Fund to unlock up to 37,000 new homes on sites in west London, Cheshire, Didcot, and Cambridge.\n\nI have decided to fund the provision of free sanitary products in secondary schools and colleges in England from the next school year. So the prime minister and I have decided exceptionally to make available immediately to police forces in England an additional \u00a3100m over the course of the next year, to pay for additional overtime targeted specifically on knife crime and for new violent crime reduction units to deliver a wider cross-agency response to this epidemic."

  "authors": [
    "Filmed Petros Gioumpasis. Produced Josh De La Mare."
  ],
  "text": "Profoundly great regret the decision that this house has taken tonight.\n\nSo Theresa May has just suffered what some people reckon to be the fourth biggest defeat in British political history, a defeat of 149 suggests her deal, at the very best, is on life support. So the big question is, what happens next? Now, the first thing that's going to happen today is there is going to be a vote on whether no deal should be taken off the table on March the 29th. Now, that's going to be extremely difficult to manage in the Conservative Party because Theresa May has always said that Britain will leave on March the 29th. Well plainly, we're not going to and I assume that Theresa May will vote to take no deal off the table on March the 29th.\n\nBut with an office of eurosceptics and a party that in the end we would still leave without a deal if nothing can be agreed between the UK and the EU. Now if no deal is taken off the table tonight, there'll be another series of votes tomorrow night, that's Thursday, on whether to extend the Article 50 exit process. And if so, by how long. Now Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator says he envisages a very short extension to allow the UK time to work out what on earth it is it wants to do.\n\nNow at the same time, Theresa May is somehow got to keep the show on the road with both wings of her party tearing in different directions and her trying to hold the line. After Theresa May lost the votes, she said the House of Commons now face some unenviable choices.\n\nRegrets have been taken out your hands Prime Minister.\n\nNow some of the choices could be a second referendum. I don't think that's very likely to fly at the moment. Possibly another general election. People are talking about that as well. Either of those could end up with Brexit being lost. But I think the first thing that will happen is that people across the House of Commons, in agreeing to the Labour Party, pro-european conservatives are going to start exploring totally different ways of delivering Brexit. Possibly the so-called Norway option, Norway plus, including single market, and customs union membership. Now I think it's possible that could command a majority across the House of Commons.\n\nThe bad news for Theresa May is it would tear her Conservative Party apart. It would also mean that she would rely on Labour support to get this through the House of Commons. I think if I was in Theresa May's position, I wouldn't want to put my own political future and the future of my central policy on Brexit in the hands of Jeremy Corbyn. Now, the possibility of going down a soft Brexit route, the so-called Norway route, is one way that Theresa May can exert pressure on eurosceptics on the Democratic Unionist Party to swing in behind her deal.\n\nLet me be clear--\n\nI think we could see a third meaningful vote, maybe as soon as next week to try to get the deal through, maybe even a fourth one. Because she is determined that it still will get through with the support of the conservative family, as she calls it. Now it may be a fairly dysfunctional family as we've seen vividly this week, but nevertheless, that seems to be the goal she set herself. And I wouldn't put it past her, despite everything, somehow struggling to get this deal across the line and succeeding."

  "authors": [],
  "text": "The biggest changes on the male fashion agenda this season aren\u2019t necessarily on the runway, but behind it. As part of a major reshuffle, several key fashion labels \u2013 Burberry, Dior and Louis Vuitton in particular \u2013 have new creative directors. Riccardo Tisci, previously at Givenchy, has been given the reins at Burberry; Kim Jones, formerly men\u2019s artistic director at Louis Vuitton, is now in charge of menswear at Dior, while founder of streetwear label Off-White, Virgil Abloh, has taken Jones\u2019 role at Vuitton. Each presented their first collection for spring/summer 2019, outlining their ideas and, as it turns out, turning the spotlight on the suit.\n\nThe past decade or so has seen luxury sportswear loom large on the menswear landscape. Tisci, Jones and Abloh have all played significant roles in this trajectory, which is what makes this emphasis on the suit a fashionable talking point. In their new appointments, all three showed variations of the two-piece, fusing traditional notions of tailoring with more fluid sportswear influences. Combined with fresh iterations from houses that treat the suit as a staple, such as Paul Smith and Dunhill, single- and double-breasted versions are firmly back in fashion\u2019s vernacular.\n\nAt Burberry, Tisci\u2019s first look was a seemingly classic navy pinstripe suit (jacket, \u00a31,390; trousers, \u00a3550) with a pale-blue chevron-striped shirt and tie (together \u00a3590). But on the jacket\u2019s lapel, two small crosses were discreetly stitched, while on the side of the trousers, the pinstripe morphed into a chevron design that echoed the detail on the shirt collar and tie. It was a strong, traditionally masculine statement.\n\nAt Vuitton, Abloh\u2019s opening statement was designed as a palette cleanser \u2013 he told me this himself during a preview of the collection two days before the show. A white wool/mohair double-breasted jacket (\u00a32,150) with two-pleat trousers (\u00a3835) worn with a classic white poplin shirt (\u00a3925) and white sneakers (\u00a3700) emerged on the runway.\n\nJones\u2019 first look for Dior was a double-breasted suit in off-white, the jacket (\u00a32,300) of which featured two buttons and two contrast shirting stripes: one in the sleeves, one cut into the main body of the jacket. The trousers (\u00a3590) were high-waisted and styled with sneakers (\u00a3730), striking a rather elegant line between laidback and romantic. \u201cI started with a tailoring base, then added sportswear elements and a couture finish,\u201d explains Jones of his Dior reboot, which was inspired by both Christian Dior himself and the language and legacy of his couture house. \u201cThe collection is actually really chic and elegant because that\u2019s what this maison is like. So it was taking what the house has done, which is couture and tailoring, and using that to make the new collection.\u201d In the show notes, one of the key statements revolved around men\u2019s clothes that are \u201csofter with rounded shoulders and eased shapes\u201d.\n\nJones, who studied at London\u2019s Central Saint Martins, showed his first collection at London Fashion Week in 2003 and quickly gained acclaim for his modern interpretation of the male wardrobe with a sportswear twist. In 2008, he closed the label to take the creative director role at Dunhill, where he proved to have a strong eye for fresh tailoring. In 2011, he was appointed as the style director of the men\u2019s collections at Louis Vuitton where he resided until 2018, transforming the brand into one of the most influential men\u2019s fashion labels. He brought spark by collaborating with the likes of artists the Chapman Brothers or streetwear mega-brand Supreme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCentral to the Jones-era Dior is a new suit jacket shape dubbed the Tailleur Oblique (\u00a32,200) that wraps around the body, fastening to the side with one discreet button. It appeared several times during the show, minimally styled with sneakers, in soft pink, navy and black. \u201cSuits are, of course, an integral part of our business, and Dior\u2019s is expanding,\u201d explains Jones. \u201cWe want to make customers excited about the brand. To this end, we must meet consumers\u2019 need for suits they wear to work. Meanwhile, we must open up more space for more people by offering various fashion options,\u201d he adds.\n\nTisci\u2019s tenure at Givenchy began in 2005, though it wasn\u2019t until 2008 that he took full control of menswear. Here, like Jones at Vuitton, he mined the path between tailoring and sportswear. In 2012, a Rottweiler sweatshirt became a huge hit, putting Givenchy menswear at the forefront of sports luxe. Tisci\u2019s understanding of luxury streetwear proved to be financial gold for the house, where sneakers, sweats and sportswear drove large amounts of revenue.\n\nBackstage after his Burberry debut, Tisci spoke of a need for sophistication. He said: \u201cI know we all talk about street, and I was one of the first, but we forget about sophisticated cut and Savile Row tailoring.\u201d In his show notes, the designer also underscored the notion of \u201cthe melting pot of creativity and style traditions, from the punk and rebellious, to the formal and refined, all co-existing together\u201d. This idea was demonstrated by dividing the menswear into two distinct sections, one rather refined, one more relaxed and street-inspired. Both featured suits in single- and double-breasted shapes. There was also a new style of fastening utilised on an otherwise plain two-button suit (jacket \u00a31,490; trousers \u00a3590); the top button was replaced with three silver fastenings running across the jacket\u2019s centre. Later, in the show\u2019s more laidback section, looser shapes in shades of peach or pistachio appeared, worn with sneakers and a T-shirt.\n\nAbloh, who has an MA in architecture and who worked as Kayne West\u2019s creative director before setting up Off-White in 2013, has experimented with tailoring but never to the level of luxury seen at Vuitton. Ahead of the show he talked about his desire to make a new silhouette that was not formal or street. Instead, Abloh presented a collection where the tailoring message was clear but also punchy. Aside from the opening white looks, colour was a key theme of this debut, from the rainbow-painted runway in the Palais-Royal, to a slick black double-breasted blazer (\u00a32,150) featuring cigarette-style trousers (\u00a3710) worn with a bright orange cropped top (\u00a31,300), to the overarching theme of The Wizard of Oz, which inspired prints. The main point of newness here was not necessarily the suiting per se but the wearable accessories, intended to become a new kind of layering device.\n\nOther tailoring news this season came via Celine, which introduced its first menswear collection, now under the guidance of Hedi Slimane, formerly of Dior Homme and more recently Saint Laurent. Having popularised a super-lean silhouette, Slimane\u2019s Celine debut showcased almost 50 men\u2019s looks (also available to women) which had a 1980s mood, with tailoring featuring heavily. Longer-line jackets, a neat one-button, single-breasted black jacket (\u00a31,950) and trousers (\u00a3750) and a rectangular six-button, double-breasted style (\u00a31,750) featuring a strong shoulder and \u201cnew wave\u201d trousers, (\u00a3550) with a pleat front, all marched down his Paris runway. Notably, the super-skinniness of his previous work was loosened slightly through trouser legs, though the overall look was still streamlined and fitted.\n\nElsewhere, double-breasted suits are being reimagined by labels as diverse as Versace (grey pinstripe, boxy); Dunhill (moir\u00e9 silk, elegant); Dries Van Noten (minimal, slightly roomy); and Paul Smith (long-line\u2011jackets, 1980s vibe). Van Noten says the suit forms the base of all his collections, and the rest of the clothes follow. This season, the designer worked with prints from Danish interiors designer Verner Panton that were cleverly integrated into suits with a longer line in the jacket (\u00a3882) and a roomier drape through the chest. \u201cWe used a lot of deconstructed shapes and slightly oversized, sometimes really oversized baggy pants, quite often cropped, to give the line a summer feel,\u201d explains Van Noten from his office in Antwerp. This collection was a strong suiting showcase with both minimalism and more fashion-forward moods covered. \u201cI wanted to give it [the suit] a kind of elegance, and I think short and boxy sometimes can look a little square-ish and so when you make it a slightly more elongated silhouette it gives it a nice proportion, especially when you put it with a slightly wider pair of pants,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me it was about giving the right balance of relaxed and elegant.\u201d\n\nThe Belgian designer has often championed the kind of ease in tailoring that we are seeing overall this season and is a great advocate of the double-breasted jacket. \u201cI\u2019ve always been obsessed with it,\u201d he confesses. Worn with a certain loose air, hands casually in pockets, \u201cgives a casual chicness\u201d, he says.\n\nPaul Smith is also a fan. \u201cAfter many seasons of single-breasted jackets with various numbers of buttons, it just felt right to revisit double-breasted in a confident way,\u201d he says. On the runway, this was manifested in checks (\u00a3785), strong shades such as lavender and also classic black. \u201cThe key thing is that the size of the wrap-over is less now than it was in the 1980s. This means there is less fabric across your stomach and gives a more modern look to the jacket,\u201d Smith explains from his London studio. \u201cI\u2019ve taken the boxier [\u201980s] shapes but made them relevant to today. Not quite as strong on the shoulders, not quite so much padding, but still a big, impactful shape.\u201d\n\nAt Dunhill, creative director Mark Weston, who was formerly at Burberry and Coach, has hit his stride with a certain contemporary twist on the classic idea of suiting. For his second runway show in Paris, Weston, like Smith and Van Noten, championed a longer-line jacket (\u00a31,795), often with invisible fastenings and oversized, but not boxy cuts. \u201cThe relaxed, wrapped tailoring infuses a new sinuous elegance to notions of power dressing, while split-hem trousers [\u00a3575] nod to an \u201980s casual code,\u201d explains Weston. Moir\u00e9 silk, usually used in eveningwear, is featured throughout the collection in both jackets and trousers instead of technical fabrics. On the runway, Weston\u2019s suits, like other labels including Herm\u00e8s, Dior and Van Noten, were minimally styled, sometimes with nothing worn under the blazer, a look that might catch on for a younger, experimental red-carpet crowd but is unlikely to translate in real life. However, the effect is rather clever, drawing your eye to focus more on the shape and proportions of the suit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeston\u2019s mission for the suit is to avoid anything too starchy. \u201cThere\u2019s always got to be a sense of ease to it,\u201d he says, when I ask how men should approach the suit now. Which is a pretty winning summation of the current mood in tailoring.\n\n444"

  "text": "Europe dominates the Mercer rankings as standards of living for expats slip in the US\n\nSch\u00f6nbrunn Palace in Vienna, the top-ranked city for quality of life\n\nBy Kate Youde and Alex Howlett\n\nExpats seeking the world\u2019s highest quality of life will find it in Vienna, according to new research, while Luxembourg provides the safest environment.\n\nThe Austrian capital topped the annual Quality of Living ranking from human resources consultancy Mercer for the 10th year running, while the Swiss city of Zurich took second place.\n\nIn joint third place with Munich and Auckland, Vancouver remained the highest-ranked city in North America. Singapore, placed 25th globally, led the way in Asia, while Dubai, in 74th, was the highest-ranked city in the Middle East.\n\nUruguay\u2019s capital Montevideo and Port Louis in Mauritius offer the highest quality of living in South America and Africa, respectively.\n\nMontevideo, South America\u2019s most liveable city\n\nQuality of living is determined by factors such as access to public transport, traffic congestion levels, availability of housing and international schools, and culture. Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, came bottom of the rankings.\n\nQuality of Living ranking\n\n1 Vienna, Austria\n\n2 Zurich, Switzerland\n\n3= Vancouver, Canada\n\n3= Munich, Germany\n\n3= Auckland, New Zealand\n\n6 D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany\n\n7 Frankfurt, Germany\n\n8 Copenhagen, Denmark\n\n9 Geneva, Switzerland\n\n10 Basel, Switzerland\n\nSource: Mercer\n\nAll US cities \u2014 bar New York, which rose one place to 44th as a result of its falling crime rates \u2014 dropped down the rankings this year.\n\nLondon\u2019s traffic and pollution held the city back in the rankings\n\nLondon, which remained in 41st, two places behind Paris, offers the best overall quality of living of UK cities studied. \u201cHowever, it continues to be held back by perennial problems with traffic and air pollution, and having the lowest scores in the UK for safety owing to its crime levels,\u201d says Kate Fitzpatrick, global mobility practice leader for the UK and Ireland at Mercer.\n\nLuxembourg took the title of the world\u2019s safest city\n\nLuxembourg heads Mercer\u2019s new separate personal safety ranking, which is based on cities\u2019 stability, levels of crime, law enforcement, limitations on personal freedom, relationships with other countries and freedom of the press. Swiss cities took four spots in the top 10, which is dominated by western Europe.\n\nPersonal safety ranking\n\n1 Luxembourg, Luxembourg\n\n2= Basel, Switzerland\n\n2= Bern, Switzerland\n\n2= Helsinki, Finland\n\n2= Zurich, Switzerland\n\n6 Vienna, Austria\n\n7= Geneva, Switzerland\n\n7= Oslo, Norway\n\n9= Auckland, New Zealand\n\n9= Wellington, New Zealand\n\nSource: Mercer\n\nAt 200th, Moscow was Europe\u2019s least safe city in the rankings. London was 64th, New York 55th and Paris 60th.\n\nDamascus in Syria, ranked 231st, was deemed to be the world\u2019s most dangerous city.\n\nA closer look at the top three\n\nVienna\n\nVienna\u2019s greenery is one of its most attractive features\n\nTopping Mercer\u2019s overall Quality of Living ranking for a decade, the Austrian capital, which boasts about 2,000 parks, is also one of the world\u2019s greenest cities.\n\nIts historic centre has held Unesco World Heritage status since 2001, with the horseshoe-shaped Ringstrasse boulevard home to illustrious cultural institutions such as the Vienna State Opera.\n\nDominique Meyer, director of the Vienna State Opera, recommends living in Neubau, the seventh district, near the city centre, because of its \u201cwonderful atmosphere\u201d, international mix and beautiful 18th-century architecture. \u201c It has little winding streets with pretty shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s,\u201d he says.\n\nWhat you can buy for \u00a35m\n\nLocated in the city centre a few minutes\u2019 walk from Stadtpark, this six-bedroom apartment benefits from the amenities of the adjoining hotel, including a swimming pool, fitness centre and 24-hour concierge service. Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, $6,100,000 (\u00a34,686,020).\n\nZurich\n\nResidents of Zurich have access to a wide range of outdoor pursuits\n\nResidents of the Swiss financial centre, which ranks second globally for both quality of living and safety, enjoy all-round access to the outdoors. Lake Zurich provides opportunities for swimming, sunbathing and sailing in summer, while Alpine resorts offering winter pursuits are less than two hours\u2019 drive away.\n\nChristian Spuck, director of Ballett Z\u00fcrich, enjoys living in Fluntern. \u201cThis neighbourhood is rather quiet and peaceful, so it is a perfect escape from the hectic city life,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the same time, it only takes about 10 minutes by tram to get to the city centre.\u201d\n\nHe advises against driving in Zurich or taking cabs, which are expensive. \u201cIn general, public transport is very good in Switzerland,\u201d he says. \u201cSo unless you need to go to a rather remote place, it will be faster by train, tram or bus.\u201d\n\nWhat you can buy for \u00a35m\n\nWith floor-to-ceiling windows across two storeys in the living room, this modern four-bedroom penthouse overlooks Zurich West, a former industrial area that is being transformed into one of the city\u2019s trendiest neighbourhoods. Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, price on application.\n\nVancouver\n\nVancouver was the only North American city in the overall top 10 globally\n\nVancouver, which rose from fifth to third in the overall rankings this year, has the highest quality of living in North America. It also shares top spot for safety in the region with four other Canadian cities.\n\nEnjoying a picturesque mountain-to-ocean setting, with Kitsilano beach on its shoreline and the world-class ski resort of Whistler about a two-hour drive away, residents can lead an active lifestyle. Other advantages of life in the west coast city include access to Canada\u2019s longest swimming pool and cultural institutions such as the HR MacMillan Space Centre.\n\nThe city\u2019s state-run schools are highly regarded and there are establishm ents specialising in international curricula.\n\nWhat you can buy for \u00a35m\n\nA five-bedroom house only a ten minutes drive away from the city centre, with a first floor terrace and a media room in the basement, this Vancouver property is close to several highly-ranked private schools.

  "text": "Order. Mr Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nThank you, Mr Speaker. The government has been defeated again by an enormous majority, and they must now accept their deal, their proposal, the one the prime minister's put, is clearly dead and does not have the support of this House.\n\nAnd, quite clearly no deal must be taken off the table. We've said that before, and we'll say that again. But it does mean the House has got to come together with a proposal that could be negotiated. The Labour party has put that proposal, and we will put... and we will put that proposal again, because the dangers, the dangers of what the prime minister is proposing, are basically if she carries on threatening us all with the danger of no deal, the danger of that, knowing full well the damage that will do to the British economy.\n\nThis party will put forward our proposals again, which are about a negotiated customs union, access to the market, and protection of rights. Those are the ones we'll put forward. We believe there may well be a majority for them. But there will also be the potential of negotiating them. The prime minister has run down the clock, and the clock has been run out on her. Maybe it's time instead we had a general election, and the people...\n\n...the people could choose who their government should be."

  "authors": [
    "The Editorial Board",
    "The Ft View",
    "European Union",
    "Theresa May"
  ],
  "text": "After two years of tortuous negotiations, Theresa May\u2019s strategy for taking the UK out of the EU lies in ruins. From the moment the stentorian attorney-general, Geoffrey Cox, pronounced that late legal changes won by the prime minister did not remove the risk of the UK being \u201ctrapped\u201d in the so-called Irish backstop hated by Eurosceptics, her withdrawal agreement was headed for another crushing Commons defeat. The priority now must be to avoid chaos \u2014 chaos in parliament that could be exploited by extremists of left and right, and the chaos of a no-deal exit. MPs must stabilise the political situation and create the space for a Brexit rethink.\n\nIn other circumstances, a second humiliating loss on the government\u2019s flagship policy would end in a prime ministerial resignation. Mrs May must bear most of the blame for the failure to secure a parliamentary majority. Her negotiating strategy was muddled and contradictory, and she continually put narrow party interests ahead of those of the nation. This premier, who prides herself on being no \u201cquitter\u201d, seems determined to try to soldier on. If she succeeds, against all odds, she must pursue a new strategy.\n\nThis means ending the fantasy of bringing her deal to parliament a third time. EU officials have made clear there will be no further concessions on the backstop aimed at avoiding a hard border in Ireland. Mrs May should instead allow parliament to take control. She must work to promote and facilitate exactly the kind of cross-party co-operation in the national interest that she has so far stubbornly resisted.\n\nAs a first step, MPs must vote on Wednesday to remove the risk of a catastrophic no-deal departure from the EU on March 29. Such an exit would do huge damage to UK jobs, prosperity and security. Bringing supply lines to a standstill, it could lead to shortages of foodstuffs and even medicines. It would destroy international trust in Britain when it most needs to forge new relationships.\n\nThere should be no prevarication here. Letting Britain crash out of the EU \u2014 as the Brexit ultras advocate \u2014 is not fulfilling the result of the 2016 referendum. This is not what most Leave voters thought they were backing. Failure to remove this risk would be a dereliction of parliamentarians\u2019 duty to exercise their judgment in the best interests of the citizens they represent.\n\nJoin the Europe Talks project The Financial Times is collaborating with 16 news organisations for an experiment called Europe Talks, where we connect thousands of Europeans for face-to-face conversations across borders. Would you like to be involved? Click here to find out more.\n\nMPs\u2019 second priority is to vote on Thursday to seek from the EU an extension of the Article 50 withdrawal process. This needs to be longer than three months. It should allow time for a new approach to Brexit that tests MPs\u2019 appetite for other forms of withdrawal. Indicative votes should be held on \u201csofter\u201d options including a permanent customs union with the EU \u2014 which this newspaper has supported \u2014 or a \u201cNorway-plus\u201d option of remaining in the single market and a customs union.\n\nIf no option can garner the support of a majority of MPs, the Financial Times has advocated returning the issue to the British people in another referendum. Voters could be presented with a choice between Mrs May\u2019s deal \u2014 the only negotiated Brexit option that currently exists \u2014 or remaining in the EU. MPs might favour a general election. But with Britain\u2019s two biggest political parties both riven over Brexit, an election would resolve little.\n\nA new referendum would be divisive, but it would offer voters this time a real choice, instead of the illusory Brexit they were sold in 2016. A majority does not yet appear to exist in parliament for this route, either. Yet if MPs cannot unite around an alternative Brexit, they might start to see a new plebiscite as the only way out of the impasse."

  "authors": [],
  "text": "On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I profoundly regret the decision that this House has taken tonight. I continue to believe that by far the best outcome is that the United Kingdom leaves the European Union in an orderly fashion with a deal, and that the deal we've negotiated is the best, and indeed the only, deal available. But Mr Speaker, I would like set out briefly how the government means to proceed. Two weeks ago, I made a series of commitments from this despatch box regarding the steps we would take in the event this House rejected the deal on offer. I stand by those commitments in full. Therefore, tonight we will table a motion for debate tomorrow to test whether the House supports leaving the European Union without a deal on the 29th of March.\n\nThe leader of the House will shortly make an emergency business statement confirming the change to tomorrow's business. This is an issue of grave importance for the future of our country. Just like the referendum, there are strongly held and equally legitimate views on both sides. For that reason, I can confirm that this will be a free vote on this side of the House. And I have personally struggled with this choice, as I'm sure many other honourable members will. I'm passionate about delivering the result of the referendum. But I equally passionately believe that the best way to do that is to leave in an orderly way with a deal."

  "text": "Yes. Can I say to my, honourable friend will not be surprised, given what he's heard me say from this dispatch box before. That I entirely agree with him. I believe it is absolutely imperative for this House that we meet the decision that was taken by the British people in June 2016, that we deliver on that referendum and that we deliver Brexit for the British people. And as I say, there is a danger a failure to agree a deal, that actually could end up in a situation where we have no Brexit at all."

  "authors": [

  ],
  "text": "Mr Speaker, last night in Strasbourg, the prime minister secured legally binding changes that strengthen and improve the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. The government laid three new documents reflecting these changes in the House.\n\nMr Speaker, the legal opinion I have provided to the House today focuses on the first two of these documents, which relate to the functioning of the backstop and the efforts of the parties which will be required to supersede it. Mr Speaker, let me say frankly what, in my opinion, these documents do not do. They are not about a situation where, despite the parties properly fulfilling the duties of good faith and best endeavours, they cannot reach an agreement on a future relationship. Such an event, in my opinion, is highly unlikely to occur, and it is both in the interests of the UK and the EU to agree a future relationship as quickly as possible.\n\nWere such a situation to occur, however, let me make it clear. The legal risk, as I set it out in my letter of the 13th of November, remains unchanged.\n\nHowever, the matters of law affecting withdrawal can only inform what is essentially a political decision that each of us must make. This is a question, Mr Speaker, not of the lawfulness of the government's action, but of the prudence, as a matter of policy and political judgement, of entering into an international agreement on the terms proposed."

  "title": "The elegant craftsmanship of Japanese shoemakers",
  "authors": [],
  "text": "Social media has a lot to answer for \u2013 both good and bad. For Karl Chu, of Savile Row boutique Ascot Shoes, it opened up new business opportunities. For it was social media that introduced him to Japanese shoemakers. He was immediately impressed by their near-obsessive attention to detail. \u201cWhat really stood out was the passion. Whether these craftsmen have been schooled in Japan or trained by bespoke makers in Britain, they have taken what they\u2019ve learnt and refined it to the nth degree. The sole, the upper, the finish \u2013 it\u2019s all on another level,\u201d he says.\n\nMany bespoke shoemakers operating in Japan today cater purely to the domestic market or markets close to home, holding trunk shows in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing and Singapore. But a select handful \u2013 including perhaps the most well-known, Yohei Fukuda \u2013 can be found in speciality shops in the UK, US and continental Europe such as Sweden-based online store The Sabot (which has free worldwide shipping on orders over \u00a3215, and holds regular pop-up shows around the globe) and The Armoury in New York, while others, including Masaru Okuyama and Clematis Ginza, hold regular overseas trunk shows such as those hosted biannually at Ascot Shoes, as well as the London Super Trunk Show and the Swedish Super Trunk Show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShoes by Japanese makers are almost too good to wear, says Chu. \u201cEvery time I show a pair of Japanese bespoke shoes to a customer in London, they go, \u2018Wow, they are so beautiful. I don\u2019t know if I could bear to wear them.\u2019 European bespoke shoes somehow seem more functional, whereas Japanese makers have really elevated what they do to an art form.\u201d Svelte welts, sculpted waists and perfectly pitched heels that slope gracefully inwards at the back win particular praise from connoisseurs \u2013 though each maker has their distinct style. The devotion to achieving the perfect fit is an especially attractive attribute of all Japanese shoemakers, who are painstaking in their measurements and will often make two pairs of trial fitting shoes \u2013 unheard of elsewhere \u2013 before proceeding to craft the final product.\n\nYohei Fukuda enjoys one of the highest international profiles of all Japanese shoemakers. He honed his craft with top British cordwainers Edward Green and George Cleverley and, unsurprisingly, he specialises in a classic English style, subtly dandified with distinctive flourishes such as a toe reminiscent of Cleverley\u2019s signature chisel shape. Fukuda\u2019s bespoke shoes (from about \u00a33,400) take at least 18 months from commission to delivery; made-to-order (from about \u00a31,900) take around four months; while ready-to-wear shoes (from about \u00a31,700) are considered among the most beautifully crafted off-the-shelf footwear on the market, hand-constructed to the same exacting standards as his custom offerings.\n\n\u201cIn terms of design, there are Japanese shoes inspired by Italian style, French style or English style, and those that combine elements from all of these,\u201d says Masaru Okuyama, who trained in Japan and is now based in Hong Kong. \u201cBut Japanese shoemakers refine these European styles.\u201d According to Okuyama (whose made-to\u2011order shoes start from \u00a31,600 \u2013 \u00a33,600 \u2013 with bespoke prices from \u00a33,800), Japanese shoemakers aim to refine the best footwear from around the world, and if spending 20 per cent more time is required to make the shoes five per cent better, so be it. Characteristically sleek, clean and streamlined, Okuyama\u2019s style is often likened to that of French shoemakers such as Aubercy (where, coincidentally, the in-house master bespoke shoemaker is another Japanese craftsman, Yasuhiro Shiota).\n\nKeitaro Takano, of Clematis Ginza (whose ready-to-wear shoes are priced from about \u00a31,000, and bespoke from \u00a32,400), studied with highly respected Japanese shoemaker Nobuyoshi Seki, but then integrated elements of British and European design and technique into his own approach. Fond of burnished patinas and contrasting hues and hides, Takano says Clematis Ginza has \u201ca unique aesthetic incorporating our specific mix of Japanese, English and Italian style and beautiful details such as sole designs in different colours.\u201d\n\n\u201cJapanese craftsmen make gorgeous soles,\u201d confirms George Glasgow Jr, CEO of leading British shoemaker George Cleverley, which has trained numerous Japanese artisans, including Fukuda and Marquess\u2019s Yuriko Kawaguchi. \u201cThey are very precise, highly detail\u2011oriented, and as a result we employ several Japanese craftsmen permanently. They make great shoes because they are prepared to spend a long time training and dedicate themselves to a specialism.\u201d Which is why Japanese artisans can also be found in the ateliers of other top shoemakers, such as Gaziano & Girling, John Lobb, Edward Green and Foster & Son.\n\nHowever, it is those who have trained in London and Paris and returned to Japan who are really making waves. Alongside Yohei Fukuda, another notable name to have returned is Yuki Shirahama, and both now attract an international clientele who visit their ateliers, including Simon Crompton, founder of menswear website Permanent Style. \u201cThere\u2019s an appealing humility to many Japanese shoemakers,\u201d he says. \u201cMany trained in England or France and some could now be considered superior to those they trained with, but instead of returning to Europe to compete, they want to bring those skills to Japan.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe married couple behind Marquess, Shoji and Yuriko Kawaguchi, also trained in the UK and are avid collectors of vintage British shoes, specialising in old\u2011school styles inspired by English footwear from the 1930s (exclusively bespoke, priced from about \u00a32,500). Marquess holds trunk shows at Attire House in Hong Kong, but is exploring the possibility of European appointments in the near future.\n\nAlso gaining an international reputation is Yuki Shirahama, who trained in Japan and at Altan in Paris. While his workshop is in the Japanese city of Kyoto, he also meets bespoke clients at the Strasburgo boutiques in Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka and Kyoto. His designs (bespoke only, from about \u00a32,400) are a m\u00e9lange of traditional Italian, English and French styles, though in addition to conventional cap-toes, loafers and brogues, he also offers distinctive Norwegian-style split-toe Derbies and boots.\n\nNot long ago, \u201cBeing a shoemaker in Japan was not a popular job,\u201d says Takano. But the mindset has changed and \u201cpeople think craftsmanship is cool\u201d. Okuyama agrees, \u201cIn Japan, before the economy collapsed in 1991, people just wanted to go to university and then work for one company for life. But after the bubble burst, many of my generation \u2013 \u2018the lost generation\u2019 \u2013 couldn\u2019t find a job. So we started to think, maybe just going to work and collecting your pay, that\u2019s not enough. We wanted to do something we found meaningful. It\u2019s one reason many people turned to crafts.\u201d\n\nWith the scene thriving and competition growing in Japan, \u201cMore and more Japanese makers are beginning to travel abroad to open up new markets,\u201d says Jesper Ingevaldsson, one of the organisers of the London Super Trunk Show event and 2018 World Shoemaking Championships, where several Japanese shoemakers, including Clematis Ginza and Tetsuya Shirakashi were showcased, as well as other names hopefully soon to start making waves in Europe: Kiten, Kanpekina, Matsumoto, Miyagi Kogyo and Joe Works (the latter is now available on The Sabot). \u201cWith the EU-Japan free trade agreement kicking in soon, I anticipate a big rise in makers visiting the EU,\u201d he concludes. If the shoe fits\u2026\n\n444 #"

  "text": "The prime minister and I have agreed on a joint, legally binding instrument relating to the withdrawal agreement. This instrument provides meaningful clarifications and legal guarantees on the nature of the backstop.\n\nIn politics, sometimes we'll get a second chance. It is what we do with this second chance that counts because there will be no third chance. There will be no further interpretation of the interpretations and no further assurances on the reassurances.\n\nHaving an insurance policy to guarantee that there will never be a hard border in Northern Ireland is absolutely right. It honours the UK's solemn commitments in the Belfast Good Friday Agreement. But if we ever have to use that insurance policy It cannot become a permanent arrangement, and it is not the template for our future relationship.\n\nThe deal that MPs voted on in January was not strong enough in making that clear, and legally-binding changes were needed to set that right. Today, we have agreed them.\n\nTomorrow, the House of Commons will debate the improved deal that these legal changes have created. I will speak in more detail about them when I open that debate. MPs were clear that legal changes were needed to the backstop. Today, we have secured legal changes. Now is the time to come together, to back this improved Brexit deal, and to deliver on the instruction of the British people."

  "title": "Expat advice: living in Frankfurt, Germany",
  "authors": [],
  "text": "By Olga Karnas\n\nConsultant Olga Karnas moved to Frankfurt from near Krakow in southern Poland in 2017. She lived there for a year before relocating to London in spring 2018 to work at McChrystal Group.\n\nThe Brexit-driven influx of expats continues into the hard-to-define city of Frankfurt am Main \u2014 the only German city with a North American-style, densely clustered high-rise skyline. Less posh than Munich but nothing like hipster Berlin, leafy Frankfurt is well connected and has a vibe of its own.\n\nTo make the most of the experience, learn about the city\u2019s history and find a way to live in the centre, where you will be a mere 14-minute underground train ride from a major European airport.\n\nWhile Frankfurt boasts big-city luxuries, from Chanel boutiques to Michelin-starred restaurants, it combines the allure of a medieval town with its status as a growing and ever more important financial centre. It is the only city in the world with two central banks \u2014 the European Central Bank (ECB) and the German Bundesbank.\n\nMetropolitan Frankfurt is one of the most densely populated areas of Germany, but the Taunus mountains and the Rhine valley are within an hour by train.\n\nThe Rhine valley is within an hour by train\n\nWalk round Frankfurt in the morning and you will see parents with fashionable wooden bicycle trailers, businesswomen cycling over cobblestones in heels or middle-aged men in barely fitting suits sitting in tiny Porsches.\n\nBy late afternoon in summer, people might go out to a street festival for beer and Flammkuchen (a thin, pizza-like flatbread from Alsace \u2014 tarte flamb\u00e9e in French \u2014 with Speck, or cubes of fatty bacon). In December, street food might be mulled wine and roast goose at a Christmas market.\n\nFlammkuchen is a summer street-food favourite\n\nApfelwein (apple wine, a sparkling cider that comes in dry and sweet varieties) and gr\u00fcne So\u00dfe (a green cold herb sauce served with boiled eggs and potatoes) only taste good in Frankfurt. Apfelwein Wagner in Old Sachsenhausen serves by far the best regional Apfelwein and good Schnitzel. It has a jovial atmosphere but can get very crowded with tourists and locals.\n\nFrankfurt is one of the most expensive places to live in Germany (though is cheaper than Munich), but I found restaurant prices to be 10-20 per cent lower than in London. A monthly public transport pass, at \u20ac90, is less than half the cost of an equivalent one in the UK capital \u2014 and when I lived in the German city I spent much less time commuting.\n\nGrocery prices are comparable to London, but \u2014 the best part \u2014 every supermarket stocks delicious, affordable Riesling.\n\nRents are up to 40 per cent lower than in London, but I advise negotiating your lease wisely, as there is usually a substantial notice period. If you are a student or young professional, a WG (Wohngemeinschaft, or flatshare; literally a commune), with Germans or other expats can be a fun option. A room will usually set you back \u20ac500-\u20ac800 a month, while studios start from around \u20ac1,200, and family apartments from \u20ac2,000.\n\nThe R\u00f6merberg square has a fairy-tale charm\n\nBockenheim in the west of the city, and Sachsenhausen, south of the Main river, are young, hip areas, while Ostend around the ECB is the up-and-coming but still rather industrial and rugged part of town.\n\nFor some European townhouse glamour, choose Westend, which is within walking distance of Goethe University and the city centre, and get lost in the charming alleys and many parks.\n\nFrankfurt offers plenty of places for walks and picnics by the river. Among its notable sights are the red-stone Imperial Cathedral of Saint Bartholomew; a city square (R\u00f6merberg) that looks like the Brothers Grimm just passed by; two opera houses, the Oper Frankfurt and the Alte Oper; and a vibrant main pedestrian area (Zeil).\n\nThe Alte Oper is one of the city\u2019s most prestigious cultural venues\n\nWhen I lived in Frankfurt, I enjoyed rollerblading at the ECB skatepark \u2014 yes, the bank has a skatepark \u2014 and meeting other expats for tapas or kayaking on the nearby river Lahn. There are many social media groups organising expat events.\n\nFrankfurt might be short on world-famous museums but not on big events and festivals, so keep an eye on the calendar. I went to the annual Frankfurt Book Fair, which is held each October at the Messe Frankfurt trade fair halls.\n\nFrankfurt made headlines when Goldman Sachs\u2019 chief executive Lloyd Blankfein tweeted how he liked the city. Frankfurt can surely deliver the ultimate expat experience: urban, but not a megacity; relaxed, but not quaint.\n\nWhat do you wish you had known before moving?\n\nGermany has a different debit card system (Girocard) to the UK, for example. The banks issue debit cards that are directly linked to a current account (the IBAN is printed on them). These cards do not have a CVC code, so you cannot use them for most online payments. Instead, people link a PayPal account to a current account.\n\nSome retailers say they accept cards but in fact only take Girokarten and not international Visa or Mastercard.\n\nGermany is very cash-based: street vendors and many shops and caf\u00e9s will only accept cash, or stipulate a hefty debit card minimum spend. Not many people use credit cards \u2014 according to research, there were only 0.06 credit cards per capita in 2016 \u2014 hence not many places accept them. Not coincidentally perhaps, the word Schuld in German means both debt and guilt.\n\nPhotographs: Nikolay N Antonov; Leonid Andronov; Getty Images/iStockphoto; Dreamstime; Alamy"

  "title": "The best of London\u2019s new gastro-hubs",
  "authors": [],
  "text": "Fifteen years ago, my memory dancing with wonderful meals eaten around Spain, I would sit in London tapas bars, pushing lukewarm patatas bravas around my plate, waiting for something more exciting to turn up.\n\nThankfully, it did: Brindisa opened its Borough Market site in 2004; Barrafina opened in Soho in 2007, later gaining a Michelin star. Now Brindisa\u2019s head chef Jos\u00e9 Pizarro has his own group of great restaurants; Barrafina\u2019s Nieves Barrag\u00e1n Mohacho co-runs the much-lauded Sabor; myriad other Spanish restaurants thrive; and the gospel of proper Spanish cuisine has spread throughout the city.\n\nEven unto King\u2019s Cross, and Barrafina in the shiny new Coal Drops Yard development, where executive chef Angel Zapata Martin\u2019s menu is a delight. Perch, in Barrafina fashion, at the brightly lit bar and start with a glass of house sherry \u2013 a crisp, nutty manzanilla en rama \u2013 with a few slices of mojama (wind-dried tuna) from the Atlantic coast of Spain, smartly matched with almonds and orange. Then tartare of wild seabass with (unusually but felicitously) a pur\u00e9e of Granny Smith apples tinged with ginger. Or a dish of tender espardenyes (sea cucumbers) with chicken thighs, both beautifully cooked, slathered in a warm emulsion of olive oil and sherry. And presa Ib\u00e9rica \u2013 shoulder of black pig \u2013 grilled daringly rare, and richly sauced with ajo blanco: almonds, breadcrumbs, olive oil and garlic. Every time I visit a Barrafina, there is something compelling to try: it is the hallmark of a truly creative kitchen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could say the same of the Michelin-starred A Wong, in Victoria: Andrew, the eponymous chef/proprietor, has a restless passion for taking classic Chinese dishes and giving them a modern lustre; like Barrafina, he has opened a place in one of London\u2019s new gastro-clusters, Bloomberg Arcade in the City. Called Kym\u2019s, it specialises in roast meats of the kind you see hanging in Chinatown windows: pork belly, char sui and soy chicken, collectively known as \u201cThree Treasure\u201d. All are splendid, with the crackling on the belly especially good, contrasting seductively with the silken flesh.\n\nTofu is silken too, its cool, fragile blandness beefed up with garlic soy and the faintly sulphurous tang of \u201c100 year\u201d egg. An iron skillet of pork and shrimp dumplings is topped with a riotous flurry of fried egg, black vinegar and dried chilli oil; an escalope-like \u201cTaiwanese chicken chop\u201d is scattered with curry leaves, a warmly spiced dipping sauce by its side. Wong is a chef at the top of his game.\n\nThat Coal Drops Yard and Bloomberg Arcade can attract such great restaurants shows that developers now accept that London\u2019s discerning diners won\u2019t settle for anything less. Chain trattorias and tired tapas bars will no longer suffice; actually, a dish on the new Barrafina menu sums it up: Patatas Brav\u00edsimas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n441"

  "authors": [],
  "text": "\u201cGetting up to the mountains is heaven, and Gstaad is as magical in the spring as it is in the winter, when the snow brings a blanket of glittering quiet.\n\nSaturday mornings begin with a walk to the village where I get the newspapers before heading on to Charly\u2019s coffee shop. It\u2019s been there for years and the pastries are simply amazing, but I try to resist and go for a coffee and a \u201cglow juice\u201d, made by my friend Dianne.\n\nI do a lot of walking and hiking. My husband Tommy and I like the long walk to Lauenen, where you follow a river trail through a fairytale forest. The views are never lost on me. Having worked up an appetite, we\u2019ll head to the authentic, chalet-style Hotel Wildhorn which is renowned for its decadent r\u00f6sti, the traditional Swiss potato dish that is prepared every imaginable way here. I prefer the version with ham and egg, but they\u2019re all delicious.\n\nSaturday afternoon means a massage at The Alpina hotel, where the spa is excellent. I am inspired by its understated design ethos in my own work \u2013 it makes use of rich natural materials such as Ringgenberg limestone and black onyx \u2013 and Antonis is a gifted therapist. He uses a mixture of reiki and rejuvenating therapeutic massage. From there I might pop in to see Kevin at the Palace, where the buzzy lobby lounge is perfection \u2013 for a blowdry before a night out with friends. If time allows, I\u2019ll stop by Maison Lorenz Bach, a well-edited clothing store with everything from traditional Tyrol jackets to fantastic studded belts. And Marti Interiors is a tempting source of chalet accessories, such as horn candlesticks and felt baskets that are used as log holders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the best spots on a Saturday night is at the Olden Hotel where Massimo, the ma\u00eetre d\u2019, is fantastic and the bar has a warm, convivial feel. The restaurant here is just as seductive, so we\u2019ll stay and have my favourite spaghettini sciu\u00e9 sciu\u00e9, a spicy tomato pasta.\n\nOn Sunday morning, I\u2019ll get up early to meet Alex Jenzer, a dear friend and hiking guru who knows the surrounding mountains like no one else. The sheer number of trails, as well as the epic scenery, are mindblowing. For some culture, we\u2019ll hike to one of the area\u2019s art installations such as Doug Aitken\u2019s glass house \u2013 an incredible structure made of mirrors. After all of this activity, Sunday lunch is a must, and so I\u2019ll meet my sister and brother-in-law at the Sonnenhof. We\u2019ll sit on the terrace whatever the weather, as the views are stunning. I rarely eat meat, but here they serve the steak, still sizzling, on a hot, black stone and it\u2019s exceptionally good.\n\nWe\u2019ll walk back through Saanen, where there are some super antiques stores that range from Swiss traditional to midcentury modern. Tommy has quite a sweet tooth so we\u2019ll pop into D\u00e9lice, a cake shop run by the talented Heidi Sigrist-Wehren. She made our wedding cake and is considered a true p\u00e2tisserie queen.\n\nFrom there we\u2019ll walk back along the river \u2013 usually with our dog, Rocky \u2013 before returning home to read the papers by an open fire. We\u2019ll spend Sunday nights at Seize, a very cool restaurant serving excellent mussels and light fresh soups. As the weekend draws to a close, the ski gear and hiking boots are returned to their places, my suits are packed, and I feel ready to face the busy week ahead.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n443"

  "text": "Order!\n\nIt is set to be another decisive week in Brexit, possibly the most important yet. Theresa May has pledged to bring forward a series of votes to try and move this process along. First, the prime minister is set to hold a 'meaningful vote' into her deal on Tuesday. That's the legal process for MPs to approve or reject her withdrawal package. At the moment, it looks like she's set to lose by a another decisive margin because she's yet to achieve any breakthroughs in talks with the EU.\n\nThe ayes to the right - 202. The noes to the left - 432.\n\nThe issue is the troubling Irish border backstop, that insurance policy to ensure there is never a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Talks between Brussels and the attorney-general Sir Geoffrey Cox are once again in stalemate.\n\nAnd we continue to seek legally binding changes to the backstop which ensure that it cannot be indefinite.\n\nWith that deal failing to get through, we then move to the next vote on Wednesday, when Theresa May will ask MPs whether they want to accept or reject leaving the EU without a deal. There is no obvious majority in the House of Commons for a no-deal Brexit. But many Conservative MPs are set to give it the thumbs up.\n\nOnce that has yet to get through, the prime minister has then said she will have a vote on whether to extend Brexit and move back Article 50 day. The prime minister only wants to have a short extension. But we'll have to see how MPs feel about that.\n\nThe government will on the 14th of March bring forward a motion on whether parliament wants to seek a short, limited extension to Article 50.\n\nSo where does this leave the country? There's just 18 days now until we are set to leave the EU. And there is no clarity or certainty about when we're going to leave or if we're going to leave at all or if we're going to leave with a deal."

  "text": "Thank you for your help!\n\nWhat was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nAgriculture is responsible for a large proportion of global greenhouse gas emissions, with some estimates putting its share as high as 30 per cent. One company has found an unusual way of addressing the problem: California-based Kiverdi is turning carbon dioxide into oils, proteins and other bio-based products.\n\nThe business \u2014 which uses micro\u00adorganisms to transform CO2 and other simple mineral nutrients and gases into raw materials \u2014 is among a growing number of early stage enterprises bringing a high-tech focus to a slow-moving industry and attracting growing interest from investors.\n\n\u201cThe future of food is being completely reimagined right now with a sustainable lens \u2014 and it\u2019s going to be wildly disruptive,\u201d says Daniel Epstein, chief executive and founder of Unreasonable Group, an investment firm that supports growth-stage businesses confronting global problems such as food sustainability.\n\nUnreasonable Group both invests and connects entrepreneurs with other investors. Those food companies it supports have so far raised more than $350m in aggregate, and the firm claims this total is on track to double by the end of 2019.\n\nAgri-food innovations range from alternative plant-based proteins and chemical-free fertilisers and pesticides to blockchain technologies that enhance traceability in commodity supply chains. Unreasonable Group\u2019s portfolio of companies gives some sense of the diversity of ideas.\n\nBesides Kiverdi, it has invested in businesses including Memphis Meats, which produces meat from animal cells, and Growing Underground, which has created hydroponic farms \u2014 where plants are cultivated without soil, using nutrient solutions \u2014 in second world war bunkers beneath the streets of London.\n\nThe future of food is being completely reimagined with a sustainable lens \u2014 and it will be wildly disruptive\n\nThe nature of plant cultivation and livestock rearing means entrepreneurs in the sector cannot move at the same pace as tech innovators, however.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at an annual cycle for a crop \u2014 and that\u2019s a lot longer than what can be as little as 20 minutes for an app,\u201d says Adam Anders, managing partner at Anterra Capital, an Amsterdam and Boston-based venture capital firm focused on food and agriculture. \u201cWith almost any app you get a cycle of [user] feedback in two days.\u201d\n\nFood start-ups also have to contend with long and complex supply chains in an industry that is both global and local. Moreover, domination by large global companies has until recently made transforming the system look daunting.\n\n\u201cThe food industry is so entrenched and such a significant space that it\u2019s very hard to have a large-scale disruptive intervention,\u201d says Mr Epstein.\n\nThis is changing, however. A combination of falling technology costs, recognition of the need to feed a growing global population and an expanding middle class that wants to eat more meat means the sector is ripe for change.\n\nRising awareness of the contribution of food production to climate change is also increasing pressure to find new solutions. \u201cThe old trick of just applying more herbicides or pesticides isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d says Mr Anders.\n\nAgri-food entrepreneurs are developing alternatives to traditional chemical-based inputs.\n\nFor example, Vancouver-based Terramera is creating plant-based products to be used in agriculture instead of chemical pesticides, while Pivot Bio taps into the ability of microbes to produce nitrogen to fertilise crops.\n\nAnother focus is the production of alternative meats, whether though fermentation processes such as those used to make the plant-based Impossible Burger, or by cultivating cells from animal meat, as does Memphis Meats.\n\nA desire to find more sustainable ways to feed the world\u2019s population is driving much of agri-food\u2019s entrepreneurial activity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a realisation that the food system is broken and that we need to operate within [ecological] planetary boundaries,\u201d says Rosie Wardle, head of investor engagements at Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return (FAIRR). \u201cInnovation can speed up that transition.\u201d\n\nAn initiative of the UK\u2019s Jeremy Coller Foundation, a grant-giving body focused on sustainability and ending factory farming, FAIRR is an investor network launched in 2015 to raise awareness of the financial and environmental risks of intensive livestock production.\n\nThe desire to save the planet is not the only force helping to advance entrepreneurship. A growing number of investors, from venture capital firms to food and agriculture corporations, are eyeing potential returns from funding innovations.\n\nIn 2017, the amount of funding raised globally by agri-food tech start-ups reached more than $10bn, a 29 per cent increase year-on-year, according to AgFunder, a venture capital tracker.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the first generation of real investment activity,\u201d says Mr Anders.\n\nMr Epstein sees potential for this to continue. \u201cThese will likely become multibillion-dollar companies,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you have enough knowledge and patience to not look for a fast buck, there are huge financial returns in this space.\u201d"

  "text": "Colette Browne, a London-based marketing expert, discovered in 2015 that she was suffering from prediabetes. Her blood sugar levels were high, indicating an increased risk of developing full-blown type 2 diabetes.\n\nMs Browne decided to change her diet but when looking for advice on nutrition and exercise online felt that most of what was on offer was stale and outdated. She saw a market niche and launched her own service, Sugarmedown, that mixes diet and exercise advice with an eclectic offering of music, videos and articles on fashion and cars.\n\nMany companies offer health advice online \u2014 often via smartphone apps \u2014 including calorie counters, barcode scanners, body mass index calculators, diet plans, recipes, support groups and recommendations for healthy take-out restaurants. Some combine nutritional advice with an exercise regime, others use the framework of branded diets such as Atkins, WW (formerly Weight Watchers) or South Beach Diet. \u201cThere are 237,000 diet apps in the purest sense the last time we looked,\u201d says Ms Browne.\n\nHer service works on a subscription-based model and went through a lengthy expert review process in order to make it into the app library on the NHS website. Its focus is helping people avoid added sugar. According to the World Health Organization, an average adult should consume only 10 per cent of their energy intake in the form of free sugars, or about 12 teaspoons per day. But in many western societies, people are accustomed to consuming much more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually quite hard to avoid it once you\u2019ve gotten used to to it,\u201d Ms Browne says. Users track sugar intake during the day and the smartphone screen turns red if they reach their limit.\n\nMs Browne\u2019s service is intended to encourage steady, long-term behavioural change, in line with the \u201cnudge\u201d approach proposed in the 2008 book of that name by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein. A nudge is encouraging a small change in behaviour that makes it more likely that an individual makes a certain choice.\n\nPoliticians and policymakers have embraced \u201cnudging\u201d and the approach has also found its way into a number of health technologies, including another dietary advice service called DnaNudge. The company, which employs a staff of 60 in Cambridge and London and is due to launch its product this summer, offers nutritional advice based on people\u2019s individual genetic codes.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing is looking at the relationship between medical conditions and genes,\u201d says co-founder Christofer Toumazou, professor of engineering and chief scientist for the Institute of Biomedical Engineering at Imperial College London. He cites cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity as examples. The service attempts to judge genetic propensity to these conditions and gives diet recommendations.\n\nAlgorithms generate tips that help customers make purchasing decisions\n\nConsumers have their DNA analysed by placing a saliva swab into a cartridge, which is inserted in a small machine containing biomedical chip technology. The process takes 15 minutes and is carried out in store \u2014 DnaNudge will be sold in supermarkets, department stores and a flagship outlet in London.\n\nBased on the results and the latest genetic research, algorithms generate nutritional advice that is easy to understand and helps customers make purchasing decisions. They can use a barcode scanning app or a wristband to find out whether a food product is suitable, indicated by a green or red light. The app also proposes alternative, healthier food choices in the same product category \u2014 a less sugary tin of tomato soup, for example.\n\nSeveral companies offer diet advice based on people\u2019s genetic codes, but not everyone is convinced and the premise is disputed by some scientists.\n\n\u201cIn nearly all cases, there is not enough scientific evidence yet to give nutritional advice based on your genome,\u201d says Lawrence Brody, director of the division of genomics and society at the National Human Genome Research Institute in the US, and an expert on genetics and nutrition.\n\nOnly with a few rare conditions such as phenylketonuria, an inherited metabolic disorder that can lead to slow mental development and seizures, has it been possible to develop scientifically tested diet plans based on genetics.\n\nGiving this type of advice to the general population is much more difficult given that food metabolism is complex and research studies in the field often produce varied and unforeseen results. Mr Brody gives the example of vitamin E, a fat-soluble antioxidant that is supposed to have beneficial effects for a variety of disorders such as cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Several large studies have been undertaken to test these effects, but so far, results have been inconclusive.\n\n\u201cWe have been surprised many times before when the logical intervention did not work or even turned out to be harmful,\u201d Mr Brody says."

  "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nThere are many aspects of the Japanese diet that help explain the longevity of the country\u2019s citizens, not least the dominance of vegetables and grains over saturated fats and processed foods. One less frequently discussed characteristic with broad benefits is its variety.\n\nWhen a Japanese friend was a child, her family taught that a day\u2019s meals should contain 25 ingredients, colours and textures. Not only was her diet interesting and healthy; it also reflected and supported a more balanced food production system for the country.\n\nAround the world, food habits are heading in the opposite direction. Over-consumption is matched by narrower, standardised, industrialised and inappropriate choices. While 1bn people go hungry around the globe, twice that number eat too much of the wrong food.\n\nAnecdotes abound of houses in which dining areas for family meals and conversation \u2014 and even the kitchens \u2014 have gone. Adults and children gobble takeaways in separate sessions on sofas in front of smartphones.\n\nBasic cooking knowledge has waned: \u201chome economics\u201d has been abandoned in primary schools; courses in catering focus on theory and health and safety but are slower to mobilise students to actually cook. The rising number of TV cookery shows seems in inverse proportion to the time that people spend in the kitchen. Consumers in richer countries (including many of society\u2019s poorest) eat out more and spend more on ready-made meals high in salt, additives and packaging.\n\nThat is partly a side effect of a positive trend, with the rise of women who have more economic opportunities and less time and social pressure to spend unpaid hours shopping and cooking. It is also a consequence of an intensifying cycle of \u201cfast\u201d food in every sense.\n\nThese patterns have consequences, as processed and industrialised foods increase the risk of heart disease, cancer and other ailments \u2014 factors that are starting to reverse gains in life expectancy in countries led by the US. A study of about 45,000 French residents over nearly a decade showed a link between processed food and mortality.\n\nA Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems estimated in January that unhealthy diets account for up to 11m avoidable premature deaths globally each year, posing a greater risk of illness and death than unsafe sex, alcohol, drugs and tobacco combined.\n\nFood production practices also have implications for the planet, contributing to climate change and chemical pollution. Agriculture accounts for 40 per cent of global land use, 30 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions and 70 per cent of freshwater use. That includes much unnecessary production, given substantial food waste.\n\nDemands for food and particular diets are reliant on a small number of products, squeezing biodiversity and creating fresh vulnerabilities. Natural ecosystems are being converted to cropland and pasture, threatening wild species; nitrogen and phosphorus in cultivation are killing aquatic life.\n\nA report last month from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization highlighted that 40 types of livestock provided the majority of milk, meat and eggs for humans, with many other species at risk. From more than 14,000 edible plant species, only 150-200 are used by humans and just three \u2014 rice, wheat and maize \u2014 account for 60 per cent of all calories consumed by humans. Disease could create serious supply problems.\n\nClimate change is set to cut production in low latitudes, and by some estimates causes an average 8 per cent reduction in yields across Africa and south Asia by 2050. It is being exacerbated by agricultural practices.\n\nYet as urbanisation increases, humans are also increasingly losing their link to rural areas and farming, becoming ever more unaware of the impacts of their growing demands for food, the methods used and the damage done.\n\nReversing course will not be easy. Governments and regulators must play a more interventionist role, from investment in basic education and encouragement of cooking and better nutrition, to tougher regulation of advertising for unhealthy foods and taxes on unhealthy ingredients.\n\nThe price of food should reflect its true costs, including the wider environmental burden of current production methods. Public institutions \u2014 including offices, schools and hospitals \u2014 should set an example with healthier meals for staff and visitors.\n\nAgri-food companies need to invest in forms of production that are more intensive but less damaging to biodiversity. There needs to be substantial investment in new varieties that are more resistant to climate change. Restaurants and supermarkets also need to cut waste, including through suitable portion sizes.\n\nPeople must also take responsibility, shifting away from meat and dairy, adapting tastes, cutting down on waste and appreciating the value of \u201cslow food\u201d by cooking and eating together.\n\nWithout more imaginative, varied diets and other ways to eat more healthily, as the Lancet Commission concludes, we will end up diet-poor and planet-poor. How about that for a conversation around the family dinner table over a freshly cooked meal?\n\nAndrew Jack is FT global education editor"

  "text": "At Food-X, a New York City-based food industry accelerator, the only culinary equipment to be seen is the sink, coffee maker and refrigerator used for the day\u2019s drinks and snacks. But while it might not have a test kitchen, the support Food-X offers to agri-food entrepreneurs is different to that found at accelerators for biotech or software start-ups.\n\nFood-X is part of a fast growing cohort of accelerators launching to support the entrepreneurs now hoping to disrupt the global agri-food industry. The nature of agriculture and food production means they need specific types of support. Like most accelerators Food-X offers start-up capital, mentoring, access to food companies, investors and press, shared space and alumni networks, but the programme is tailored to the sector.\n\n\u201cOn the food product side, it\u2019s about distribution, branding, co-packing, production and supply chain,\u201d says Peter Bodenheimer, Food-X programme director. He adds that relationships with institutions such as the Rutgers Food Innovation Center mean it can offer access to research and development facilities and test kitchens if needed.\n\n\u201cIn tech, it\u2019s much more about capital and building a product right than it is about the supply chain,\u201d he says. \u201cFor food companies, it\u2019s about building the process up to allow for scale.\u201d\n\nStart-up capital is, nevertheless, an essential ingredient. \u201cInitially funding is a major concern,\u201d says Mark Lyons, chief executive and president of Alltech, a US animal feed and crop nutrition company that runs the Pearse Lyons Accelerator for agri-tech start-ups.\n\nHe says founders are also looking for opportunities to learn what customers want, expertise to develop business plans and for coaching on delivering a pitch and managing a business.\n\nThe start-ups in accelerator programmes are diverse. At Food-X, the 2018 cohort ranges from Saana, a customised meal delivery service for people suffering from serious illnesses such as cancer, to Planetarians, an ingredient company creating an affordable alternative protein from the matter left after oil is extracted from sunflower seeds.\n\nThe 10 start-ups selected to join the Pearse Lyons accelerator this year include the UK\u2019s Breedr, an app that enables livestock farmers to share data to increase yields, quality and profits, and US-based business Biome Makers, whose technology measures crop health and biodiversity using DNA and intelligent computing.\n\nAccelerators offer a range of investment models, support services, physical spaces and timeframes. At Food-X, which invests in its start-ups, the 14-week programme length is important.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s too long, you remove some of the pressure,\u201d says Mr Bodenheimer. \u201cPart of our goal is to create a sense of urgency and help people move forward more quickly, start to test things and get feedback \u2014 and hopefully they\u2019ll come out of the programme with momentum they can continue to build on.\u201d\n\nEarly stage companies are not the only focus for accelerators. The Terra accelerator in San Francisco is something of a matchmaker. It brings together large corporations that are looking for innovations to work with \u201cscale-ups\u201d on three-month pilots.\n\n\u201cThese are start-ups that have raised a certain level of funding, already have product market fit and traction . . . and are able to scale,\u201d says programme director Shaina Silva. Terra\u2019s co-founders are Rabobank, a Dutch lender which specialises in agribusiness, and RocketSpace, which provides workspace for tech entrepreneurs, start-ups and corporate professionals.\n\nFor large companies that find it hard to innovate, Terra is a way of outsourcing research and development. \u201cWhere they would have spent billions on research and development on something that might have failed, you spend a few hundred thousand dollars and you might have a solution that works in a few short months,\u201d says Ms Silva.\n\nAnother approach to speeding up innovation is to create a competition. This is the model for FoodShot Global, a non-profit consortium of venture funds, banks, corporations, universities and foundations. The annual award was launched last year alongside an investment platform offering entrepreneurs $10m a year in equity and up to $20m in debt funding. The award of more than $500,000 will go to entrepreneurs, researchers and others whose ideas FoodShot believes could accelerate the transformation of the food system.\n\nThe inaugural prize focuses on innovations that address soil deterioration. \u201cWe started with soil because we felt that all the changes we\u2019re looking to make will need soil health to be fixed first,\u201d says Victor Friedberg, FoodShot Global\u2019s chairman and founder.\n\nWhile the models vary, the impetus to create new forms of support for entrepreneurs is rooted in a drive toward sustainability. \u201cWe have a growing population and a lot of issues in food and agriculture that are affecting our planet,\u201d says Ms Silva. \u201cWe have to find ways of putting innovation in the market that will not take decades.\u201d"

  "text": "As sugary foods proliferated and obesity ballooned in Chile in recent decades, health campaigners clamoured for a solution. Now the government is implementing one of the most radical junk food fights ever seen, using a model that reformers hope will spread elsewhere.\n\nThe country intensified its legal battle against big sugar five years ago, with the introduction of an 18 per cent tax on high-sugar drinks. In 2016 it went further and targeted child-friendly marketing. A new law limits cartoon food packaging, stops schools selling unhealthy foods, restricts TV adverts, bans promotional toys and mandates large black cigarette-style warning labels on foods high in salt, saturated fat, sugar and calories.\n\n\u201cIf you change food habits you can really reduce heart attacks, cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure,\u201d says Senator Guido Girardi, a doctor and former president of Chile\u2019s Senate, who has been pushing for the new laws for more than a decade. \u201cChile is an experimental lab for these policies.\u201d\n\nEarly analyses suggest the campaign is working. New labels have cut the likelihood of people choosing sugary breakfast cereals by 11 per cent and sugary juices by almost 24 per cent, according to 2018 estimates by University of Chile researchers. Monthly consumption of targeted sugary drinks fell by almost 22 per cent after the tax started in 2014, according to a paper by academics at the UK\u2019s University of York working with colleagues at the University of Chile.\n\n\u201cOur results suggest an overall reduction of sugar consumption after the implementation of the tax in Chile,\u201d says Crist\u00f3bal Cuadrado Nahum, professor of public health at the University of Chile and a co-author, adding that other countries should \u201ctake heart\u201d. \u201cFrom a public health perspective, even a small reduction in sugar intake . . . could lead to significant health gains.\u201d\n\nSince the 1990s, as Chile industrialised, sugary and packaged foods flooded in, which Dr Girardi blames for a big rise in obesity, diet-related illness and deaths. Chileans consume more sugary drinks per capita than any other country, according to 2015 research published in The Lancet medical journal.\n\nWith industrialisation, sugary and packaged foods flooded in, which were blamed for rising obesity\n\nTaxes on unhealthy foods are proliferating as countries from Mexico and Hungary to Thailand and the UK battle obesity. Some are coupled with incentives, such as Philadelphia\u2019s sweet drinks tax, introduced in the US city in June 2016 with a promise to redirect money to public initiatives including free early childcare centres and community schools.\n\n\u201cThere has been a domino effect on the sugary drinks taxes and those dominoes are continuing to fall [as countries follow others],\u201d says Prof Corinna Hawkes, director of the Centre for Food Policy at City, University of London.\n\nTaxes alone will not be enough to curb health problems. Last month Prof Hawkes co-authored a report with dozens of international diet experts calling for a global treaty to regulate unhealthy foods, redirect subsidies away from red meat and corn and increase taxes in a bid to shift consumer behaviour towards healthier, less polluting foods.\n\n\u201cThis is an aspirational goal,\u201d says William Dietz, an obesity expert and professor of public health at George Washington University and a co-author of the report. \u201cWe are under no illusion that getting there will be easy.\u201d\n\nHe cites Chile as an example of how governments can combine taxes with strong regulations to try to change demand, limit the political influence of big food companies and push them to redesign products with fewer unhealthy ingredients.\n\nTaxes often disproportionately affect poorer communities, Prof Dietz notes. Yet obesity-related illnesses are also much more prevalent among the poor, who stand to benefit from those taxes. He calls for such taxes to be combined with subsidies on healthier foods and international regulations to restrict marketing \u2014 along the lines of those in Chile.\n\nMeanwhile in Santiago, Chile\u2019s capital, the regulatory fight goes on. Later this year will see a lowering of the threshold where sugar, salt, calories or fat require a black label on packets. Senator Girardi is campaigning for compulsory free water in restaurants and schools, to discourage drinking sugary alternatives, as well as fruit and vegetables subsidies.\n\nThe senator says he is already seeing increased interest from other countries in Latin America, including Uruguay and Peru, but also further afield, like Canada. He believes it will be easier to get legal changes in many Latin American countries because \u201cthe big food companies\u2019 lobbies are not as strong as in Europe and the US\u201d. Nevertheless he is hopeful that ongoing experiments on his continent will inform policy elsewhere.\n\n\u201cI believe that if other Latin American countries manage to pass these laws [and people see the results], eventually they will become mandatory around the world,\u201d he says."

  "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nEntrepreneurs and investors are increasingly focusing on algae as an alternative protein source to help feed a global population that the UN forecasts will rise from 7.7bn today to 9.7bn by 2050.\n\nIn the EU, the algae biomass sector is valued at \u20ac1.69bn and employs 14,000 people in research and development and the supply chain, according to a 2018 European Commission report. \u201cThe increased inclusion of algae in western diets could help fill some of the food production needs associated with expected human population growth,\u201d the report notes.\n\n\u201cIt is very exciting and extremely valuable,\u201d says Fredrik Adams, a cleantech entrepreneur who has worked on renewable energy and algae projects for almost a decade. His latest company, Firglas, is on the verge of producing algae as a food ingredient on a wholesale level. The business is building two large-scale commercial plants in Spain and the Netherlands and plans to produce \u201ctens of tonnes of dry matter\u201d later this year. It will grow algae in closed photobioreactor systems containing water and salt, allowing year-round production.\n\nProduction is fast and environmentally friendly, Mr Adams says, because algae photosynthesise, releasing oxygen into the atmosphere. The challenge is to reduce the cost so the ingredient appeals to food manufacturers and consumers.\n\n\u201cThis type of production has been used for decades for pharma and cosmetic uses,\u201d he adds, noting that L\u2019Or\u00e9al is the leading global patent holder for algae. \u201cWhat we\u2019d like to do is . . . step up in scale and achieve a lower unit price and take that to food markets.\u201d\n\nKent-based algae producer AlgaeCytes is looking to follow suit, also planning to build a closed-system plant. \u201cOur aim by 2020 is to produce 200 tonnes of algae-based protein [a year],\u201d says Naz Bashir, chief executive (pictured above).\n\nBright future: A technician takes samples at AlgaeCytes \u00a9 David Parry /FT\n\nNorthern European entrepreneurs are leading the way with expertise in algae. Last year Corbion, an Amsterdam-based ingredients supplier, announced plans to roll out its algae cooking oil to more than 2,000 Walmart stores in the US.\n\nEntrepreneurs recognise that persuading consumers to try algae may be difficult and take time. The development of mycoprotein derived from fungus began in Petri dishes in the 1960s, yet Quorn, the now-popular meat substitute brand, first sold the ingredient to UK customers more than 25 years later.\n\nQuorn\u2019s 1995 advertising campaign featured the footballer Ryan Giggs and Mr Adams says such celebrity endorsement may help propel algae to the mass market. \u201cPart of this will be dictated by fashion, all sort of whims,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m expecting consumers will go through learning and education, just like they did for sushi.\u201d\n\nThe ingredient comes out of production as a \u201csludge\u201d but is commonly used in dried powder form. \u201cThat has to be mixed into other food to make things like fishcakes or algae burgers . . . so you get a meat-like substance,\u201d says Mr Adams.\n\nProcessing the dried algae \u00a9 David Parry /FT\n\nCompanies hope that algae\u2019s nutritional benefits will be a strong selling point. Currently, algae oil and supplements can be bought online and from health food stores. The omega 3 fatty acid in algae oil is attractive for vegans since it is often otherwise found in oily fish. Entrepreneurs want to broaden the use of the ingredient from supplements to staple foods.\n\n\u201cBecause the world\u2019s population is on a very dramatic increase, we do need to have a sustainable means of producing these omega 3 oils,\u201d says Mr Bashir.\n\nSustainability is becoming a greater concern for consumers; in 2017, delivery service Just Eat reported a 987 per cent rise in demand for vegetarian options in Ireland alone, for example. As more consumers become concerned about environmental impact and increasingly renounce meat, Mr Bashir believes algae will become an important source of protein.\n\nInvestors have noted growing demand for alternative proteins. Data from start-up research company Beauhurst shows that the amount of money raised by private UK companies that either produce or use seaweed or algae in food and drinks has risen by almost 2,000 per cent in the past eight years. In 2011, three deals raised a total of \u00a3314,200 while in 2018, seven deals raised \u00a36.4m.\n\nIn December, Firglas raised \u00a33m through Wealth Club, a London investment platform for experienced investors. Alex Davies, founder of Wealth Club, sees Firglas as an attractive opportunity because \u201cpeople need to be fed\u201d.\n\nConsumers will go through learning and education, just like they did for sushi\n\nBesides use in consumer food, algae could have a significant role in fish farming. The global fish feed market is expected to reach $214bn by 2024, according to market research company Global Market Insights. Mr Davies describes the market as \u201cdying for other sources of fish feed\u201d, presenting an opportunity to feed fish with algae.\n\nDespite investment in algae production increasing, he admits that it is \u201ccurrently very difficult to produce it at scale and on commercially viable terms\u201d. Investors in the 24 companies listed on Beauhurst have yet to see a return.\n\nTo make algae a sustainable and attractive alternative protein source, says Mr Adams, \u201cscaling up and driving down the unit cost of production is fundamental\u201d."

  "title": "Why the future of gene-edited foods is in the balance",
  "authors": [

    "Food"
  ],
  "text": "Gene editing is the biggest technical advance in bioscience since the discovery of \u201crecombinant DNA\u201d technology \u2014 artificially mixing genetic material \u2014 in 1973. That launched the era of genetic engineering and led to the commercialisation of genetically modified (GM) crops in the 1990s. Now gene editing (GE) is for the first time giving researchers a fast, reliable way to make precise changes in specific genes. But its use in farming is in the balance after a European ruling last year equated it with heavily regulated GM.\n\nPublicity around gene \u2014 or genome \u2014 editing has focused on human applications, and particularly the controversy about gene-edited babies born in China. Yet it also promises to transform agricultural production, for example genetically editing crops to make them resistant to disease or developing faster-growing varieties of livestock. The extent of that transformation will depend on variations in regulation around the world.\n\nProponents of gene editing hope it can avoid the criticism and regulatory scrutiny that slowed the introduction of GM, because it usually alters existing genes rather than adding foreign DNA to the plant. In the US and Canada, the initial response of authorities has been that gene-edited crops will not fall under the regulatory regime of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) but the EU is taking a different view.\n\nScientists have devised several gene editing tools but the most popular and versatile is Crispr (\u201cclustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats\u201d, pronounced \u201ccrisper\u201d), which entered the world\u2019s laboratories six years ago.\n\nThe method exploits molecular machinery that bacteria evolved to fight viral infection. There are two parts. The first, Crispr itself, is a molecule that can be guided to any stretch of DNA. The second part is an enzyme called Cas9 that cuts the gene in the targeted location. Then researchers can remove unwanted DNA, knock out a gene to stop it working, tweak it to change its function, or regulate genetic activity.\n\nMore difficult to achieve through gene editing \u2014 and less common so far \u2014 is the reliable addition of brand new genes from other species, as in GM. For example Paul South of the University of Illinois in the US, who leads a team working to boost the photosynthetic efficiency of plants and increase crop yields, says his \u201csynthetic biology\u201d project required extensive DNA rearrangements that could not be achieved solely via Crispr.\n\nHowever researchers are making progress with what Prof Jonathan Jones of the Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich, UK, calls \u201cknock-in breeding\u201d through Crispr \u2014 inserting a new gene in a location opened up in the organism\u2019s DNA.\n\nThe distinction between gene editing and GM could be crucial for the way regulators treat crops produced with the two technologies. Plant biologists such as Prof Jones argue that creating new varieties through GE is closer to non-genetic processes. (These might include conventional mutagenesis in which chemicals are used to change an organism\u2019s DNA without inserting new genes.) Therefore, the scientists say, the plants should not have to pass through as many regulatory hoops as new GM varieties.\n\nThe issue is particularly important in Europe, which has lagged far behind north and Latin America in licensing GM crops, mainly because of stronger consumer and political resistance. Opponents have objected to the potential impact of genetically altered crops both on the environment, by altering the ecological balance that sustains wildlife, and on human health. The only two GM crops that have made it through the approvals process for commercial cultivation in the EU are insect-resistant maize developed by Monsanto, approved in 1998, and a potato with altered starch qualities developed by BASF, approved in 2010.\n\nScientists\u2019 hopes that the EU would take a more liberal attitude to GE were dashed last July when the European Court of Justice ruled gene-edited crops should be subject to the same stringent regulations as GMOs.\n\n\u201cThis ruling closes the door to many beneficial genetic modifications such as breeding of disease-resistant plants that require much less pesticide input,\u201d says Sophien Kamoun, another senior scientist at the Sainsbury Lab. \u201cA sad day for European plant science.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of Europe has lost the benefits of GMOs,\u201d agrees Liam Condon, head of crop science at Bayer. \u201cWe are at risk of losing again in Europe with gene editing, though there is a much broader alliance behind it than there was with GM.\u201d\n\n2 GM crops approved by EU for commercial cultivation\n\nBut some legal and regulatory experts say the ECJ ruling may not be as far-reaching as plant scientists fear. \u201cIf the ECJ ruling were to be interpreted to mean that all genome-edited organisms are by definition GMOs, then this would \u2014 apart from the impact on innovation \u2014 result in unenforceable regulation,\u201d says Piet van der Meer, who was closely involved in the development of EU GMO regulations. \u201cHowever, I believe that the ECJ ruling requires further clarification to understand what it actually means.\u201d\n\nGene editing could accelerate the adoption of gene technology in farm animals. The only GM animal licensed for human food is Atlantic salmon with two genes added from other fish to make it grow bigger and faster. It has been on sale in Canada since 2017. AquaBounty, the company behind the GM salmon, has now gene edited tilapia fish to produce a faster-growing farmed variety. It is not yet on sale, though Argentina has ruled that it is exempt from GM regulation.\n\nMeanwhile Edinburgh university\u2019s Roslin Institute, a leading UK animal biotech laboratory, is working on GE poultry projects. A collaboration with Wendy Barclay, virology professor at Imperial College London, aims to make influenza-resistant chickens as a buffer to the spread of avian flu to humans. \u201cIf we could prevent viruses crossing from wild birds into chickens, we would stop the next pandemic at source,\u201d she says.\n\n1 A salmon variety is the only GM animal approved for human food\n\nOther Roslin GE projects include hens that do not produce their own chicks, for use as surrogates to lay eggs from rare breeds, and others that produce human proteins in their eggs for medical purposes. Roslin is also working with Genus, the UK animal genetics company, to produce pigs resistant to the virus that causes Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), one of the costliest animal diseases. Elsewhere, Recombinetics, a US gene editing company, is developing \u201cpolled\u201d cattle that do not grow horns, which could end the practice of removing horns from calves.\n\nResearchers at several institutions are working to use Crispr to enable the sex determination of farm animals, which would be particularly useful in the dairy and chicken sectors where male calves and chicks are not wanted.\n\n\u201cIt would have a huge impact on the industry if you could generate single-sex offspring while maintaining the overall efficiency of reproduction, but no one has managed to do it so far,\u201d says Bruce Whitelaw, Roslin\u2019s professor of animal biotechnology."

  "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nWhile only a tiny proportion of the world\u2019s agricultural land is devoted to organic farming, some argue that it punches above its weight in contributing to more sustainable farming practices.\n\n\u201cIts influence goes far beyond the 1 per cent of land that is managed organically,\u201d says Verena Seufert, assistant professor at the Institute for Environmental Studies at VU University Amsterdam. \u201cIt is influencing the debate by highlighting food sustainability and how big an impact the food we eat has on many of our environmental problems,\u201d she says.\n\nYet while some believe that organic agriculture could play a bigger role in helping feed the world, environmental advocates see it as one option in a number of more sustainable approaches to farming.\n\nFarming that is certified as organic or Fairtrade can contribute to sustainable development by helping smallholders in poor rural areas to improve farm management and access training to increase the quality of what they produce.\n\nThe International Food Research Policy Institute found that, globally, farmers who participate in such certification schemes are 30 to 33 percentage points more likely to receive training and support services from agricultural extension officers (and 46 percentage points in households headed by women).\n\nOrganic approaches such as nutrient recycling (which uses organic waste as a fertiliser) are also important in parts of the world where producers cannot afford conventional agricultural inputs.\n\n\u201cIn Africa, farmers are organic by default because they don\u2019t have access to chemicals,\u201d says Michelle Deugd, director of agriculture at the Rainforest Alliance. \u201cIn those circumstances, the organic approach allows farmers to make optimum use of the nutrients available in their systems.\u201d\n\nWhile organic is unlikely to become a dominant form of agriculture, in some countries it is occupying greater proportions of farmland. It accounts for more than 10 per cent of agricultural land in 11 countries \u2014 including Austria, Italy, Czech Republic and Finland \u2014 according to FiBL, an organic research institute.\n\nMeanwhile, sales of organic food have been gathering pace. Market research group Ecovia Intelligence estimates the global market for organic food at $97bn. Retailers have responded. From 2006, for example, Walmart started offering more organic food in its stores.\n\nThis is also true in Latin America, says Ivette Perfecto, a University of Michigan professor of ecology, natural resources and environment whose recent work has focused on Mexico and Puerto Rico. \u201cEspecially in the bigger cities, you see an increase in the amount of food that is certified organic in the supermarkets,\u201d she says. \u201cTen to 15 years ago that was unheard of in Latin America.\u201d\n\nIncreasing the amount of organic farming is not easy, particularly for smallholders in developing countries. \u201cOne of the difficulties of scaling up organic farming is that it\u2019s very knowledge intensive,\u201d says Ms Deugd.\n\nIn some cases, organic agriculture may be less efficient than conventional systems. \u201cThe performance of organic is quite varied,\u201d says Prof Seufert. \u201cFor example, we think organic agriculture uses less nitrogen fertiliser but it\u2019s not necessarily more nitrogen efficient because it has lower yields.\u201d\n\nIn a paper she worked on in 2017, comparisons of the performance of organic farming with conventional equivalents found that organic yielded 19 to 25 per cent less produce. The study discovered that organic farms performed worse than conventional ones on some environmental factors, for example because lower yields could lead to damaging land clearance.\n\nIts influence goes far beyond the 1 per cent of land managed organically\n\nYet the picture is complex, says Prof Seufert. The research also found that organic farming creates greater biodiversity \u2014 more bees, birds and butterflies \u2014 and higher soil and water quality, and also emits less greenhouse gases.\n\nProf Perfecto points out that even if yields are lower for individual crops, smallholder farmers who use organic systems often grow a number of additional plants \u2014 from coffee to beans, squash or fruit trees \u2014 on the same land, increasing its overall productivity.\n\n\u201cIf you compare maize production in organic versus non-organic fields, the organic fields might show a reduced yield. But farmers are producing other things,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is food as well.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, interest is growing in agroecology, which combines traditional farming with scientific knowledge and focuses on the interactions between plants, animals, humans and the environment. Last year, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization launched an initiative designed to scale up agroecology to help meet the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nMs Deugd argues that organic farming is one element in this broader approach, which includes many of its practices and principles but without necessarily being certified as organic. \u201cThere are sustainable farming options where moderate use of agro-chemicals can increase productivity and still be sustainable,\u201d she says. \u201c[Organic] is one of the options and it\u2019s relevant, but it\u2019s not the sole solution.\u201d"

  "text": "We're on the verge of a farming robot revolution. Investors poured $700m into agricultural technology in 2017 alone. But are farm bots ready to deliver? We came to Leckford Estate in the south of England to see how one start-up is working to change the face of farming.\n\nSo this is Tom, our monitoring robot. At the moment, we're in a trials phase. So Tom is looking at the wheat crop that we have here and gathering data on it, so analysing where the weeds are, looking at the health status of that plant, so looking at any disease issues, nutrient issues. Where he's just taking high quality digital images top down at the moment. And that goes into Wilma, who's our AI.\n\nWilma's artificial intelligence matches the images to precise GPS data, generating a map that's accurate to within two centimetres. The farmer can then zoom right in on specific plants, potentially isolating problems before they can spread. For Andrew Hoad, the head of Leckford Estate, it's a game changer.\n\nLeckford Estate is a 4,000-acre estate, that's about 1,800 hectares. With such a large area, we can't realistically cover every part of the estate. So having a bit of machinery that is in a field, able to tell us in real time what is going on enables us to be much more responsive and be more precise about what we are doing.\n\nThe technology still has a way to go. The Tom prototype struggles to cover some of the farm's more rugged terrain. And in its current form, it can't even go out in the rain. But for Andrew, exploiting the data from Tom and Wilma could mean lower costs and a kinder of impact the environment.\n\nLike any farm, we are facing into higher energy costs. Conventional farming also relies heavily on inputs. And the ability to be able to have very targeted interventions that will reduce the amount of physical things that need to go into the crop - because you've got that visibility of that single plant - will mean that actually there's potentially the opportunity - I think from the research that the Small Robot Company have done - to take out about 60 per cent of the input cost. Now, that's not just a cost thing. That's a really good thing for the environment.\n\nThat kind of payoff will only be possible if farmers replace their tractors and combines with a new breed of technology. Smart bots, light and nimble enough to seed, weed, and feed individual plants without damaging others in the same field. For a Small Robot Company, this is the next phase.\n\nLooking at Harry here, you will notice that Harry has the capacity not just to carry a boom for planting, but also another boom underneath for electric weeding, or another boom underneath for some clever way of being able to kill pests, which doesn't need chemicals. We are a starting point to allow all sorts of clever technologies to be applied for arable farmers.\n\nMoving past this starting point will take innovation and funding, both of which may be harder to come by, given the low unit value of the staple crops, like wheat and soy, that this bot is designed for.\n\nWhere we're going to really drive the large increases in food production at a sustainable level is going to happen is in arable. And there, unfortunately, there is much less interest because from a start-up perspective, the value is less, which means we've got a much longer journey to be able to get there.\n\nSmall Robot Company may still be years from delivering on the full potential of farm bots. But if their bots can replace the heavy machinery of today's large scale farming, they could change the industry and the landscape beyond recognition."

And, according to a Business in the Community report just 14 per cent disclose problems to their line manager or human resources department.\n\n\u201cIt is saddening to see the \u2018men don\u2019t cry\u2019 portrayal of masculinity still preventing thousands of men from talking about their distress and accessing support,\u201d the study says. The fact that two-fifths of men sought no support from anyone during the most recent occurrence of a mental health issue indicates that there are significant improvements to be made.\n\nHow then can employers, especially those with male-dominated workforces, best approach this mental health gender gap?\n\nSimon Blake is chief executive of Mental Health First Aid England, the main provider of workplace training. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a cultural context against which often men don\u2019t ask for help until they\u2019re at crisis point,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that Mental Health First Aid . . . shifts that culture . . . to a place where it is seen as brave and strong to ask for help at the point at which you need it.\u201d\n\nLee Woolcott-Ellis is one of the campaigners helping drive that change. A victim of 1970s child sexual abuse \u2014 chronicled in his memoir A Childhood Not Easily Forgotten \u2014 he is mental health co-ordinator at Southeastern, a train operator with an 81 per cent male workforce, where he has put his own experience to good use by developing a mental health advocacy programme.\n\nWorkplaces need to take a whole-life approach\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve been in an abusive relationship or you\u2019ve lived with abuse you recognise it in others,\u201d he says.

I asked for help when I got there, and, thankfully, I came out the other side, which really was the precursor to what we\u2019re doing now.\u201d\n\nUnderlying causes of mental ill-health are not normally as harrowing as those experienced by Mr Woolcott-Ellis. The usual culprits are the big life changes such as bereavement or divorce, but tipping points can come from everyday events at work.\n\n\u201cSometimes it can be just the silliest little thing, or it could be an assault at work or someone being particularly unpleasant and enough to push someone over the edge,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe point is echoed by Poppy Jaman, chief executive of the City Mental Health Alliance. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found in the City is that people will have a whole load of stuff that\u2019s going on in their life \u2014 and work will be the thing that just tips them over . . . Workplaces need to take a whole-life approach.\u201d\n\nLondon\u2019s financial industry has historically been a very alpha-male environment where men in senior roles are reluctant to talk about mental health issues in case they are seen as less powerful says Ms Jaman.\n\n\u201cWe raise boys and men not to cry, not to show emotions. That is amplified further when you\u2019re working in a high-pressure sector which is incredibly competitive.\u201d\n\nConstruction is a male-dominated industry whose mental health statistics make grim reading: The risk of suicide among labourers is three times higher than the national average; work-related stress, depression and anxiety are estimated to cost building companies \u00a3178m a year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re renowned as tough guys,\u201d says Martin Coyd, a volunteer with Building Mental Health, a construction industry initiative and the head of health, safety and wellbeing at Mace Construction, one of the UK\u2019s biggest building firms. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about things that are perceived as weakness. What\u2019s recognised now is those that do, actually have huge courage.\u201d\n\nShaun Davis is global director of safety, health, wellbeing and sustainability at Royal Mail \u2014 another mainly male environment \u2014 and author of Positive Male Mind. \u201cWe\u2019re not expecting our managers to be clinicians and \u2018fix\u2019 their people, because that\u2019s not what their role is. Their role is to help, support and signpost,\u201d he explains. Peer-to-peer networks are also vital, he says.\n\nA common thread for these mental health advocates is the importance of the line manager as a first port of call for distressed staff. The problem, says Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at Manchester Business School, is that too often, managers get their jobs because of their technical abilities rather than people skills. Companies should instead \u201crecruit the ones that have good emotional intelligence\u201d, he argues.\n\n\u201cPublic health interventions which aim to change the resilience and mental fitness of a group only work if the organisation\u2019s managers are signed up,\u201d says Professor Neil Greenberg, Royal College of Psychiatrists Chair for Occupational Psychiatry.\n\nThe economic argument for addressing mental ill-health in the workplace is compelling. Thriving at Work, a 2017 report for the UK government, put the costs to the economy of poor mental health as high as \u00a399bn a year.\n\nIs the tide turning? Ms Jaman certainly thinks so: \u201cIn the last six years I have seen more men in the City come out and talk about their mental health experience than ever before\u201d.\n\nThe feeling is echoed by Mr Woolcott-Ellis: \u201cThere is now a movement of openness and we are seeing people come forward. It\u2019s definitely changing, there\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d"

  "title": "Five reasons to live in Marina del Rey, Los Angeles",
  "authors": [],
  "text": "By Jonathan Smith\n\nThe district of Marina del Rey in Los Angeles, California, offers a relaxed Pacific Coast waterfront location with convenient links to the rest of the city.\n\nAccess all areas\n\nLiving in a quietly upmarket residential area does not mean you have to be stuck out in the suburbs. Marina del Rey is a 30-minute stroll along the seafront to the beach action of Venice, not to mention the myriad shops, galleries and eateries in this coolest of districts.\n\nSanta Monica is further away, but still only 20 minutes by bicycle thanks to the Marvin Braude Bike Trail, also known as The Strand, a 22-mile paved route that takes in some of the best of LA\u2019s coastline and is almost entirely traffic-free.\n\nRunning from Pacific Palisades in the north to Torrance Beach in the south, the only point where the route leaves the beach and joins the road is to take a short detour around Marina del Rey.\n\nThe beachfront city of Santa Monica is a 20-minute bike ride away\n\nBy car, LA\u2019s rejuvenated Downtown is 30 to 60 minutes away, depending on traffic. And Marina del Rey is less than 20 minutes from Los Angeles International Airport.\n\nDowntown Los Angeles is easily reachable by car\n\nSail away\n\nThose lucky enough to have their own vessel can choose from numerous yacht clubs at Marina del Rey, including Del Rey Yacht Club, California Yacht Club, Santa Monica Windjammers YC and Pacific Mariners YC. Newbies can learn to sail at Bluewater Sailing school, while for more casual adventures there is a range of boat charters and cruises from various outfits on Fiji Way, including Marina Del Rey Sportfishing.\n\nFor something different, Marina del Rey Parasailing takes passengers 800ft in the air, while Paddle Method offers stand-up paddle-board lessons and rentals. Romantics dreaming of the original Venice can even take a tour with Gondolas D\u2019Amore.\n\nBoat-owners will find a well-developed infrastructure in Marina del Rey\n\nFood with a view\n\nResidents are spoilt for choice when it comes to restaurants overlooking the water. Beachside, Tony P\u2019s Dockside Grill and Chart House (known for its lobster) all specialise in seafood. Cafe Del Rey is far from cheap but gets rave reviews for its cuisine, polished service and outstanding views of the marina. For international flavours try Sapori Italian Restaurant or Sugarfish by Sushi Nozawa.\n\nSushi at Sugarfish by Sushi Nozawa\n\nSunny outlook\n\nLos Angeles enjoys an average of 3,254 hours of sunshine each year \u2014 about twice as many as London or Paris, and a full 700 hours more than New York or Rome. Marina del Rey is on a south-west-facing part of the city\u2019s coastal strip, making it easy to take advantage of the rays. Many town houses have roof terraces that are perfect for sunset watching and evening drinks.\n\nMarina del Rey gets an average of almost nine hours of sunshine a day\n\nInvestment potential\n\nMarina del Ray is not a cheap district but compares favourably with other prime coastal areas of the city. The median price of homes listed at the end of November 2018 was $1,222,628 for the Marina del Rey postal area, according to real estate database Zillow, compared with $2,075,000 for neighbouring Venice and $1,699,000 for Santa Monica.\n\nThe median home value was $1,089,700, up 8.7 per cent year on year. Zillow predicts values in Marina del Rey will grow 6.3 per cent in the 12 months from November, outpacing the 4.3 per cent gain forecast for both Venice and Santa Monica.\n\nSanta Monica, where house price growth is forecast to trail Marina del Rey in 2019\n\nPhotographs: Alamy; Getty Images/iStockphoto"

  "text": "Several years into the US's fight with Huawei, the Chinese telecoms equipment manufacturer is fighting back. This week, Huawei announced it is suing the US government over the government's ban on Huawei equipment being sold to its agencies or contractors. Washington says the equipment could be used by Beijing for spying. But Huawei says the ban is unconstitutional, as it singles it out for punishment without there having been a trial.\n\nSo could Huawei win? Precedent suggests not. Last year, a judge here dismissed a very similar case brought by the Russian company Kaspersky Lab, arguing that the US was justified in seeking to protect its own national interest. If that's the case, why is Huawei bringing this at all?\n\nOne explanation is that it is simply seeking to embarrass the US government. If this case gets beyond a motion to dismiss, it could demand all kinds of documents and even deposition from US officials. That could cause a major headache for the American intelligence services.\n\nBut if that is its strategy, it's not without risk. If the case does get that far, the American government will be able to demand the same of Huawei, including any sensitive information it might hold about its links with the Chinese government. I don't expect the case to get very far. But if it does, expect fireworks."

Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nToo many organisations in global health are failing to address imbalances in pay and leadership and doing too little to tackle sexual harassment of women, who make up 70 per cent of the workforce.\n\nThat is the conclusion of Global Health 50/50's annual audit of gender inequality. The greatest discrepancies are at the top: seven out of ten executive heads and board chairs are men. They also earn 13.5 per cent more.\n\n\u201cThe global health sector stands for fairness and universality, and strives to ensure health for everyone, particularly the most marginalised . . . If there is one sector that should set precedent in this space, it is global health,\u201d says Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand prime minister, introducing the report.\n\nOther reports marking International Women's Day catalogued problems facing women outside the workplace, from the \u201cforgotten emergency\u201d of unsafe abortion \u2014 one of the main causes of maternal mortality \u2014 to stigmas around menstruation. \u201cMenstruating girls can even be banished to outside sheds where they suffer in cold and isolation, often at risk of illness and animal attacks,\u201d UN experts said.\n\nDespite some positive contributions \u2014 such as the UK's commitment to end global \u201cperiod poverty\u201d by 2030 \u2014 there is still a long way to go before women across the world have the rights to control their own bodies, including sexual and reproductive rights, without interference.\n\nFT special report: Women in business\n\nRegister here to receive FT Health for free by email each week\n\nChartwatch\n\nChild mortality The number of under-fives dying each year has more than halved in recent decades thanks to progress in preventing infectious diseases.

(FT)\n\nAids breakthrough A man treated in the UK became only the second person ever to go into remission from HIV after a stem cell transplant, raising hopes of progress in finding a cure. A long-lasting injection treatment has passed late-stage trials. Here's a timeline summarising 30 years of the fight against the virus. (FT, Nature, WHO)\n\nVaccination and measles New research confirms that there is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism. The vaccine actually has some unexpected benefits. Vaccination is a social contract between the public and its government, says a prominent commentator. Facebook announced a crackdown on misinformation. Just ten countries accounted for three quarters of the total increase in measles in 2018. (Annals of Internal Medicine, NPR, Foreign Policy, FT, Unicef)\n\n\n\nAfrica health A biennial conference on African health discussed the barriers to achieving universal health coverage. Some 11m Africans are pushed into poverty every year due to medical expenses. Sweeping reforms in Mali promise free healthcare to pregnant women and under-5s. Another success story is Haiti's battle against HIV. (AHAIC, Devex, Guardian, Lancet)\n\nWHO reforms There was a mixed reaction to WHO plans to reform its bureaucracy. The organisation hopes the revamp will help it achieve its five-year targets of a billion more people with universal health coverage, a billion more better protected from health emergencies, and a billion more with better health and wellbeing. (NYT, WHO, Devex)\n\nFDA chief quits Scott Gottlieb unexpectedly announced he was quitting as head of the US Food and Drug Administration. He had used his job to tackle many public health problems, including young people becoming addicted to nicotine. Biotech and tobacco companies alike are nervous about who will replace him. (FT, Politico, Washington Post, Stat)\n\nDengue drama The Philippines government is set to charge six employees at Sanofi, the French pharma company, as well as health officials, over more than 10 deaths that prosecutors claim are linked to its Dengvaxia vaccine, used in the world's first mass immunisation programme against dengue. (FT)\n\nEthics and genetics China has set up a national ethics committee to oversee high-risk biomedical technologies and new regulations on gene editing in humans following the furore over the \u201cCrispr babies\u201d incident. Does gene editing increase inequality?

  "text": "I started off in radio. From there I moved in to television. I went to MTV. What was really interesting for me was when I started at MTV not only was I one of the only working class people there, I was, to begin with, the only person of colour...only woman of colour there.\n\nI'd from a TV background, so I use fashion analogies. But I look at gender as almost wearing a coat that's just a bit too tight. And it's just slightly uncomfortable. You just know that there's a coat that's a little bit more comfortable, that would fit easier in terms of how you are treated. Racism, I would say, is coming into a room in a jacket that is seen as the completely wrong colour. There's nothing wrong with the jacket. You like it. You think it's great. But everybody else reacts in such a hostile way to that jacket that you're wearing.\n\nIs that literally how you feel?\n\nYes. And it feels very differently. That's why, for me, it's really important to have an intersectual conversation. Because the way I'm treated as a woman is very different to the way I'm treated because I'm black. They feel very different. And you know which form of discrimination you're experiencing because of the way it feels.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd I think it's really important to make sure that others also understand that.\n\nYou would know more about this than me in that you've been studying gender and reporting on gender for such a long time. And I think what's interesting about the #MeToo movement - and I'd love to hear your opinion on it, too - is, of course, it's a moment of reckoning in that women are making sure that their voices are heard. They are expressing painful emotions that have been suppressed for so long. And I think that, you know, like with any shift - if you look at the civil rights movement - it was similar in the sense that when we started really calling out this level of injustice, racial injustice, it was a real reckoning.\n\nIt seems to me we've had this huge cultural shift.\n\nYes, which is great.\n\nWhich has been terrific.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut when it comes to actual real economic, financial, and political change...\n\nWhat is that? So I spent some time with Alan Smith, your data visualisation editor. And I was shocked by the data that he showed me.\n\nAlan, hello.\n\nHi, June. Nice to see you.\n\nNice to see you. So Alan, you are our man in the know when it comes to data.\n\nSo on this axis here, we're going to show what is the gap. So in the middle means there's no pay gap at all between men and women. In this direction is when you're paying men more. So at this level, you're paying men 50 per cent more than women.\n\nThat would be women being paid 50 per cent more. But what the data has shown us is that actually over three-quarters of companies that did report paid men more than women.\n\nWow.\n\nSo these are all the companies that are reporting a pay gap in favour of men.\n\nOh, my goodness.\n\nAnd you can see that that's a sizeable number.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo it's a big proportion. And what really completes this graphic, obviously, is do you want to see the companies that are paying women more, June?\n\nYes.\n\nThere they are. So there is a gap.\n\nThere is a huge difference.\n\nAnd what we're really looking at in this chart is just the lack of symmetry.\n\nYeah. And even the ones where we're getting to the 50 per cent mark, that's still worrying.\n\nThat's a big gap.\n\nThat's a huge gap.\n\nThat's a big gap.\n\nWe spoke with... I spoke with Ann Pickering from Telef\u00f3nica, 02. They have just managed, I think as of last year, their board is 50/50, which is wonderful. But that was something that she said was not easy. She literally had to be very clear with her executive search firms to say, do not send me a list that does not have 50 per cent women, 50 per cent men. And, wait for this. Some of them recused themselves.\n\nSo I found myself as the other...\n\nYes.\n\nI was the only woman in the room. And much as my male colleagues were a delight, I, metaphorically, I lost my voice. So that's when I realised how important diversity was. The penny dropped for me at that point. So when the opportunity arose to recruit additional people to the exec team, I would only work with a search firm that would be happy recruiting a 50/50 gender balance shortlist.\n\nRight, so you stipulated that.\n\nI stipulated that. You would be surprised, June, at the number of search firms who were uncomfortable with that request. So we didn't tend to work with them going forward. So for me, it's all about creating a level playing field. And I don't believe in quotas.\n\nOK.\n\nSo 50/50 gender balance shortlist, and then we chose the best person, who happened to be female. So it really does bring diversity of thinking. Yeah, we're all very different. So much better quality of debate in the board room, much broader range of views. Fantastic to have four role models for the women in our business. And I make sure that they get out there and they talk to our female colleagues. That's really, really important.\n\nWe filmed the roundtable with six key business leaders. And they all had different views on how you actually create change, and how you make sure that it's long lasting. And it was interesting, because Helena Morrissey doesn't believe in quotas even though the 30% Club kind of is a quota system, isn't it? That's kind of the whole point of it. But she doesn't believe in quotas, whereas Shriti Vadera and Karen Blackett believe that you need to have some sort of clear metric. You need to know what it is that you're working towards.\n\nI think the easier task, dare I say it, is women on boards.\n\nDefinitely.\n\nI think the more difficult one is senior women at the executive level...\n\nExecutive level, yeah.\n\n...rather than at the non-executive level, which by the way, is the source of the pay gap.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nThe representation of that. And I think that I worry a little bit that the exclusive issue of a focus on board level has actually also taken women out of executive positions into going portfolio possibly a little earlier. And I think we really need to focus on women and being at the executive...\n\nAt the executive level.\n\nSenior executive level.\n\nAnd also on the executive committees, as well, which is key. Yeah.\n\nThe executive committees. Not just the CEO or the finance writer who might be on the board...\n\nYeah.\n\n...but in the levels below. Because that's the talent pipeline. That's the future.\n\nYeah.\n\nIn our office, something that we we're always talking about is too much male energy.\n\nAnd so we have a sort of male energy measure in our office. And that's because we've made sure that the teams are equalised and that thing. But we try to make sure that all the teams that are working never become one gender. That's something that we've been watching, that actually when teams start to aggregate into the same gender, even when there's diversity in it, it starts to produce a certain kind of culture. And it actually affects the entire mood of the entire office.\n\nIt does.\n\nSomething that's been really important to us is how the micro team actually are organised and starts to dissolve that. Because then that kind of bonding agendas start to become much more soft.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd they don't just become male orientated or male interest only. They become soft and they become shared. And then that starts to have an effect. Because then when you start to see that kind of different team leaders winning there's a kind of idea that it's not about that one thing. You know? And it's something... we can tell with my leadership team when we've hit the male energy...\n\n...metre. We're like, what just happened? OK. Can somebody do the numbers? Oh, my god. We have more men in the office than women.\n\nDo you think there's a fine line between role model and exceptionalism?\n\nIt's a tough one.\n\nBecause, you know, I always sort of say...\n\nThat's a great point.\n\n...that we'll know that we've kind of really got to success when there are as many mediocre...\n\nCorrect.\n\n...women in charge of companies as there are mediocre men.\n\nThat's great.\n\n-- in charge of companies. Because it's so easy, isn't it?\n\nTotally agree.\n\nI just wrote something about this.\n\nBecause it's interesting, around International Women's Day in particular, I often do start to feel slightly exhausted. Because one is constantly being bombarded with all of these stories about these magnificent women, who are indeed magnificent.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut it reinforces the idea that to get ahead, you have to be so much nicer, better, brilliant, more generous, more ethical, more everything.\n\nEverything.\n\nAnd it's exhausting.\n\nIt's exhausting.\n\nWho wants to keep thinking about this?\n\nYes.\n\nYou just want to get on with it.\n\nYeah. And you want to be mediocre.\n\nWell...\n\nIf it's okay for the man to be mediocre, why can't we be mediocre, too, now and again?\n\nThat is exactly what I said. You know, we must fight for the right to be as useless as anybody else.\n\nAnd this is the way that true equality lasts.\n\nParental leave, let's look at parental leave. How we look at parental leave, in the first place. In the roundtable this came up a lot. And a lot of the mothers on the panel talked about their problems that they had had in their career.\n\nAnd I think one of the most significant things we've done in 02 is run a career returners' programme.\n\nHow does that work?\n\nSo we brought women back into the workplace who've been out typically between two and 10 years, primarily having family, bringing them back on a 12-week course. And it's just all about giving them the opportunity to develop their self-confidence. You know, I can remember, it was many years ago, June, when I had my children. But you're off for months. And you really forget about the world of work. So giving women the opportunity to come back as part of a cohort, so they all join at the same time. Giving them a mentor, giving them a coach, and allowing them to come back into the workforce around about 12 weeks to develop their self-confidence.\n\nWhen we started Net-a-Porter, the first, I would say, 10 employees were actually dominant with male. Because we had IT, accounting, CFO. That's kind of natural at this stage. Quickly, we started to get more and more females in the company, because it's a female company. The audience is female. My reason was, OK, having two people to employ a woman or male... most of the employees were young. So you deal with finding talent. And when you find talent, you want to keep it. That talent, female, has to go on maternity leave. And it's a huge challenge for a young company when you find the talent, to actually find a replacement of that talent.\n\nAnd after 10 years, we were like, 3,500 employees. 2,500 were women. Out of these 2,500 women, you always have 50, 60 pregnant women. And actually, that kind of maternity hub we had at the company was actually a great way for us to find new talents. When you grow a company, number one, the woman being pregnant, most of the time that's 95 per cent Of the time what's coming back to the company. So effectively, you don't lose your talent. But more importantly, we had this hub of replacements who were there to support for three month, four months. We test them, and actually they were, for us, an amazing skill we had. They could be like, one... to replace someone in the accounting department. Actually, she would go into the magazine department.\n\nWow.\n\nSo effectively, that created amazing assets.\n\nIt became a training programme, almost.\n\nTotally. And actually, that' season for me, it really changed my vision on actually hiring young women. It is actually an amazing asset.\n\nYes. It is.\n\nI always talk about me loudly. So I'm a single mum to an 8-year old boy.\n\nWho is fabulous.\n\nThank you. I was promoted to be CEO of an operating company 10 months after having him.\n\nWow. What was that like?\n\nLook. I'm not going to lie. It was something I'd always wanted. But, my god, I was thinking, how am I going to do this? But I set my stall out. So I had conversations with my boss. I had conversations with clients about I am going to be more productive than I ever have been. I'm just going to work in a different way. And I think, again, it's about that conversation of normalising this.\n\nAnd how have you designed how you work? Because I think this is really important, particularly for women in the world of work, women who are mothers.\n\nYeah.\n\nUntil we get to the place where men are treated the same in terms of paternity, this is something we really have to look at for women. How did you design that?\n\nI talk about work-life blend rather than work-life balance. Because work is life and life is work. And you've got to know how to blend the two. And I am fortunate that I can have some help with childcare. I'm out of the office by 6 o'clock.\n\nOn the dot.\n\nI'm out of the office and I'm gone. And there will be a blackout window between 6 o'clock and 8 o'clock where I'm all focused on my son. And then after 8 o'clock I will answer emails. But I think the point about leaving loudly was, look, I am putting my spikes on and Lycra to compete in my son's sports race.\n\nAnd, I literally--\n\nYou're competitive.\n\nVery.\n\nIncredibly. And I will say what I'm doing. Because I think when you try and not talk about it and you try and hide it, it becomes something like a guilty secret. And it shouldn't be. It's part of your life.\n\nSpeaking of progression, one thing that we are really looking at a lot is promotion and searching out for the right candidates, and just thinking more broadly about that across industries. This whole idea of building up a pipeline is something that I know people spend a lot of time thinking about. And to me, it just seems like a no brainer. I mean, of course you have to have a strong\n\nOf course.\n\n...of women.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou can really start to paint this picture that there is something happening to decelerate the careers of women.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I'm going to, again, look at the proportion of women. Firstly, what we asked these organisations to report on is by their kind of seniority. So if we look at the junior staff in these same organisations that we looked at just a minute ago...\n\nBefore, yeah.\n\n...actually, junior levels are far more likely to be occupied by women.\n\nYup.\n\nBut then as you progress through the company's organisational structures, at middle management there's already a shift.\n\nShift. It's...\n\nIt's male dominated.\n\n...straight away. So there's some... because often when you look at people that report and work in this space, often they say it's the middle area is where the problem happens, in that women don't progress from the middle to the sort of C-suite. But actually, your data suggest it's actually happening here before we even get to the middle level.\n\nYeah. There is clearly something happening that's changing the gender structure between junior and middle levels. And, of course, you can guess. If I'd ask you to point on the screen where do you think the senior level customer is going to be...\n\n...you know, there's no surprise.\n\nNo surprise.\n\nAll the way over there in the corner.\n\nAll the way over there.\n\nAnd so I think what we're sort of seeing here is, again, just more reinforcement that there are some... you know, the data's great showing us the symptoms, if you like, of what's going on.\n\nBut I think this is really important. Because up until now, sort of the general thinking has been that women get stuck at the middle level. And so for companies wanting to address this problem, they're looking at the wrong place for the problem. This is suggesting we need to start much earlier...\n\nThat's right.\n\n...in the company pipeline.\n\nAnd so setting out things like the management of expectation for career pathways right from those junior levels, incredibly important. Now how companies react to this has been extremely interesting to watch. Because I think with the first wave of gender pay gap reporting, there was a suspicion that lot of companies were waiting until the very last moment to report their pay gap data, so that it would get lost in an avalanche of similarly bad pay gaps.\n\nSo many of them. We're not so bad. Look at them.\n\nBut there were a few companies that took an exception to that approach. One of them was easyJet, which did report a very big gender pay gap.\n\nRight.\n\nBut it reported it early on...\n\nYes.\n\n...and made a very big announcement, which was...\n\nAnnouncement that they were going to address it.\n\nWell, they effectively said, a lot of our pilots who are well-paid are male. And we're going to introduce a new recruitment programme...\n\nFor women.\n\n...specifically for recruiting female pilots. And so they took what could have been interpreted as a very negative press story about having a wide pay gap...\n\nAnd came up with a solution straight away.\n\nAnd turned up into something that I think generated far more positivity for them. We've taken a big look at specifically, finance. And I think finance is one where you look at how does that compare to the pay gap, overall. So we've still got the same axis here on this chart.\n\nYup.\n\nStill looking at the pay gap.\n\nYeah.\n\nThis time, we're going to look at the percentage of companies...\n\nThat are paying men more.\n\n..in the sector. Because they're all obviously different size industries, and so on. Now this line shows us the chart that we were really just looking at, which is all companies. okay? So that's that asymmetrical shape that we were just looking at. In finance, there's far fewer companies with no pay gap.\n\nWith no pay gap.\n\nThe proportion of companies with no pay gap is much smaller.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd if you look at the proportion of companies that are paying men more, that's what that looks like within finance.\n\nAnd what about paying women more?\n\nWell, you're going to have to get your magnifying glass out, because there's only a very few. And none of these... none of these companies here are actually what you would call big finance companies. It really is important to know with this data what you can and can't do. So, for example, we don't know how many employees there are in any of these companies, other than the fact...\n\nThat there's at least 250.\n\n...that there's at least 250. And they can report, companies, how many employees they have in an overall band. But it's not comprehensive enough. Some of our colleagues here have linked this data to other data on the size of companies. And what that reveals is actually about nine in 10 women will work for a company that pays men more. That's the figure.\n\nIs that just for finance, so that's across the board?\n\nThat's across the board, overall.\n\nNine in 10?\n\nNine in 10. So it's really interesting, this. Because...\n\nWhen you put it like that, it's even worse than it seems.\n\nBecause when we sort of around the figure off, we're sort of saying 14 per cent, whatever the current figure is at the moment. But actually when you put it like that, it just sounds terrible. Nine in 10.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo without question, the majority of women in this country will work for a business that pays men more.\n\nAbsolutely. Without doubt. And this is the first time that we've really been able to say that based on an extensive data set that gives us a snapshot of that.\n\nThat's a reality.\n\nWe need more women in finance.\n\nYes.\n\nOr more diversity in finance.\n\nYes.\n\nDiversity in finance is the issue. Diversity in finance.\n\nI think that finance is a big issue.\n\nYeah.\n\nI think that tech and fintech...\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nAnd I feel really bad about this. Because it's almost like, these are the start-ups. Fintech is the kind of blank sheet. You don't have to have a history of unconscious bias, or anything else. And then you have technology companies that are worse.\n\nWorse.\n\nWorse, much worse.\n\nBut there's an interesting point here, a kind of paradox, which I don't really understand. You could not find a business, around this table or more broadly, that wouldn't agree with the proposition, what's your greatest asset in your business?\n\nPeople.\n\nMy people.\n\nYour people, right? So how much reporting of your people characteristics goes on? Not very much. I mean, it shouldn't have taken the government to come in with legislation to require that to be disclosed.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know, it's quite hard to price what you can't manage, or what you can't measure.\n\nAnd what you can't measure. Yeah.\n\nI think there's a lot further we can go. You're starting with gender, which has been a great start, through ethnicity, and more broadly...\n\nAnd disability, and across the board.\n\nAnd then you've got a vehicle for investors to be able to shine a spotlight on these things.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd indeed, regulators. And absolutely, that needs to be thought about and reported and recorded, not just to your regulator, but to your investor.\n\nWhich is why I was saying at the start , the important thing is linking that measurement at the team levels into performance at the team levels. Because at the end, they're measuring their performance. Because that's the thing they're interested in. They've got to find the linkage at that level.\n\nYeah.\n\nI think investors were very slow off the mark around flexing their muscle, as it were. And partly because they felt self-conscious that actually, they didn't look particularly diverse, themselves. And now I think we've overcome that. And certainly, Legal & General has been right out there in front. And we've now got, within the 30% Club, an investor group of almost 30 institutional houses and over \u00a310tn of money. That's a lot of money. We do get together and when companies are really dragging their feet, or just even ignoring us completely.\n\nI think it's been really interesting, just to look for example here in the UK, at the pay gap legislation. For example, where for the first time... is really quite groundbreaking. And I think a lot of people in Britain don't realise how people around the rest of the world are quite amazed by this. The companies...\n\nAnd we're the only country doing it properly, actually.\n\nRight.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd so companies, for the first time, have to actually report their pay gap. So that was really exciting last year. But then this year, it's so interesting. In the last few weeks we've had... the BBC did this really interesting analysis. I'm sure you saw it, actually.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nFour out of 10 companies actually had a wider pay gap.\n\nPay gap.\n\nNot really where we were expecting to go.\n\nNo.\n\nAnd then it seems as though the sanctions that people thought were going to be imposed on companies that...\n\nWeren't.\n\nRight.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo companies have been able to report figures that make no mathematical sense. And they haven't really been abiding by the guidelines, and nothing's happened. So that, to me, is a kind of a microcosm in a way of where we seem to be in a lot of areas.\n\nYes. And I think that's actually part of what needs to happen next with the women's movement, particularly in the workplace, which is I think we have to get really clear about what it is that we want and what it is that we expect. And then demand it in a really strategic way, and a systematic way.\n\nBecause when it is happening in isolation, when we're doing this in silos, you don't really have that sort of systemic change that you need for this to be something that's long lasting. And that's got to be the next phase of it. Otherwise, all it is we're complaining, we're shouting, but we're not actually forcing change. We're speaking truth to power, but we're not changing the power dynamic.\n\nRight, right, right. June, you spent the last couple of months working on this diversity series. What's been the big takeaway?\n\nNumber one, just how beneficial it is for the bottom line, and that actually companies need to see this as a way of future proofing their businesses. And then the second part is, it's just the right thing to do. Yes, it's a smart thing to do. But it's also the right thing to do. And I think what I've been most energised by is the way that, in the last couple of years, I've seen a sort of a willingness, at least an openness where people are actually open to at least having the conversation. And I think that, in itself, is a shift."

  "text": "This year, the art market report presented at Tefaf\u2019s symposium will focus on China \u2014 its emergence in the past 30 years, its key players and its future. One week later, on March 22, Sotheby\u2019s New York will offer works that have been changing hands in China for far more than 30 years. The star is the 15th-century painter Shen Zhou\u2019s \u201cPoems on falling flowers in running script\u201d (est $1.2m-$1.8m), a handscroll written when the artist was grieving for a lost son. Its provenance stretches from a Ming dynasty Yuanjin temple to the 20th-century painter and collector Wu Hufan. Other highlights include Chen Hongshou\u2019s delicate, pink-tipped 17th-century ink on silk \u201cLotus and Rock\u201d (est $1m-$1.5m) and Xu Beihong\u2019s 1935 \u201cGalloping Horse\u201d (est $150,000-$250,000).\n\nOther Chinese treasures go on sale in New York at Christie\u2019s, from the collection of Florence and Herbert Irving. The Asia wing at New York\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art carries the Irvings\u2019 name, as they donated more than $100m and 1,300 objects to the institution. The theme of the March 20 sale is academic: an unusual Qing dynasty \u201cspinach-green\u201d jade pot (est $200,000-$300,000) shows a scholar trailed by a devoted attendant, shade-giving peach branch in hand; Fu Baoshi\u2019s ink and colour work on paper seats another scholar at his desk, quill poised over an empty page, while a snooping passer-by peeks in the window (\u201cLithe like a crane, leisurely like a seagull\u201d, est $800,000-$1.2m).\n\n18th-century Qing dynasty pot\n\nAt the end of the month, at Paris\u2019s Drouot, two Renoirs are included in a collection of paintings, furniture and bronzes dating from 1592 to the 20th century. A glowing apricot-pink wall is as striking as the foregrounded fruit and flowers in the artist\u2019s \u201cStill life, flowers, oranges and lemons\u201d (1888, est \u20ac400,000-\u20ac500,000), while his hazy \u201cNormandy Landscape\u201d is touched by a light wind (1894, est \u20ac60,000-\u20ac80,000). A suite of six velvet-covered chairs and a triple sofa, whose carpentry dates to the 1710s, are estimated at the same price as Renoir\u2019s landscape, while a sterling silver chocolati\u00e8re with a dark wood handle is expected to go for \u20ac250-\u20ac350.\n\nRenoir\u2019s \u2018Still life, flowers, oranges and lemons\u2019 (1888)\n\nThe end of March also sees the return of the Bada fair, whose 27th edition of fine art, design and antiques runs in London\u2019s Duke of York Square from March 20-26. New additions to the 100 or so galleries include Milan-based Salamon Fine Art, who will show a selection of Old Master prints. Rembrandt\u2019s young \u201cSeated Man\u201d reclines in an alcove with a wry smile; Durer\u2019s \u201cSaint Gerome in the Desert\u201d kneels penitent, lion by his side. Confirmed highlights elsewhere in the fair include a gilt wood sofa from Thomas Chippendale\u2019s workshop, and a 1940s Sibyl Dunlop moonstone and sapphire brooch. The fair will be complemented by an exhibition, Philip de L\u00e1szl\u00f3: An Anniversary Celebration of one of the last Grand Manner portraitists, famed for his paintings of leading public figures and aristocracy.\n\nDurer\u2019s \u2018Saint Gerome in the Desert\u2019 (1496) \u00a9 Saloman Fine Art\n\nIn the autumn, 100 exhibitors set up in London again, at Lapada in Berkeley Square (September 13-18), where prices range from \u00a3500-\u00a3500,000. Last year, Anthea A G Antiques was the goose with the golden egg \u2014 or, in fact, the golden duck: a Georges Lenfant dress clip, \u201cMr D Duck with attitude\u201d, with a heart made of citrine and a diamond bow around his neck.\n\nTwo months later, the 29th edition of Olympia London\u2019s winter art and antiques fair (November 4-10) comes at an exciting time \u2014 planning has just been approved for a \u00a3700m regeneration of the area. In addition to new communal areas, the project will build a 1,000-seat arts space and a 1,500-seat theatre, but access to the fair\u2019s site will remain open throughout the works. Furniture highlights include an 1830s satinwood and pietra dura marble table from S&S Timms, and an Italian Louis XIV gilt wood and marble-topped centre table. Another recently announced expansion, of Masterpiece\u2019s partnership with Fine Art Asia (October 4-7), involves a reciprocal arrangement in which each will have stalls at the other\u2019s fair. Masterpiece\u2019s slot at the Hong Kong fair will be large enough for 25 exhibitors.\n\nFollow @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

    "Richard Feigen"
  ],
  "text": "Veteran art dealer Richard Feigen, 88, may have bought and sold hundreds of works during the past 60 years, but when it comes to offering five Old Master paintings from his own home, he is having serious seller\u2019s remorse. \u201cThey\u2019re only a part of my collection, it\u2019s basically to release some liquidity, but I\u2019ve let go of them very reluctantly,\u201d he tells me over the telephone from New York.\n\nEach piece packs a punch, and together they are estimated to make between $7.8m and $12.4m at Christie\u2019s on May 1. Particularly powerful is the work that Feigen says he holds most dear, a small \u201cVanitas Still Life\u201d (c1620) by the Italian Baroque painter Guercino (est $2m-$3m). Likely painted for the Capuchin church in Guercino\u2019s native town of Cento, near Bologna, the haunting images of a skull, hourglass and fading flowers hide another treat on the back of the frame. Here, an enthusiastic 19th-century owner of the work has stuck a handwritten excerpt about the work, copied from an Italian book, that includes details of the painting\u2019s authorship and provenance.\n\nAnother work with a two-sided tale is John Constable\u2019s \u201cThe Skylark, Dedham\u201d (c1830), a delightful oil-on-board of the artist\u2019s beloved Stour Valley. Paul Raison, chairman of Old Masters for Christie\u2019s Europe, describes the deft work as \u201ca pure palette knife job\u201d (est. $800,000-$1.2m). On the back of this, and revealed through its frame, is an earlier painted study of a cow standing in a stream, dated to around 1820.\n\nJohn Constable\u2019s 'The Skylark, Dedham' (c1830)\n\nFeigen\u2019s keen eye and experience contributed to the attribution of \u201cThe Madonna and Child with Saint Lucy and the Young Saint John the Baptist\u201d as one of the earliest panel paintings known by the Bologna and Rome artist Annibale Carracci (c1587-8, est $3m-$5m). Feigen bought the work, which shows the blinded saint being handed back her eyes, for $1.4m from Phillips in 1987 when it was sold as by Sisto Badalocchio, a pupil of Annibale Carracci. The work had also previously been attributed to Annibale\u2019s cousin, Ludovico Carracci. Other experts had recognised the painting as by Annibale, but it was Feigen who nailed its now accepted attribution. This work could break the artist\u2019s auction record, set at $3.4m in 2013 for a painting of the Annunciation.\n\nAnnibale Carracci\u2019s \u2018Madonna and Child with Saint Lucy and the Young Saint John the Baptist\u2019 (c1587-88)\n\nThe opportunity for discovery is partly what turned Feigen on to older art, having first opened a gallery focused on German Expressionism and Surrealist art in Chicago in 1957. Also, Feigen says, \u201cI saw a lot of intrinsic value [in Old Masters] with prices relatively low.\u201d\n\nThis dynamic persists, but Feigen is downbeat about the market today: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty bad, there are fewer collectors of older art around,\u201d he says. Of the exception to the rule \u2014 Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d (c1500) that Christie\u2019s sold to Abu Dhabi\u2019s Department of Culture and Tourism for a staggering $450.3m \u2014 Feigen is clear that this painting \u201cwas of no interest to me at any price\u201d.\n\nLorenzo Monaco\u2019s \u2018The Prophet Isaiah\u2019 (c1410-15)\n\nThe other two works Feigen is selling in May are Lorenzo Monaco\u2019s rhythmic gold-ground tondo, \u201cThe Prophet Isaiah\u201d (c1410-15, $1.5m-$2.5m), which belonged to the \u201cAnnunciation\u201d altarpiece now in the Accademia in Florence and another Guercino, a later, large-scale painting of \u201cSaint John in the Wilderness\u201d (1652, $500,000-$700,000). \u201cAll of the works bear witness to his great taste,\u201d Raison says.\n\nGuercino\u2019s 'Saint John in the Wilderness' (1652)\n\nFollow @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

  "text": "What\u2019s in a name? These days, almost everything. Name-based celebrity culture rules so many aspects of our public life; our private lives too, as social media shows. Brand awareness has never been higher: five-year-olds can identify a brand of trainers at 50 yards.\n\nIn the art world, names matter almost beyond anything else. Artists\u2019 names, gallery names, collectors\u2019 names: I\u2019ve even seen it excitedly reported of a work at an art fair that \u201cLeonardo DiCaprio was seen looking at it\u201d. (And that was all we learned about the piece.) Recently it was announced that a painting discovered in a French attic is coming to market with a staggering estimate of \u20ac100m \u2014 since it is \u201calmost certainly\u201d, as one expert put it, by Caravaggio.\n\nMuch more quietly, something else caught my eye last week. Freeman\u2019s of Philadelphia, apparently America\u2019s oldest auction house, scooped a whopping $2.47m for a 15th-century Madonna \u2014 by an unknown artist. Or rather, a known artist, but one without a name. He, or she, or they, are called by the \u201cNotname\u201d of the Master of the Embroidered Foliage, a moniker that refers to a distinctive way of painting leaves, like stitches in embroidery. (And which makes me wonder if the Master could have been a woman.)\n\nIn fact the Foliage Master is reckoned to have been a group of painters, active in Brussels or Bruges between 1480 and 1510. Their Madonnas\u2019 poses are similar \u2014 perhaps even templated \u2014 but the gorgeous background detail of flowers and plants, dogs and peacocks, makes the works so distinctive.\n\nYet we have no idea who the painter, or painters, were. There are scores, perhaps hundreds, of such Notname Master artists. Despite expert research and the whole arsenal of modern forensics, their identities elude us. Their nicknames are drawn from a place, a stylistic feature or a single work, often an altarpiece or a Book of Hours \u2014 but there\u2019s also, more unusually, the Master of the City of Ladies, whose exquisite allegorical illustration showing well-dressed women building a wall was made for a book by the medieval writer Christine de Pizan.\n\n\u2018Nursing Madonna\u2019 (c1480-1510) by the Master of the Embroidered Foliage, which was sold by Freeman\u2019s of Philadelphia for $2.47m last week\n\nThe quality of the Masters\u2019 works can be astounding, and their paintings hang in the world\u2019s great museums, as well as in the churches for which they were made. My own favourite is the Master of the Saint Bartholomew Altarpiece, whose stunning works can be seen in Munich\u2019s Alte Pinakothek, the Louvre, the National Galleries of both Washington DC and London (where there are four) and other great museums. With his searing colours \u2014 russets and sea greens, oranges and olives, whites and golds \u2014 and his \u201cGothic\u201d style that still throbs with a subtle, detailed humanity, he\u2019s so distinctive that scholars have confidently identified more than 25 works, made across a 35-year career. But we still don\u2019t know who he was.\n\nAlmost all the anonymous Masters are from Northern Europe. In Italy it was quite a different story. Partly thanks to Vasari\u2019s Lives of the Artists, published in 1550 and several times updated, we know an awful lot about the Italians: not just facts (which Vasari often got wrong) but anecdotes, gossip, physical quirks and more. We know about their practical jokes, the price of the eggs in the tempera they used. We know Michelangelo slept with his boots on; we know about Titian\u2019s taxes. We might not know or care less about the art of Buonamico Buffalmacco but Vasari will tell us when and why he stole a pig.\n\nSo in the Renaissance and even earlier a strong sense of identity, perhaps even a form of celebrity culture, flourished among Italy\u2019s artists. We also know about the complicated politics of their world: about money and patronage, reputation building, officialdom. And plenty of vicious backbiting, too: it all seems very familiar, very modern.\n\nAlmost all the anonymous Masters are from Northern Europe. In Italy it was quite a different story\n\nMost importantly of all, the Italians signed their pictures. With very few exceptions, the northern artists didn\u2019t. The great Jan Van Eyck was almost the only 15th-century Netherlandish painter to sign his work, often with a pun on his name, \u201cALS IK KAN\u201d (As I (Eyck) can). Not only were there no signatures from the other northerners but \u2014 and this speaks volumes about the status of artists there at the time \u2014 even collectors who kept elaborate inventories of their pictures seemed to have little interest in the artists\u2019 actual names.\n\nWithout those names and signatures, facts are near-impossible to establish. Even for some now-revered artists such as Rogier van der Weyden, only a complicated process of sleuthing, forensics, connoisseurship and sheer guesswork over the course of years has arrived at a proper identification.\n\nA Notname is quite different from a pseudonym. Today\u2019s few pseudonymous cultural figures \u2014 Banksy, Elena Ferrante \u2014 have deliberately sculpted an alt-identity that\u2019s as much a brand as any. Of course, a Notname can achieve \u201cname\u201d status too. But at least those shadowy anonymous figures we strain to see through the veil of time can be sure that, if we value their work or it sells for a lot of money, it\u2019s because of its quality. Nothing else.\n\nFollow @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first. Subscribe to FT Life on YouTube for the latest FT Weekend videos"

  "text": "Drawings Week in Paris rarely disappoints, but this year there is an additional incentive to make the pilgrimage to this annual shrine to the line. Apart from the two main fairs \u2014 the stately Salon du Dessin at the Palais Brongniart (March 27-April 1), which brings together works on paper spanning some six centuries, and the vibrant Drawing Now (March 28-31) which illustrates what drawing can be, not least when liberated from two dimensions \u2014 the city offers exceptional exhibitions and auctions.\n\nNot to be missed is The Pushkin Museum: Five Hundred Years of Master Drawings at the Fondation Custodia (to May 12). This is the rarest of opportunities to inspect some 195 works on paper from one of the world\u2019s greatest but least-known drawings collections.\n\nHere are remarkable works by Matisse and Picasso \u2014 from the pen and watercolour sketch for \u201cLa Danse (Composition no I)\u201d and the charcoal \u201cPortrait of Lydia Delectorskaya\u201d to the preparatory studies, in gouache and charcoal, and gouache and watercolour, for the \u201cFamily of Saltimbanques\u201d and \u201cThree Women\u201d. From 19th-century France are extraordinary sheets by Van Gogh, Renoir and Daumier, and hardly less astounding works from Germany, with Caspar David Friedrich\u2019s evocative chalk and brown wash \u201cTwo Men on the Sea Coast\u201d stealing the show. This feast is an entire history of the draughtsman\u2019s art.\n\nFar more modest, but no less exciting an opportunity, is the display of the 29 Italian Renaissance drawings by Leonardo da Vinci and his contemporaries belonging to the Beaux-Arts de Paris (to April 19). It is worth the queue to see the master\u2019s compelling sheet of ideas for armour for foot soldiers and an exploding bomb, and the delicate head of the Virgin by Raphael.\n\nThese are just two of the events in more than 20 museums and galleries in and around Paris, with two more exhibitions \u2014 drawn from the still-closed Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet and the archive of jewellers Chaumet \u2014 in the Salon du Dessin itself.\n\nMatisse\u2019s \u2018Portrait de Lydia Delectorskaya\u2019 (1945) \u00a9 Mus\u00e9e d\u2019\u00c9tat des Beaux-Arts Pouchkine, Moscou/Succession H Matisse\n\nOver the course of this international fair\u2019s 28 years, the focus has shifted towards the 19th and 20th centuries, because of the scarcity of older material. \u201cImportant Old Master drawings are still highly sought after and are becoming increasingly expensive, but they are harder to source,\u201d explains the fair\u2019s president, Louis de Bayser. \u201cWhat we bring to the fair depends on what we have found in the past year.\u201d\n\nThe highlight at Galerie de Bayser is a large portrait of a seated young woman by Fran\u00e7ois Boucher from about 1748-50, the sparkling condition of its coloured chalks and pastel providing volume to the drapery and presence to the model. The gallery has exhibited at the Salon du Dessin since its inception and each year has sold to new buyers. \u201cSome buy a drawing for \u20ac5,000 once on a whim, and others become real collectors,\u201d de Bayser says.\n\nEach year, four or five new or returning exhibitors out of the 39 enliven the mix by presenting a particular taste or expertise. Flying the flag for Belgium is the Lancz Gallery, and its star turn is the widely published and exhibited \u201cThe Glass Roof\u201d (1909) by the Symbolist painter and draughtsman L\u00e9on Spilliaert (\u20ac800,000-\u20ac1m). This near-monochrome dissection of the artist\u2019s studio is as much an interior portrait of alienation and oppression.\n\nFriedrich\u2019s \u2018Two Men on the Sea Coast\u2019 (1830-35) \u00a9 Mus\u00e9e d\u2019\u00c9tat des Beaux-Arts Pouchkine, Moscou\n\nFresh from the Egon Schiele retrospective at the Fondation Louis Vuitton is the Viennese artist\u2019s gouache, watercolour and pencil \u201cStanding Woman Covering Face with Both Hands\u201d (1911, Wienerroither & Kohlbacher, \u20ac1.9m), while Hamburg dealer Martin Moeller presents 100 years of German drawings. New US exhibitor Christopher Bishop looks even further afield to the imperial court of Maximilian II in Prague by flourishing a rare and recently rediscovered ink, chalk and red and green wash drawing by Bartholomeus Spranger, a preparatory work of around 1583 for his \u201cSaint Ursula now in Vilnius\u201d (about \u20ac150,000).\n\nThe real blast of fresh air in this week of drawings, however, has come from Drawing Now. Founded in 2007, it was the first contemporary art fair in Europe dedicated to drawing, and it remains the most important \u2014 growing in confidence and stature since its move to the airy, top-lit spaces of the Carreau du Temple. Here, all 72 exhibitors are selected on the merits of their proposals alone, and at least a third of each stand must be devoted to solo or focus shows.\n\n\u201cWe want to see a mix of galleries showing a diverse range of artistic practice over the last 50 years \u2014 15 countries are represented this year \u2014 but we also want to have galleries that curators and collectors can only see here,\u201d explains director Carine Tissot. \u201cNew approaches are important, works in radical media that push boundaries.\u201d\n\nSusanna Inglada\u2019s \u2018The Showroom\u2019 (2017) \u00a9 Susanna Inglada/Galerie Maurits van de Laar\n\nLong out of the frame and off the wall, as three-dimensional installations by the likes of Susanna Inglada bear witness (at Galerie Maurits van de Laar), the line is propelled into action this year through a programme of performative pieces scheduled within and without the fair. Prices range from \u20ac1,500-\u20ac50,000.\n\nAs for the auctions, private collections prevail at both Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s. The announcement that Christie\u2019s is selling master drawings belonging to the Swiss former banker Jean Bonna will have electrified every major collector and curator, for this distinguished holding is well known through museum exhibitions in Paris, New York and Lausanne.\n\nHowever, the 100 or so drawings to be offered across sales in Paris this month, in London in July and New York in January 2020, will not include the Raphael or most of the collector\u2019s other Italian Renaissance drawings \u2014 or, more generally, his most celebrated works on paper. Disappointments aside, the March 27 sale includes two delectable head studies in red chalks, one by Raffaellino del Colle (c1530, estimate \u20ac250,000- \u20ac350,000), the other Greuze\u2019s \u201cPouting Girl\u201d (c1760-65, \u20ac70,000-\u20ac100,000), while Renoir shines on March 28. More than \u20ac1m is expected overall.\n\nThousands of drawings will be on show and on offer in Paris during Drawings Week. It is hard to believe there will not be something to tempt everyone.\n\nsalondudessin.com; drawingnowartfair.com; fondationcustodia.fr; beauxartsparis.fr; christies.com; sothebys.com\n\nFollow @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

  "title": "Collector Laurent Dumas on his plan for a new private museum on Paris\u2019 Ile Seguin",
  "authors": [
    "Georgina Adam",
    "Visual Arts"
  ],
  "text": "While mega-influencers like Fran\u00e7ois Pinault and Bernard Arnault hit the headlines with their sumptuous museums, France has other collectors who are also making their mark, even if they are not such household names. Laurent Dumas is among these, with growing art holdings, a desire to support and promote French artists \u2014 and a new private museum planned for 2022.\n\nDumas is the founder and president of French real-estate developer Emerige. Its offices are tucked away behind a plain grey-painted door in the Marais district, close to the Centre Pompidou. While the building, the H\u00f4tel Beaubrun, dates from the 17th century, the interior courtyard immediately gives the game away \u2014 two large, contemporary works of art are the first things that greet the visitor.\n\nOne is a giant red-and-white die propped on a rock, \u201cThe Misthrown Dice\u201d (2017) by Gilles Barbier, while opposite stands a thickly indented blue wall, apparently in concrete but in fact in resin, by Didier Marcel, \u201cGrand Labour bleu\u201d (2011). Hanging in the reception is a large abstract by the French artist Ne\u00efl Beloufa (\u201c2018-Wide\u201d, 2017), a colourful assemblage of resin, cardboard and electric cables. Beside the door is a ceramic sculpture of a figure bearing a block by Stefan Rinck (\u201cThis Magic Box, You Carry\u201d, 2017).\n\nFriendly, welcoming and tanned from a recent safari in Zambia, Dumas receives me in his office, which is dominated by a huge geometrical black-and-white triptych by Gregor Hildebrandt, \u201cUnd ihr ginget selbdritt durch den Abend (P.Celan)\u201d (2013). He recounts how he built up his business from scratch, starting almost 30 years ago. His projects \u2014 from refurbished existing buildings to new-build sites \u2014 are dotted around the Paris region and in Madrid and Barcelona, and he is thinking of extending into Ireland.\n\n\u201cAnd yet my mother brought me up saying there were two sectors I should never go into: insurance and real estate!\u201d he laughs. \u201cAnd when I did go into real estate, she was absolutely furious, and hardly spoke to me for two years!\u201d\n\nClaire Tabouret\u2019s \u2018Makeup (Red and Purple)\u2019 (2016)\n\nSince then she has had to acknowledge his success: Emerige (a combination of aime, love, and \u00e9riger, to build) has grown strongly, now numbering 200 employees; its turnover was about \u20ac400m in 2018. Dumas was awarded \u201centrepreneur of the year\u201d for the Paris region in 2017 by Ernst & Young and, according to the magazine Challenges, he is now worth some \u20ac250m.\n\nAs important to Dumas as his business is his engagement with art, and particularly his support for the French artistic field, as well as a number of philanthropic ventures. His collection of mainly contemporary art now counts over 1,000 works, including an abstract by his first artistic love, Bram van Velde, and a double-sided portrait of a man by Alberto Giacometti, as well as works by young French artists such as Claire Tabouret and Edgar Sarin.\n\nHis taste is eclectic, ranging from bold abstract painting to large sculpture, with an interest in the human form. A first catalogue of the collection has just been published, edited by the French journalist Roxana Azimi.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a collection that has grown quite fast,\u201d says French gallerist Marion Papillon, who has worked with Dumas for 10 years and whose gallery was the partner last year for selection of the annual Emerige grant for emerging artists. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a personal choice; when Laurent is looking at art, he makes quick, spontaneous decisions. He is very loyal to the artists he supports and to the galleries. He is incredibly generous \u2014 and at a time when there are fewer and fewer collectors like him.\u201d\n\nFabrice Hyber\u2019s \u2018Les Deux Ch\u00eanes\u2019 (2018) \u00a9 Charlotte Donker\n\nAt the moment the Dumas collection is displayed in his home and offices, but the great leap comes in 2022, when he will open a private museum on the southern tip of \u00cele Seguin in the west of Paris.\n\nThe location has a chequered history. Formerly the site of a large Renault factory, the island was where luxury goods mogul Fran\u00e7ois Pinault wanted to put a museum, before he despaired of delays and irksome red tape and took his art to Venice. Then the Freeport operator Yves Bouvier bagged the spot, before getting into an epic and ongoing fight with his former client, the Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, over art purchases \u2014 but that\u2019s another story altogether.\n\nNow Emerige has bought the site and obtained all the necessary planning permits; the as-yet-untitled museum will total 5,000 sq metres, with 2,000 sq metres of exhibition space; a hotel and a multiplex cinema complete the project. The roving independent curator J\u00e9r\u00f4me Sans will be co-artistic director, sharing the role with Paula Aisemberg, who until recently was director of La Maison Rouge, a private exhibition space started by collector Antoine de Galbert, which closed in October 2018.\n\nAs well as buying for himself and his future museum, Dumas has initiated a programme to place a sculpture or painting in real estate developments. Entitled \u201cUn immeuble, une oeuvre\u201d (\u201cone building, one work of art\u201d), the programme includes 20 developers who commission a work of art for each project \u2014 so far, three have been installed, with a couple of dozen more in the works: artists include Rapha\u00ebl Zarka, Fabrice Hyber, Marc Vellay and Pascale Marthine Tayou. And Emerige has other outreach programmes, including organising summer trips to Versailles and its gardens for underprivileged children \u2014 so far 15,000 of them have spent a day playing in the grounds where Marie Antoinette once frolicked.\n\nDumas wants his museum to break new ground in more ways than one. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be too formal and regulated,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhile the decision hasn\u2019t been made, we are currently considering having free entry and a light touch for security; we want the visitors to feel responsible for the art, to appeal to their civic sense.\u201d\n\nI ask about the safety of the works, arguing that the French are not necessarily renowned for their public spirit. \u201cObviously there will be security and guards,\u201d he says, \u201cand things would be different, for instance, if we put on a Giacometti exhibition or one featuring young French artists, whose value is much lower.\u201d\n\nWhile Dumas has many international names in his holdings, among them Elmgreen & Dragset, Danh Vo, Thomas Houseago and Thomas Hirschhorn, he is dedicated to promoting the Gallic artistic scene; the catalogue focuses on 18 French artists from his collection, from Jean-Michel Alberola to Jean-Luc Verna. And he collects in depth: \u201cIf I only have one work by an artist, I probably wouldn\u2019t keep it,\u201d he says. \u201cI like to buy at least two or three.\u201d\n\nI ask why he thinks French artists are less prominent internationally than those of some other countries, both institutionally and commercially. \u201cFor a start, I feel that French museums don\u2019t support them enough,\u201d he answers. \u201cThen the artists themselves sometimes lack energy and ambition \u2014 and even French galleries could be more ambitious. But there are hundreds of important artists, they deserve to be better known.\u201d\n\nWill the fact of putting his works on public display, in a museum, change what he buys? \u201cNo,\u201d he answers. \u201cIt will remain my personal choice. But I have noticed that it does change what galleries offer you \u2014 they certainly propose more significant works.\u201d However, the museum will not only show his collection \u2014 various collaborations are planned, with the Giacometti Foundation and the Swiss-based Fondation Gandur pour l\u2019Art, among others.\n\nI ask Dumas if he does anything else besides collecting. \u201cSport? Quelle horreur! No, I completely mix art and business . . . I will spend an hour at an artist\u2019s studio between meetings. So pleasure and work are completely intertwined for me.\u201d\n\nWith that, he politely accompanies me to the door, and then suddenly disappears into another office. As he said earlier: \u201cI have less and less time, and more and more to do. But I love sharing my passion for art!\u201d\n\nFollow @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

  "text": "A shake-up in the selection procedure and fresh thinking at Tefaf Maastricht has seen a number of newcomers to this venerable fair. Forty of this year\u2019s 279 exhibitors are new to Tefaf Maastricht and 14 of those are hosted in the Modern section.\n\nFrench art dealer and collector Almine Rech\u2019s eponymous gallery, which specialises in European and American works from 1870 to the present, makes its debut in the Modern section. \u201cTefaf focuses more on artists and history than it does on trends,\u201d says Rech, \u201cwhich is why we participate with our historical artists \u2014 such as Pablo Picasso, G\u00fcnther F\u00f6rg, Antoni T\u00e0pies and Ha Chong-Hyun \u2014 and established contemporary artists such as Miquel Barcel\u00f3 and Richard Prince.\u201d A highlight is a colourful and erotic work by the American Pop artist Tom Wesselmann. Think baby-blue eye shadow and a peach-tinted pout.\n\nJoining Almine Rech is Simon Lee Gallery, which comes to Tefaf Maastricht for the first time, having taken part in the fair\u2019s New York edition. With historically significant works by big-name artists such as Jean-Michel Basquiat, George Condo and Pablo Picasso, the line-up includes Basquiat\u2019s \u201cVincent Van Gogh in a Wax Museum in Amsterdam\u201d (1985), a fiery portrait of the Dutch artist with piercing blue eyes and blazing red-and-yellow hair.\n\nSpr\u00fcth Magers, an avid supporter of women artists, steps up with a single-artist show devoted to Rosemarie Trockel. The German conceptual artist rose to fame in the hothouse contemporary scene in Cologne in the 1980s, with pieces incorporating everyday materials from bronze to wool. Here, the spotlight is on her ceramics, exhibited in an elegant sandstone stand that \u201cmatches the very unique standing of Tefaf Maastricht\u201d, says Monika Spr\u00fcth. She and co-founder Philomene Magers also hope to reach a new audience.\n\nThough this year\u2019s changes are concentrated in the Modern section, newcomers are cropping up across a range of genres. Sophie Jackson, director of London-based Symbolic & Chase, making its debut in the Antiques section, comments, \u201cIn a world confronting the potential apex of the art-fair formula, it\u2019s a joy to be able to show our clients that Tefaf remains the best destination for serious collectors.\u201d\n\nWith expertise in fine jewellery from the 19th century onwards, Symbolic & Chase is exhibiting twinkling pieces such as a 1950s Cartier diamond necklace, a pair of 1960s Cartier ear clips and an Art Deco ruby-and-diamond necklace inspired by Indian designs.\n\nFrom the modern to the ancient: Kallos Gallery takes part in Tefaf Maastrich proper for the first time after testing the water last year in Showcase, a springboard-like section, open to recently established galleries. Founded by collector Baron Lorne Thyssen-Bornemisza in 2014, the gallery specialises in antiquities and ancient art: among works on show are a Greek bronze statue of Zeus, bearded and taut-bodied, and an Egyptian alabaster canopic jar engraved with hieroglyphs.\n\nDirector Madeleine Perridge comments that \u201cBaron Thyssen and I are delighted to have the opportunity to participate and showcase our selection of exceptional ancient art alongside masterpieces from the whole history of world art.\u201d\n\nFollow @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

  "text": "The Tefaf Maastricht art fair has long enjoyed a reputation as the most prestigious commercial gathering for lovers of fine and decorative art made well before the 20th century. At this year\u2019s 32nd edition, however, much of the energy among the 279 exhibitors will come instead from the unlikely corner of Modern and contemporary art, thanks to the efforts of the New York power dealer Christophe Van de Weghe. \u201cMaastricht is the Mecca of art fairs but, by international standards, the Modern section just wasn\u2019t good enough,\u201d Van de Weghe says.\n\nWith this in mind, he became chairman of the category after last year\u2019s fair and, together with a selection committee of other dealers in the field, helped upgrade its 57 exhibitors with an impressive list of 14 Modern and contemporary newcomers. These include Pace, Simon Lee, Max Hetzler and Spr\u00fcth Magers, while other galleries return to Maastricht \u2014 in the case of Gmurzynska, after a 17-year break.\n\nThe plan, Van de Weghe says, is to swell the fair\u2019s visitors with the more plentiful buyers of Modern art, and turn them on to high-quality older works that could complement their taste. It\u2019s a cross-collecting trend that other fairs, such as Frieze Masters, have also tapped into and it mirrors Van de Weghe\u2019s own collecting habits.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been showing at Tefaf Maastricht for more than 10 years and, little by little, I\u2019ve got to know the dealers in Old Masters, in coins, in Greek and Roman art, and I\u2019ve started to mix.\u201d\n\nJos\u00e9 Pedro Costigliolo\u2019s \u2018Rect\u00e1ngulos y Cuadrados CLX\u2019 (1970) \u00a9 Galeria Sur\n\nHis personal purchases have included a painting by Tintoretto and, in his New York home, he has paired a Picasso painting with a Corinthian helmet that he bought from the fair. \u201cIt\u2019s about extending horizons,\u201d he says.\n\nBut why, when there are so many other fairs for Modern and contemporary dealers, would galleries throw their weight behind yet another event to help draw in buyers of other categories?\n\nFrantisek Kupka\u2019s \u2018Plan bleu dans le rouge\u2019 (1932) \u00a9 Galerie le Minotaure\n\nFor a start, \u201cChristophe is impossible to say no to,\u201d says Marc Glimcher, president of Pace. He was also persuaded by the opportunity to come to the Netherlands, which has \u201can entrepreneurial economy that we want to be a part of.\u201d Plus, Glimcher adds, it offers an ideal place to show a selection of early works by the Dutchman Piet Mondrian that come from the collection of his legendary dealer Sidney Janis.\n\nAmazingly, the globe-trotting new exhibitors were not put off by Tefaf Maastricht\u2019s two-week run (including VIP days), which is a considerably longer commitment than most other fairs on the circuit (these generally last about five days all in). \u201cI\u2019m never even in New York [his home town] for that long,\u201d Glimcher jokes.\n\nClaude Lalanne\u2019s \u2018Pomme de Jardin (Rouge)\u2019 (c2011-17) \u00a9 Ben Brown Fine Arts\n\nMax Edouard Hetzler, who co-runs the family\u2019s Berlin and Paris gallery in London, sees the duration of the fair as a potential advantage in a crowded calendar. \u201cThe pace that people look at things will be different, which could allow for more meaningful conversations,\u201d he says. His gallery brings works by a selection of its artists, including Edmund de Waal, Raymond Hains and G\u00fcnther Forg.\n\nHetzler says that a successful showing at Tefaf\u2019s New York event last May helped bring him on board in Maastricht. Indeed, while Tefaf\u2019s launch in 2016 of two smaller fairs in New York (one for older art, one for Modern and contemporary) may have subsequently created some legal wrangles with their minority owners, Artvest, these fairs have successfully introduced the brand and its luxurious trappings \u2014 think gorgeous floral displays, champagne and oysters \u2014 to a new audience. The hedge funder Daniel Loeb, whose investments through Third Point include a 12 per cent stake in Sotheby\u2019s, visited the fair in New York \u201calmost every day\u201d, Van de Weghe says.\n\n\u201cThe New York fairs have shown a slice of what Tefaf is about. They made my clients say: \u2018Woah! I want to see the mothership,\u2019 \u201d he explains.\n\nGeorge Condo\u2019s \u2018Dionysis\u2019 (2002) \u00a9 Galerie Andrea Caratsch\n\nIn an event-driven marketplace, making Maastricht a destination is all-important. The fair is working with the city, as well as the MECC convention centre that hosts it, and the Limburg provincial government, to upgrade the transport links and hotels to suit an increasingly jet-setting clientele. Such investment is a slow burn but seems to have scotched rumours that the fair might move to a better-connected city such as Amsterdam or Brussels.\n\nRinging the changes at an established art fair is never an easy task, but many of Tefaf\u2019s longer-standing exhibitors see the latest efforts as an enhancement rather than a dramatic adjustment. \u201cTefaf has always been a cross-collecting fair,\u201d says the maps and rare books dealer Daniel Crouch. Others, who themselves have a mixed category offering, see the move as part of a wider trend. \u201cWe are happy to see the fair embrace these new perspectives in collecting,\u201d says Ben Tomlinson of Robilant + Voena.\n\nEtienne B\u00e9othy\u2019s \u2018Danse cosaque (Danse russe, Paraboles) Opus 045\u2019 (1930) \u00a9 Galerie le Minotaure\n\nBehind the shift is the reality that taste is changing as a new generation comes into the art market.\n\n\u201cInterest today seems to be more driven by the aesthetic than the academic \u2014 things that look instantly good in a photo \u2014 so it can take more time to drum up enthusiasm for, for example, 18th-century furniture or bronzes,\u201d says Dirk Boll, president of Christie\u2019s in Europe, the Middle East, Russia and India.\n\nVan de Weghe sees this dynamic as precisely where Tefaf fits in. \u201cGoing to Maastricht is like going to a museum,\u201d he says, \u201cexcept you can also ask lots of questions.\u201d\n\nHighlights: a selection from Tefaf Maastricht \u2018Futurist Blackbirds\u2019 (c1924) by the Italian painter Giacomo Balla, at the Bologna-based gallery Bottegantica Marc Chagall\u2019s \u2018Amoureux au bouquet de dahlias\u2019 (1971), at New York\u2019s Hammer Galleries Silver match holder in the form of an elephant made by Carl Faberg\u00e9 (St Petersburg, c1890), at A La Vieille Russie gallery from New York \u2018Portrait of a Young Lady holding a Cat\u2019 (1525) by Antonio d\u2019Ubertino Verdi, known as Bacchiacca, at New York\u2019s Nicholas Hall Gallery Wooden Songye kifwebe mask from the Democratic Republic of Congo (late 19th-early 20th century), at Didier Claes gallery Wooden male ancestor figure (19th century) from the Hemba people of the Democratic Republic of Congo, at Galerie Bernard Dulon from Paris\n\nTefaf Maastricht loan exhibition 2019 Rembrandt\u2019s 'The Abduction of Ganymede' (1635) Following a fine annual run, the 2019 loan show at Tefaf Maastricht displays 23 works from the Dresden State Art Collections. Its highlight, Rembrandt\u2019s 1635 \u201cThe Abduction of Ganymede\u201d (above), shows the infant carried off by Zeus in the form of a giant eagle. The child\u2019s terror is palpable \u2014 he\u2019s so frightened he is urinating \u2014 and the picture\u2019s emotional realism has not always found favour. In 1915 the expert Hofstede de Groot decided that Rembrandt\u2019s aim was \u201cto burlesque the mythological subject, for he has represented the beautiful Ganymede as a great lubberly child with a blubbering grimace \u2026\u201d Today\u2019s viewers are more likely to see the work as an image of mortality, rather than a homoerotic kidnapping of the \u201cloveliest born of the race of mortals\u201d, as Homer\u2019s Iliad has it. The exhibition presages the reopening at the end of the year of Dresden\u2019s Parader\u00e4ume and Semperbau museums, where these works will have permanent homes.\n\nMarch 16-24, tefaf.com\n\nFollow @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

  "title": "Divine provenance: why we should care where an art work comes from",
  "authors": [
    "Susan Moore",
    "Visual Arts"
  ],
  "text": "Some objects are valuable only because they belonged to someone famous \u2014 think David Beckham\u2019s football boots, Bowie\u2019s record player or just about anything belonging to Napoleon. Others have their value subtly \u2014 or not so subtly \u2014 enhanced by the person or people who owned them in the past.\n\nWhen the spectacular jewellery of Elizabeth Taylor came up for auction at Christie\u2019s New York in 2011, for instance, the top lots sold for up to 50 times their auction estimates, with the evening sale alone realising $116m, a world record for a private jewellery collection. Such was the global allure of the Rockefeller name that all 1,500 lots of the Peggy and David Rockefeller collection found new homes at Christie\u2019s New York last year, establishing a new record for any private collection sold at auction. Its $832.5m total almost doubled that set by the Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Berg\u00e9 sale at Christie\u2019s Paris in 2009, but here perhaps other forces were at work, too. For Saint Laurent was more than a celebrity and cultural icon. A passionate connoisseur of all kinds of works of art, he was renowned for his impeccable taste and exacting standards \u2014 and this kind of endorsement is what bidders were also desperate to buy into.\n\nThose exacting standards involved considerations of quality, condition and rarity but also of provenance: the couturier and his partner, like many great collectors before them, were also not immune to the allure of works of art with an illustrious history. What is clear today is that provenance has become increasingly important in the art market. It is almost impossible to open a catalogue of a major auction or a dealer\u2019s glossy brochure without seeing images of previous owners or the interiors in which the work of art was displayed. The reasons for this are manifold.\n\nFirst the pragmatic: in the face of growing legislation and institutional guidelines, documenting an object\u2019s past has become necessary in order to prove legal title. This relates to both the spoliation of works of art during the Nazi period, and to legal export from the country of origin. A documented provenance, particularly a commission or first purchase of the object, also offers reassurance that the piece is authentic and its attribution correct. Yet less quantifiable benefits come from knowing an object\u2019s past. For some collectors, a fascinating provenance offers not only glamour or reflected glory but also a link with the past and a means of engaging with it.\n\n\u201cWhen I started working in this profession in 1998, the phenomenon of provenance was fairly inconsequential,\u201d explains Floris van der Ven of Vanderven Oriental Art. \u201cNow it is of ever-increasing relevance. In the last 10 years, people have become very selective about what they buy . . . A history, especially an association with someone famous, adds to an object\u2019s appeal and value.\u201d\n\nTelling an object\u2019s story and placing it in context, he believes, brings it alive for clients, which is why the gallery\u2019s exhibition and catalogue at this year\u2019s Tefaf Maastricht is Provenance: Tracing the History of Objects. The added value of its star, museum-quality piece \u2014 a monumental Chinese blue-and-white triple gourd vase of the Kangxi period (1662-1722, price \u20ac400,000) \u2014 is an ownership that has been traced back to one of the greatest collectors of all time: the American banker JP Morgan.\n\nAccording to Lewis Smith, co-director of Koopman Rare Art: \u201cProvenance is almost, but not quite, as important as the object itself.\u201d Dominating this gallery\u2019s stand will be the Shield of Achilles, probably the most spectacular of all 19th-century silver-gilt. It is a piece with exemplary credentials. A design by the Neoclassical sculptor John Flaxman interpreting Homer\u2019s description of the shield made for the classical hero by the god Hephaestus, its technical complexities were so challenging that they took goldsmiths Rundell, Bridge & Rundell almost a decade to resolve. It is, moreover, a perfect expression of the taste, aspirations and financial clout of the crowned heads of Europe.\n\n19th-century Shield of Achilles \u00a9 Koopman Rare Art\n\nWhile a first shield was acquired by George IV and served as the centrepiece of the lavish display at his coronation banquet in 1821, this example was purchased by his brother Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover, determined not to be outdone. \u201cPeople are looking at works of art in a more historical way,\u201d says Smith, adding that a royal provenance such as this adds 20-25 per cent to an object\u2019s value. This price is in excess of \u00a35m.\n\nNo less evocative of a particular personality, place and time is \u201cMonsieur and Madame Satan\u201d, the fantastical, life-size carved wooden figures of a faun and faunness that greeted guests at the entrance to the couturier Elsa Schiaparelli\u2019s luxuriant h\u00f4tel particulier in Paris. The inventive, witty and flamboyant tastemaker of the interwar years had a penchant for the surreal and the slightly sinister. These extraordinary figures (at Daniel Katz Gallery, \u20ac385,000) were spotted, even more extraordinarily, during tweed-sourcing trips to Edinburgh, and minute inscriptions have identified them as the work of the late-19th-century virtuoso Venetian sculptor Francesco Toso. If the Schiaparelli provenance were not enough, this obsessively detailed theatrical pair passed to the designer\u2019s granddaughter, the actress Marisa Berenson.\n\n\u2018Monsieur and Madame Satan\u2019 by Francesco Toso (1880s) \u00a9 Daniel Katz Gallery\n\nA desirable provenance does not always depend on the fame of a previous owner. While the former custodians of the stock of arms and armour dealers Peter Finer read like the Almanach de Gotha, Roland Finer points out that documented incidents relating to arms resonate just as much with their clients. The gallery offers a cased pair of duelling pistols (over \u00a3100,000) that bear the name of the aristocratic owner engraved on the case handle, and a dated receipt that suggests that \u201cColonel King\u201d, most unusually but significantly, paid for the pistols at the time of collection. Two days later, on October 1 1797, he was to use them in Hyde Park in a failed attempt to satisfy family honour, but the melodrama did not stop there.\n\nPistols engraved with \u2018Colonel King\u2019 (1797) \u00a9 Colin Crisford/Peter Finer\n\n\u201cIf a work of art is ugly or unappealing, it does not matter what the provenance is,\u201d insists Martin Levy of Blairman. He offers a rare piece of Anglo-Russian furniture that also happens to be one of the most handsome examples of its kind. This hitherto unpublished \u201cmodern gothic\u201d desk with gunmetal mounts (\u00a3280,000) was designed by the architect Ippolit Monighetti (1819-78) and, as its label reveals, was a gift from the Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich to Lt Col Arthur Ellis, equerry to the Prince of Wales, \u201cin remembrance of HIH\u2019s visit to England, June 1871\u201d. It has remained in the family ever since.\n\n\u201cA provenance reaching back to the origin of an object not only reassures buyers but it also underpins my confidence in fitting an unusual object into the history of 19th-century design more generally,\u201d adds Levy. Works of art, like second-hand cars, also benefit from having had only one careful owner.\n\nFollow @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

    "Reuters Bloomberg"
  ],
  "text": "For years, Uzbekistan was one of the world's most closed and oppressive countries. With thousands of political prisoners and restrictions on the media, the central Asian country ranked alongside North Korea for its political rights and civil liberties.\n\nBut now, Uzbekistan is changing. Following the death of dictator Islam Karimov in 2016, the new government has embarked on a surprising and radical programme of reform.\n\nCurrency controls have been lifted, and the government is trying to overhaul the economy, cut red tape, and boost investment. Foreign investors are now tip-toeing in.\n\nSince the government announced its reforms, we've had a lot of interest from foreign investors, including institutional investors, the strategic investors, and actually those who are willing to take more risk - the opportunistic ones. And I can tell you, the fact that we removed the visa requirements for about, I think, 40 countries, have helped.\n\nWith interest rates at very low levels around the world, some in the west see an extremely rare opportunity for high returns by tapping a practically untouched market.\n\nWe're basically among the first, earliest institutional investors. There's been recent reforms, which means that the country is opening up.\n\nAnd Uzbekistan is undergoing its own fall of the Berlin Wall moment. And there's very successful and dynamic entrepreneurs taking advantage of this situation.\n\nThe Financial Times travelled to Uzbekistan as the sole media organisation, accompanying one of the very first delegations of western investors, meeting newly appointed government ministers and entrepreneurs, hungry in the capital.\n\nSo this is now one of the very few opportunities in the world where the capital market - it's ground zero. Laws are being written. New products are being created. Companies are being privatised. They are being restructured. They're going to get massive changes in the corporate law.\n\nSo whereas that poses some challenges, of course, for investors, this is also where the opportunity lies. And that's why you have to investigate a country like Uzbekistan right now when things are still emerging, in the true sense of the word.\n\nIn the ancient city of Samarkand, entrepreneur Kamol Abdulloev runs one of the world's largest carpet factories. He is reluctant to criticise the old regime, but says the economy was comparatively closed while getting foreign exchange was a problem. Now, however, conditions are different.\n\nIt's still very early days for Uzbekistan. International investors will want to see much more evidence of reforms. But if the country continues on this path, then more western capital is likely to arrive."

  "text": "Flexible working bends outdated rules governing the time and place for getting work done. It helps employees who want to meld their career with competing responsibilities and interests outside the office. It is deemed useful to women especially, as they generally shoulder the greater proportion of caring responsibilities.\n\nIn practice, however, employees and organisations are finding that flexible working involves navigating unforeseen outcomes along the way.\n\n\u201cI vividly remember my daughter being very young and me sitting on the side of the pool trying to engage in her swimming lesson \u2014 and be on a conference call at the same time,\u201d says Pauline Yau, whose career as a technology consultant spans multinationals, start-ups, and a variety of working arrangements.\n\nShe has also launched a podcast series, The Flexible Movement, which explores pitfalls and successes of working flexibly. One of the obvious traps is that \u201con the day you\u2019re not supposed to be working you end up getting sucked into meetings and calls\u201d, says Ms Yau. \u201cI ended up doing 100 per cent of the role for 80 per cent of the pay.\u201d\n\nCulture matters too, she has found. At one start-up, \u201cI had to give up any desire to progress my career because there was no way I could have moved into . . . a more senior role, because I was the only one working part-time and people wouldn\u2019t have entertained that.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, Ms Yau joined tech group Microsoft as a full-time employee, working from home one day a week. \u201cIt ended up like some form of torture because it was back-to-back conference calls. This was not flexibility,\u201d she says.\n\nUltimately, her solution was to leave in 2016 to set up as a consultant. \u201cThe only way I was going to achieve the flexibility I really wanted was to work for myself,\u201d she says.\n\nI ended up doing 100 per cent of the role for 80 per cent of the pay\n\nMs Yau\u2019s decision highlights the need for employers who want to retain and attract women to assess how flexible working operates in practice.\n\n\u201cThere is evidence that people who are working part-time and flexibly can be among the most productive people in an organisation,\u201d says Jane van Zyl, chief executive of UK work-life balance charity Working Families. Yet, according to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development\u2019s Megatrends report, published in January, the proportion of UK employees working flexibly has hovered around 45 per cent since 2011.\n\nOne obstacle to uptake, says Gretchen Spreitzer, professor of management at the University of Michigan, is that some companies allow norms based on habit to develop. \u201cIf there is an unintentional culture that is around face-time or about having rigid norms about the way work should get done, that is really unhealthy for everybody,\u201d she says.\n\nThen there is the loyalty that a woman feels towards her employer after she has negotiated flexible working, which can mean she gets stuck in a role, is overly accommodating on how much work she takes on and is unwilling to complain. \u201cIt keeps them doing jobs they could do with their eyes shut,\u201d says Karen Mattison, joint chief executive of Timewise, a flexible working consultancy in the UK.\n\nSetting clear parameters helps flexible arrangements work for both sides. Sarah Thwaites, a label head at Sony Music Entertainment UK, has worked four days a week for the past 18 months in order to spend more time with her daughter. Four months into the new arrangement, she was promoted.\n\n\u201cWhen you work flexibly you don\u2019t have any other option but to be efficient, prioritise and make the most of your team,\u201d she says. Nevertheless, she had to learn to place boundaries around work. As well as worrying about whether she was devoting enough time to both child and job, she says: \u201cI do feel \u2018fear of missing out\u2019. There is always a fear that you are being judged that you are not working as hard as everyone else.\u201d\n\nMargaret Snyder is a senior manager in the audit practice of professional services firm EY in Ohio. She has four children under six years of age and works full-time with flexibility. \u201cEvery time I have come back from maternity leave there is always that growing pain of trying to figure out what works for you. It is thinking, am I there at the right times?\u201d she says.\n\nHer strategy is to be ready to have honest conversations with her boss, team and clients about what is important, and exactly when she will be available: \u201cFlexibility only really works when you have open communication with the people you work with.\u201d\n\nWe keep each other up to date with what is going on . . . we can back each other up. Trust is important\n\nSome countries are more used to flexible working than others. Carolanne Minashi, global head of diversity and inclusion at UBS, the Swiss bank, says the highest frequency of part-time work is in its Swiss business. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the Swiss culture, which is very embracing of professional mums who want to carry on working but not on a full-time basis.\u201d\n\nAccording to the OECD, with 27 per cent of employees working part-time, Switzerland is second only to the Netherlands (37 per cent) on the proportion of the population working part-time.\n\nNatascha Lander, director of UBS global visionaries and investor forum, works in Zurich four days a week, including at least one day at home, to spend time with her three children. The arrangement works well, she says, not least because management has encouraged flexible working, and it is the norm for her team, with both her male line managers also working part-time or flexibly.\n\nShe and her colleagues have developed practical measures to support flexible working. Ms Lander has regular mini-team meetings that can be dialled into or done by video conference. \u201cWe keep each other up to date with what is going on. If ever someone is out for other reasons we can back each other up,\u201d she says, adding: \u201cTrust is important.\u201d\n\nMs Minashi contrasts the Swiss experience with what she sees in the Hong Kong and Singapore businesses, where few work flexibly. A round-the-clock work culture prevails, especially for employees of western-centred multinationals, who are expected to spend a lot of evening time on business calls.\n\n\u201cUnless the culture moves forward,\u201d she says, \u201cthe working styles won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDo\u2019s and don\u2019ts of flexible working\n\nPauline Yau launched The Flexible Movement, a podcast series that explores working flexibly. Here are her do\u2019s and don\u2019ts:\n\nFor the employee\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to ask for flexible working. Be ready to offer some facts about the benefits it will bring\n\nLet your employer know you are still committed to your career\n\nIf you already work flexibly, set boundaries. It is easy to be dragged into checking emails or attending meetings outside your agreed hours\n\nBe open about working flexibly: tell people, set boundaries and make sure everyone respects them\n\nFor the employer"

  "text": "We have learnt to think of life as three stages: learning at school; being productive at work; and then a period of rest. But, like it or not, the linear three-stage life is a thing of the past.\n\nAs we prepare to work for a growing number of years, some people are trying to figure out how to manoeuvre their professional lives back and forward between learning, working and resting.\n\nIn their 2016 book The 100-Year Life: Living and Working in an Age of Longevity, Lynda Gratton and Andrew Scott write that the prospect of living longer means we will have to change the way we think about career trajectories.\n\nThey argue that there are stages in life when people want to accumulate as much money as possible, and might be happier to work longer hours. At other times, more leisure or time to focus on, for instance, family, entrepreneurship or education will be more important, requiring a career break.\n\nBut how do we know when it is time to try something new?\n\nAs soon as we split up I knew three things: I\u2019m applying to grad school, I\u2019m freezing my eggs, and I\u2019m going to Burning Man\n\nIn 2013, Danielle Wyss was a 34-year-old architect being prepared for a partner-level role at a practice in Palo Alto, California. That was when she decided to leave. \u201cIt was very scary,\u201d says Ms Wyss. She had just called off her engagement to her partner and had arrived at a crossroads where one path was largely unknown.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we split up I knew three things: I\u2019m applying to grad school, I\u2019m freezing my eggs, and I\u2019m going to Burning Man,\u201d she says, explaining how her subsequent experiences at the Nevada desert festival based on controlled chaos made her trust her instinct to try something new. \u201cI came back with a mantra for myself, which was to allow for surprise and delight.\u201d\n\nMs Wyss took a masters in business management at Stanford Graduate School of Business, a course that today costs roughly $188,000. She had saved up a bit of money and had been given the opportunity to keep working for her old firm on a freelance basis, but a scholarship she received from the school made all the difference, she says.\n\nShe would advise others against postponing a career break \u201cfor too long\u201d. If the delay is because of financial worries, she recommends applying for student loans or scholarships.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t ask, you don\u2019t get,\u201d she says.\n\nAlison McArthur was working at BNP Paribas in London as a capital markets solicitor when she started thinking about taking a break from work to study and \u201cexplore what other careers are out there\u201d.\n\nShe has no regrets about training as a lawyer, but adds: \u201cI don\u2019t think that at 21 I was necessarily in the position to make a decision about what career I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think that at 21 I was necessarily in the position to make a decision about what career I wanted to do for the rest of my life\n\nNow aged 28, she is pursuing an MBA at Oxford university\u2019s Sa\u00efd Business School, and says her studies have surrounded her with inspiring women. \u201cIt provides the role model that working in the City and other places is harder to find, because of the notable absence of women in senior management positions.\u201d\n\nIn Ms Wyss\u2019s case, her new-found self-confidence was another reason behind her decision to go back to school. \u201cIt probably took me until my mid-thirties to say to myself: \u2018I know I am good at this, and I can trust that I will be able to get hired again if I need to come back\u2019,\u201d she says.\n\nAlthough she considered working in a new sector after her studies, Ms Wyss ended up back in architecture, but this time as head of her own practice. She founded the business, Shift Collaborative, at Stanford with friends and former colleagues, most of whom were also looking for flexible work.\n\nWhat is her advice for other women thinking of taking a career break? \u201cIf you believe you can\u2019t, ask who told you that. You might think it\u2019s you, but it\u2019s probably tied to some social narrative,\u201d she says.\n\nIt is particularly difficult for women, she adds, who are told they have to change their lives at an earlier age if they want children. According to those beliefs, Ms Wyss says: \u201cAt that age [34] I was supposed to be a mum, and I was already getting old.\u201d\n\nSix years later, Ms Wyss says she has retained the belief in her mantra to allow for surprise and delight. She now has a daughter. \u201cAnd I got pregnant naturally,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s nice to know I have those eggs sitting there. You never know.\u201d"

  "text": "In the middle of a packed coffee shop on one of San Francisco\u2019s busiest streets, Ellen Pao attracts little attention. She has arrived alone, dressed in the understated jacket and trousers that are common West Coast attire.\n\nBut if the people crowding into the caf\u00e9 do not appear to recognise her, most would probably know her name. Ms Pao\u2019s failed attempt to sue Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins remains one of the most high profile gender discrimination cases the US has ever witnessed.\n\nWhen she lost her case in 2015 it seemed like the end of the story. But less than four years on, in the wake of the #MeToo movement, Silicon Valley has begun to view its stubborn lack of diversity in a different light. So has Ms Pao. As chief executive of non-profit Project Include she now works with investors and companies to address bias in the workplace.\n\n\u201cI do want to show people that I have gone through an experience that no one wants to go through,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can do it and get to the other side and continue to do positive things \u2014 just in a different way.\u201d\n\nThe jury was not persuaded that Kleiner passed Ms Pao over for promotion because of her gender. She lost friends and a career along with the case. Yet it enabled her to make a new life in activism.\n\nI was thinking: OK, if not me then who?\n\nHer decision to sue is seen by some as an accomplishment in itself: in February she appeared on stage with US actress Jada Pinkett Smith at an annual women\u2019s leadership event where she was applauded as the woman who had taken on the tech world.\n\nIf this all sounds uplifting it is only part of the story of the past few years. Ms Pao\u2019s lawsuit and 2017 book, Reset: My Fight for Inclusion and Lasting Change, describe Kleiner as a workplace where women were excluded from work trips because male colleagues thought they might kill the buzz. Public interest in her discrimination case opened her life up to extensive, often critical, scrutiny. A brief stint as chief executive at Reddit where she was asked to change the company culture was heavily criticised.\n\nWhatever negative stories you may have heard of Ms Pao, rest assured she has heard them too.\n\n\u201cAfter Reddit I just thought \u2018Urgh, how can you make a change? I don\u2019t have the energy for it any more\u2019 . . . But I felt like I had this opportunity and there were people who would listen to me and I can reach people.\u201d\n\nTrying to change anyone\u2019s worldview is not easy, particularly if it leads to a situation in which they are less favoured. But Silicon Valley is as good a place as any to try to upend the status quo, she claims.\n\n\u201cEntrepreneurs and people who work at start-ups thrive on change and are super-flexible,\u201d she says. \u201cA developer once told me that any change needs to be repeated seven times before it becomes natural. I think that\u2019s definitely the case with diversity and inclusion.\u201d\n\n6%\n\nAlthough unsuccessful, Ms Pao\u2019s case seemed to have a ripple effect. Former Yahoo president Sue Decker wrote an essay for Recode, a technology website, on why it resonated with her. Two years later Susan Wojcicki, chief executive of YouTube, published an article in Vanity Fair describing the implicit biases and gender discrimination at work in Silicon Valley. Susan Fowler exposed a culture of sexism and harassment at Uber that led to a leadership overhaul.\n\nArticles on diversity of any kind in Silicon Valley were less common when Ms Pao began her lawsuit. There were, however, many published about her life: the high salary, the past relationship with a married co-worker, the business successes and failures of her husband and his lawsuits for racial discrimination. The overall picture was of someone opportunistic and entitled.\n\nThe penalty for speaking out\n\nFine, she says, leaning forward in her chair. Being \u201centitled\u201d is what gave her the confidence to sue. She points to some other factors behind her decision: she had financial resources and her family life was settled. \u201cI felt like financially that I could afford to do it and my family supported me. And I was thinking OK, if not me then who?\u201d\n\nYet, while Ms Pao says she does not regret her decision, she is careful about recommending legal action to others. There is still a penalty in speaking out. \u201cSome people say \u2018I am worried about my career, my kids and whether I can get a job. And I\u2019m like \u2014 you don\u2019t want to do this and I\u2019m giving you permission not to. Because it is not easy and the personal attacks are hard.\u201d\n\nDiscrimination cases in the US are rare for a reason. In 2017\u2019s Rights on Trial, author Ellen Berrey found that in nearly 2,000 US employment discrimination cases most were thrown out or settled, the cost of litigation and adversarial process proving too big a barrier for employees. Only 6 per cent of cases went to court. Two-thirds failed.\n\nIn search of practical answers\n\nAware of such barriers to speaking out, the seven co-founders of Project Include, including Erica Joy Baker, then at Slack, and Tracy Chou who was at Pinterest, formed a group. Frustrated by a flood of self-congratulation by companies that had undertaken brief unconscious bias training but changed little else, they set out to identify practical measures that really would make tech an industry where more people can succeed.\n\nIn an essay describing his experience with Project Include, Dustin Moskovitz, co-founder of Facebook and Asana, the project management software company, explained that he had assumed greater diversity could be achieved by being \u201cwarm and welcoming\u201d. This passive approach turned out to be ineffective.\n\n\u201cThe primary recommendation I have is to build a real program around it, with real resources and commitment,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHis experience is borne out in data from Crunchbase, the venture capital directory, and investment database Pitchbook. Just 15 per cent of funding for US tech start-ups goes to teams with one or more female founder and less than 10 per cent of VCs are women. The numbers have plateaued in the past four years.\n\nPeople tend not to report problems because they do not trust companies to sort them out\n\nThe upside is that investors and chief executives are now more interested in tackling this lack of diversity, says Ms Pao. The challenge is that they often do not hear about problems until too late. \u201cThe question is how do you find out about problems? People tend not to report problems because they do not trust companies to sort them out.\u201d Thinking of new lines of communication that employees will trust is one of the ideas that Project Include is now working on.\n\nFor companies interested in examining their own lack of diversity, she recommends starting by looking around and asking whether factors like work hours, socialising or the way clients and colleagues are discussed exclude anyone. Go beyond diverse hires to think about the general workplace culture, she says.\n\n\u201cYou can bring new people in but if you don\u2019t have a place where they feel welcome then what\u2019s the point?\u201d"

  "text": "As a child, Claire Valoti would sometimes help out in the family business, the Alhambra Hotel in King's Cross, London. Working alongside her parents, her tasks included scrubbing the sinks.\n\nNow, as vice-president international of Snap Inc, the parent company of disappearing-message app Snapchat, she reflects on the split between work and home. \u201cI think my upbringing has enabled me to realise that you can be quite fluid with it,\u201d she says.\n\nHer own two daughters do not come to her workplace, \u201cso you automatically have some sort of distinction. However, there isn\u2019t a \u2018mummy\u2019s working now\u2019 or \u2018mummy\u2019s not working now\u2019.\u201d\n\nSitting alongside her in Snap\u2019s London HQ in Soho is her mother Martine Valoti, who has run the Alhambra with her husband since 1980. She says that the notion of work-life balance is complicated if your place of work is your home, and you share your home with your clients \u2014 in her case, the guests of the hotel.\n\n\u201cI was working when I had to and [the children] were used to it,\u201d says Martine Valoti. \u201cThey were used to me sharing my time so I think they accepted it because that was all they knew.\u201d It is an intuitive concept: children learn about the realities of the world through the prism of their parents.\n\nI don\u2019t see a distinction between work and home. I think my upbringing has enabled me to realise that you can be quite fluid with it\n\nJill Armstrong is a researcher at Murray Edwards College, Cambridge university and author of a book, Like Mother, Like Daughter?, on how career women influence their daughters. She says that for daughters \u201cthere is a lot of walking in their mothers\u2019 footsteps\u201d. According to her research sample of British women, daughters of career mothers learn that careers are rewarding, worthwhile and the norm.\n\nDespite the tendency among women to focus on difficulties balancing working and mothering, Ms Armstrong found that all the daughters in her sample felt \u201cwell mothered\u201d. This was down to their mothers being mentally and emotionally present when they were around, as well being clear about their availability and attending key events \u2014 at school when other parents would be there, for example. She also found the daughters appreciated that their mothers \u201cencouraged independence\u201d.\n\nAlthough daughters learn that having a career is normal, a working mother may not be the most decisive factor in shaping their careers.\n\nA 2015 Harvard study of 24 countries found that being raised by an employed mother was associated with a modest 4.5 per cent increase in the daughter\u2019s likelihood of being employed, although they were 19 per cent more likely to hold supervisory roles.\n\nMs Armstrong found that maternal employment is not a predictor of career success, but having a working mother is a positive and often formative experience. As well as imparting work ethic and motivation, she also found that one-third of daughters entered the same or similar careers to their mothers, compared with the 11 per cent who followed their fathers.\n\nSusan Allen Augustin and Florence Greenaway \u00a9 Julia Sch\u00f6nst\u00e4dt We were always having conversations about general politics, about women \u2014 in the workspace and more generally in the world\n\nSusan Allen Augustin, diversity and inclusion manager at the Open Society Foundations, the philanthropic body founded by George Soros, entered a similar field to her mother. Florence Greenaway was responsible for recruiting doctors from minority groups at a hospital in Boston, in the US, when her daughter was growing up.\n\n\u201cI was in non-profits and ended up in inclusion but that wasn\u2019t intentional,\u201d says Ms Allen Augustin, who attended work events with her mother and met her medical recruits.\n\n\u201cShe was never directive in the specifics, but we were always having conversations about general politics, about women \u2014 in the workspace and more generally in the world. It was never framed as formal advice, we just had conversations about what was happening,\u201d she says.\n\nMyriam Bouzouaia has kept even more closely aligned: not only is she a vet in Tunisia like her mother, Asma Bouazza Bouzouaia, but she now works for her. As a child, she saw at first-hand the pressures of professional responsibilities. After her mother set up Clinique V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire de La Marsa, the second veterinary clinic in the coastal town of La Marsa, she would sometimes need to abandon family holidays to deal with emergency calls. Now, many other veterinary practices have opened in the area but old habits die hard.\n\n\u201cMy mother is still stressed, that hasn\u2019t changed. Something not so good is that she passed that stress on to me. But that can also be good because when we stress it is [because] we want to do our work well,\u201d says Myriam Bouzouaia, who has worked at the family practice for two and half years and says she still loses sleep the night before a big surgery.\n\nMyriam Bouzouaia and Asma Bouazza Bouzouaia \u00a9 Layli Foroudi [My mother] is still stressed, that hasn\u2019t changed. Something not so good is that she passed that stress on to me. But that can also be good\n\nWhen Claire Valoti travels for work, she tries to explain to her young daughters what she does, and the enjoyment and energy she gets from her job. But she suffers guilt. \u201cI still have an old-fashioned and traditional view about how I want to look after my home. That\u2019s not all women, that\u2019s just the way I am. I\u2019ve put myself under additional pressure \u2014 to go to work and be successful, but also make sure I\u2019m running an amazing home, that the house is always spotless and the kids are all fine.\u201d\n\nShe feels that her generation of mothers are \u201cperfectionists\u201d and under ever more pressure to make sure that their children \u201care doing everything\u201d.\n\nMs Armstrong\u2019s research found that despite having working (or career-oriented) mothers, many of the daughters planned to work part-time after having children.\n\nThey were thinking in terms of the amount of hours they would give to work and the amount of hours they would give to their children\n\nShe says: \u201cThey were thinking about it in terms of the amount of hours that they would give to work and the amount of hours that they would give to their children. It\u2019s a zero-sum game that you\u2019re never going to win.\u201d\n\nMs Greenaway says she felt little motherly guilt when raising Ms Allen Augustin because she shared the responsibility with her husband and two older children. \u201cI am from a culture where we are taught that \u2018it takes a village to raise a child\u2019 so I always had support, and when I took that specific job I said I needed flexibility because of my children,\u201d says Ms Greenaway. She has just moved to London to help look after her grandson.\n\nDespite pursuing a very different career path to her mother\u2019s, Claire Valoti says her parents\u2019 approach to running a hotel has served her well in working life. \u201cIt\u2019s their own business and you saw just how much they care about their customers,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I went into a more corporate environment, I took those values. I learnt to care more from early on.\u201d\n\nOnline peer pressure While on maternity leave, Susan Allen Augustin downloaded the Peanut app, or \u201cmommy Tinder\u201d as she calls it. Users swipe up to \u201cwave\u201d and make a mum-friend, or swipe down to decline. Ms Allen Augustin found other mothers to meet up with for coffee and conversation while their kids crawled around on a baby blanket. \u201cWith our mothers, they were for the most part in the same place [that they grew up in], near to family and close friends. It connects you back to a community that [you] don\u2019t have access to.\u201d But social bonds formed online can be positive and negative. When interviewing mothers and daughters about their careers, Jill Armstrong found the younger generation were more influenced by peers and social media than their own mothers. \u201cThere is far more information coming at you [now] than there was for the mother\u2019s generation,\u201d says Ms Armstrong, who argues that this creates pressure around \u201cthe type of mother that you\u2019re supposed to be\u201d. That includes pressure on working mothers and how they approach work \u2014 or think they should. Ms Allen Augustin says you have to know your way around online. She avoids parts of photo sharing app Instagram that might make her feel she must behave a certain way. \u201cWe have all dealt with judgmental spaces in our day-to-day interactions in the real world, so it\u2019s become a community and space of safety.\u201d"

  "text": "Like many women, I devoured Lean In, Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s corporate feminism manifesto, during my toddler\u2019s nap time.\n\nBut one statement stopped me cold: \u201cI truly believe that the single most important career decision that a woman makes is whether she will have a life partner and who that partner is.\u201d\n\nWhen I became accidentally (albeit, at 39, happily) pregnant, I left my dream portfolio management job as a concession to my child\u2019s father, who took a dim view of babysitting while I jetted off to meet (male) chief executives and drink with (male) colleagues.\n\nMy personal circumstances are unusual: most women with graduate degrees don\u2019t have \u201coops babies\u201d. But leaving a job for a man is not. My departure coincided with a wave of female attrition in my division. When I started there were lots of women, but in the space of a few short years most of us left.\n\nMany of us did not leave because of our kids \u2014 we left because of their fathers.\n\nI take issue with a system that expects solutions to the dual-income household to come largely from within that household\n\nThe \u201cassortative maters\u201d \u2014 similar people who marry each other \u2014 left because their husbands did well. One, because her husband was appointed to a high-level position in the Obama administration; another, because she had two young children and a senior executive husband with an insane travel schedule.\n\nOthers of us left because it was the husband\u2019s \u201cturn\u201d to develop his career. One married into a family that owned a small business, and they relocated back to his roots on becoming parents. They divorced within a couple of years, leaving her a single parent stranded in a town with reduced career prospects. Similarly, after quitting my job and moving to a small town to accommodate my baby-daddy\u2019s desire to flip fixer-upper houses, I ultimately quit him too.\n\nTo sum up: we left because none of us had ended up with the \u201cunicorn\u201d husbands Ms Sandberg lauded in her book \u2014 saintly men enough like us to appreciate our ambition, but not threatened by our success. If these mythical creatures have careers, they are not \u201ctrump\u201d careers. In some sense they would be a version of 1960s-era housewives, whose misery was grimly detailed in Betty Friedan\u2019s The Feminine Mystique.\n\nI do not take issue with Lean In\u2019s point about the blessing of a supportive spouse \u2014 by all means, sign me up for one. But I do take issue with a system that expects solutions to the dual-income household to come largely from within that household.\n\nOur bosses were not there for the tense negotiations over travel calendars we had with our kids\u2019 fathers\n\nOur bosses were not present for the tense negotiations over scheduling and travel calendars with the fathers of our children, or for the anxious moments staring at airport displays, or for arriving home to news that the nanny is quitting \u2014 and the subsequent fight with our life partner about who doesn\u2019t travel until we find a replacement.\n\nWomen may have made tremendous progress in the workforce since The Feminine Mystique, but corporate support for their widely varying families has not kept pace. Ms Sandberg herself acknowledged this in an essay after her husband\u2019s death: \u201cSome people felt that I did not spend enough time writing about the difficulties women face when they have an unsupportive partner or no partner at all. They were right.\u201d\n\nEven my son recognises the zero-sum game too often played by working parents. He claims he is not planning to have kids, with reasoning wise beyond his seven years: \u201cBecause I\u2019ll be too busy working in my bakery.\u201d (He has decided on a career as a baker, perhaps as a defence mechanism against a mother who eschews cooking.)\n\nJoint custody: criterion for success?\n\nThanks to 50-50 custody, which blurs lines between \u201cmothers\u201d and \u201cfathers\u201d and renders traditionally gendered behaviours androgynous, my son is no stranger to the career sacrifices parents \u2014 mothers and fathers \u2014 make. And his parents are arguably among the luckier ones, professionally; the silver lining of living without one\u2019s child half the time is greater flexibility to work long hours and travel. But joint custody should surely not be a criterion for career success.\n\nOnly when companies start to think about how to address the structural impediments to career and family harmony will we be able to lay Lean In\u2019s partner directive to rest. For the sake of our grandchildren, corporate America should address these twin challenges: two-income households with kids where one income had to shrink, and single-parent homes that cannot accommodate its demands.\n\nThe writer is a bond portfolio manager at Weaver Barksdale, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School \u2014 and a veteran manager of conflicting travel and custody schedules"

  "text": "The deadline for the UK\u2019s second year of gender pay gap reporting is approaching fast. With it comes the prospect of taking stock on whether such an exercise in data gathering and analysis can help eradicate the difference in what women and men are paid, as the government intends.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of interest in the figures, because there\u2019ll be that question of how they compare to the year before,\u201d says Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, responsible for enforcing gender pay gap reporting.\n\nAs last year, some companies have submitted their data to the government site ahead of the deadline, but most have not. The data published so far for 2018 show only a slight narrowing in the overall median gender pay gap: 11.1 per cent, compared with 11.8 per cent in 2017.\n\nOnly about 14 per cent of com\u00adpanies have submitted their data so far, but when those are matched with the same reporting group from 2017, the gaps overall are narrower.\n\nAlthough the data form only a picture of the reporting so far, the worst performing sectors (excluding those with fewer than 20 employers) are: construction, financial and insurance; and profession\u00adal, scientific and technical (see chart).\n\nThere\u2019s going to be a lot of interest in the figures, because there\u2019ll be that question of how they compare to the year before\n\nMs Hilsenrath welcomes the discussion and insights generated by the exercise. However, \u201cthe key thing is what happens next. It\u2019s the data that determines the [company\u2019s] action plan.\u201d\n\nSome 1,463 employers had filed their data by noon on March 1, ahead of the April 4 deadline. Last year, when filing became mandatory for those with more than 250 employees, a total of 10,537 reported. Some found it a scramble, and a number missed the deadline.\n\nEligible companies had to report their mean and median gender pay gaps, bonus pay gaps, and the proportion of men and women in each pay quartile and receiving a bonus. They have not, however, had to publish a narrative providing context or an action plan outlining how they will ad\u00address disparities. Although businesses have been encouraged to do so by the gov\u00adernment, only one in five submitted action plans by the end of 2018, the EHRC says.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to see why they would see gender pay gap reporting as anything other than a box-ticking exercise\n\nSince the headline figures emerged nearly a year ago, the data have been dig\u00adested further. Critics have highlight\u00aded anomalies in some data submitted by employers and called on regulators to do more to ensure accuracy. They also point to inaccurate reporting of the bonus gap, and the absence of data on equity partners in businesses such as law firms. More broadly, many have concluded that the reporting requirements are too weak to force companies to help close the UK pay gap.\n\n\u201cUnless businesses see there are consequences to breaching equal pay law it\u2019s difficult to see why they would see gender pay gap reporting as anything other than a box-ticking exercise,\u201d says Maria Miller, chair of the parliamentary women and equalities committee. The committee will report this year on whether the EHRC is making the best use of its enforcement powers.\n\nThe EHRC can act against companies that fail to report or misreport their data. But there are no formal sanctions or incentives for failure or success in narrowing a company\u2019s gender pay gap.\n\nDenise Wilson, chief executive of the government-backed Hampton-Alexander review of women in senior leadership positions, believes companies are taking gender pay gap reporting seriously and that the exercise has put the problem on boards\u2019 agendas.\n\nHowever, she would like more companies to recognise the link bet\u00adween the lack of senior women in businesses and poor gender pay gap results: \u201cUnless they\u2019re actually ap\u00adpointing women into their most senior roles, nothing changes.\u201d\n\nOne welcome development is that even in sectors with a big gap, such as airlines, which overwhelmingly employ male pilots, some companies have tried to be transparent.\n\nEasyJet had a median gender pay gap of 45.5 per cent in the first year of reporting, one of the worst reported by companies overall. The airline says that while gender pay gap rep\u00adorting highlighted the problem to the in\u00addustry, it had begun reporting figures voluntarily in 2015 and set a target that a fifth of new pilot hires must be women by 2020, for which it is on track.\n\nAt the same time, gender pay gap figures can also disguise problems. Consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s own report recorded a median gender pay gap of 0.1 per cent in 2017, but this figure includes staff not employed by the six entities it reported data for.\n\nIt was identified by Hampton-Alexander as one of the companies with the lowest proportion of women in senior leadership. However, Reckitt published an action plan last year and expects to do so this year. Since 2015, it revealed, it has introduced initiatives such as flexible working and leadership development.\n\nWhile Ms Miller would like \u201ca sharper stick\u201d than she thinks pay gap reporting is providing, Ms Wilson is more patient: \u201cOnce we start to get into years three and four, if the status quo remains and companies are very poor on diversity then there has to be some come\u00aduppance,\u201d she says."

  "text": "Is the age of intelligent machines bringing gender equality nearer or turning back the clock?\n\nGemma Lloyd, co-founder of Work180, an Australia-based international jobs network for women, is proud of her engineering team in which women outnumber men. She just wishes there were more female engineers generally. \u201cIf there aren\u2019t enough women in the mix, the products won\u2019t be as good as they could be, and they certainly won\u2019t be what society wants \u2014 because women are 50 per cent of society,\u201d she says.\n\nThe lack of female technologists \u2014 only 22 per cent of artificial intelligence professionals globally are female, for instance \u2014 is a frustration for many gend\u00ader equality advocates. Some worry that the digital future will be made by men for men. They call for more female coders, inventors and investors with an eye for innovations that cater to under-served female needs, such as women\u2019s health apps \u2014 so-called femtech.\n\nSimilarly, IMF res\u00adearchers predict disproportionately higher job losses among wom\u00aden when automation displaces an estimated 10 per cent of jobs over the next two decades, according to analysis conducted on 30 countries. Women will be hit harder bec\u00adause of the high number employed in roles such as clerical work that are particularly vulnerable to automation.\n\nThe flipside is that economists expect that technology will also create roles \u2014 and some will pay well. As the IMF study highlights, however, the smaller numbers of women studying science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem subjects) risks walling women off from the best jobs. In the US, the share of computer science degrees awarded to women has fallen since 2000. In the UK, 3 per cent of female students surveyed by PwC in 2017 said technology was their top career choice, compared with 15 per cent of male counterparts.\n\nFears that AI will consign women to the slow lane do not persuade everyone. A counter-narrative is that as machines look after the grunt work, greater value will be placed on skills traditionally more associated with women, such as emotional intelligence, leading to new jobs for which many women might be well suited. Yet achieving gender balance should still be a goal for all roles, including hardcore tech.\n\nResearch by academics at Carnegie Mellon University, Union College and MIT suggests that teams with more women are better at collaborating. A McKinsey study in 2017 found that ethnically and gender diverse workforces perform better financially, implying there may be costs if men monopolise the economy\u2019s growth sectors.\n\n25 Percentage of Stem workers who are women. But only 9 per cent of leaders in those fields are female\n\nThere are other considerations. The more algorithms determine social outcomes, the more software development teams need to include a mix of men and women with different life experiences to spot when data biases are skewing the decisions. As Kim Nilsson, co-founder of Pivigo, a London-based data science business, says: \u201cWe need diversity for creativity and also to question: \u2018By doing this are we harming anyone?\u2019\u201d\n\nIf women are more hesitant than men on reskilling, they are putting themselves at a structural disadvantage\n\nTo encourage women into tech, recruiters are experimenting with how they hire. Tracy Young is co-founder and chief executive of PlanGrid, a San Francisco-based business that makes software for the construction industry, a predominantly male sector. To counter perceptions that certain jobs are a \u201cman\u2019s job\u201d, she speaks at women\u2019s networking events and industry forums.\n\nDetails, such as the design of emp\u00adloyee benefits, matter too. \u201cSomething as simple as offering good parental leave [is] an indication of how much a com\u00adpany cares about recruiting women.\u201d\n\nMichelle Senecal de Fonseca, vice-president for northern Europe at US software business Citrix, says tech companies sometimes specify engineering experience for roles that non-engineers could perform just as ably. When rec\u00adruiting for posts that sit between engineering and the sales operation she considers candidates that have worked in tech-related fields, although they may not be science graduates \u2014 management consultants, for instance.\n\nBroadening the hiring criteria has helped her more than double the number of women in the organisation and benefited clients. Rather than \u201chaving a discussion about features and functionality, [they] talk about how the technology relates to the customer\u2019s requirement\u201d, she says.\n\nTech organisations not only recruit fewer women than men, they lose them at a faster rate. Globally, women make up 25 per cent of Stem workers, according to Boston Consulting Group, but only 9 per cent of leaders in those fields.\n\nBuilding tech skills into schemes for women returning from career breaks can help narrow the gender gap, says Judith Wallenstein, a senior partner in BCG\u2019s Munich office. Women must step up, however: \u201cIf the learning paradigm that emerges is one where companies encourage employees to volunteer for reskilling and women are more hesit\u00adant than men, women are putting themselves at a structural disadvantage.\u201d\n\nEmployers may not be able to undo society\u2019s gender biases, but they can still take mitigating steps, says Work180\u2019s Ms Lloyd. This includes making tech workplaces welcoming to women, supporting schemes that teach tech to women who missed out, showcasing female technologists and promoting apprenticeships to girls.\n\nWork180 co-ordinates SuperDaughter Day, a collaboration with tech businesses that brings primary school girls and their parents into workplaces to learn about coding, robotics and Stem.\n\n\u201cThe research shows gender stereo\u00adtyping starts at around five years old \u2014 if we can break that, we can help to build the pipeline for the future,\u201d she says.\n\nBrexit: reframing opportunities for women The terms on which Britain leaves the EU will affect Britain\u2019s labour market, and with it women\u2019s career opportunities. For those in jobs already threatened by automation, Brexit could bring that closer if employers lose easy access to EU workers. When labour is tight, \u201ccompanies find other ways [to meet their needs] and that will be through automation, and women unfortunately will be more affected than men\u201d, says Michelle Senecal de Fonseca, vice-president for northern Europe at US software company Citrix. On the other hand, employers may be more motivated to develop workforce skills that machines cannot replace. \u201cIf we can offer reskilling and women are creative in going after re-education there may be more opportunities, though I do believe there will be a temporary gap,\u201d she says. Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, a UK equality campaign group, is worried about the effect of changes to employment rights, despite government assurances. If an economic downturn transpires, there could be pressure to make employing people cheaper, for example, by watering down EU-derived rules that require employers to treat part and full-time workers equally. That would hit women in the UK particularly hard, as 40 per cent of women work part-time. \u201cWe\u2019re not suggesting people will lose their rights on day one. What concerns us is that, over time, there may be an erosion and a dilution of those rights,\u201d she says.\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nThere is no reason women cannot lead tomorrow\u2019s AI groups / From Anuja Ketan, Chief Technology Officer, NewtonX, New York, NY, US"

  "text": "When Rania Belkahia want\u00aded to launch an ecommerce business in west Africa while still at business school in Paris, more experienced entrepreneurs warn\u00aded the 23-year-old against the idea. \u201cDon\u2019t go for anything too complicated with your first company,\u201d they said. \u201cAfrica is too far away. Do something simple to start with.\u201d\n\nThe advice was well-meant, but Ms Belkahia and her business partner Jeremy Stoss, whom she had met at a strategy consultancy, ignored it, packed their bags and headed to Ivory Coast.\n\nThey set about persuading ret\u00adailers in the city of Abidjan to distribute their products on the fledgling online platform, Afrimarket. They tried to register the company in France only for Ms Belkahia to find that because she was foreign (Moroccan) and a student, she could not be appointed as its chairman.\n\nYet by 2017 she was part of a small delegation that accompanied French president Emmanuel Macron on an official visit to west Africa; last month she was hailed as an entrepreneurial star by French business title Challenges.\n\nMs Belkahia, now 29, was determined to prove the naysayers wrong. \u201cWhen the door is closed, you must go through the window,\u201d she says. Brimming with energy, in a smart suit and shirt, she is speaking in her offices near Montmartre, Paris. A pile of samples \u2014 toothpaste, deodorant and cleaning products \u2014 are on the table in front of her.\n\n23 Rania Belkahia\u2019s age when she co-founded Afrimarket, against the advice of more experienced entrepreneurs\n\nDemographic trends across Africa were ripe for ecommerce, says Ms Belkahia, reeling off statistics: a fast-growing middle class is expected to surge by more than half between 2020 and 2030, and mobile internet penetration is set to reach 38 per cent by 2020. Meanwhile, online retail penetration remains below 1 per cent, she says.\n\nMs Belkahia emailed Xavier Niel, one of the richest men in France and a well-known angel investor, for backing. When he did not respond she simply repeated the at\u00adtempt until she piqued his interest. Mr Niel and other angel in\u00advestors, such as Jacques-Antoine Granjon, founder of ecommerce site Veepee, invested \u20ac500,000 to fund a pilot phase for Afrimarket in Ivory Coast in 2013. A second fundraising round followed in 2015 to expand into four more west African countries.\n\nSo far, Afrimarket has raised a total of \u20ac20m from investors, and its workforce has grown to 30 employees in Paris and 180 in west Africa. Initially it offered a curated online marketplace of goods stretching from food, beauty and home appliances to building materials and even live animals.\n\nSince then Afrimarket has added two more lines. One is helping international brands to market, sell and distribute products \u2014 it recently won exclusive on\u00adline distribution for three of L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s brands in French-speaking Africa. It has also launched a transport and logistics service that conducts \u201clast-mile\u201d delivery for third parties.\n\n\u20ac70 \u2014 \u20ac90 Average basket size of Afrimarket\u2019s half-million clients\n\nAfrimarket now has half a million clients who have made at least one transaction, with an average basket size of between \u20ac70 and \u20ac90. It processes an average 250,000 orders a month. The company had \u20ac30m of revenues in 2018 and plans to double that this year.\n\nMs Belkahia, who went to school in Casablanca in Morocco, before moving to France for university, says her bicultural upbringing has been an ad\u00advantage. \u201cI always had a foot in Europe and a foot in Africa. It has given me both perspectives and an understanding of Africa from on the ground.\u201d She travels to west Africa several times a month.\n\n38 Predicted mobile internet penetration across Africa by 2020\n\nShe initially trained as an engineer, \u201cwhich allows me to be very structured and straight to the point,\u201d she says. \u201cI do not trust ideas, I like to look at the data.\u201d\n\nLike many other start-ups, Afrimarket has performed a pivot. Initially the plan was to sell online products from African retailers to the African diaspora in Europe, before deciding to target a much bigger market: the emerging middle class in west Africa.\n\nRania Belkahia was determined to prove the naysayers wrong. \u201cWhen the door is closed, you must go through the window.\u201d \u00a9 Magali Delporte\n\nAnother big shift related to customer delivery. At first Afrimarket relied on other parties for logistics, which meant \u201cwe weren\u2019t able to control the end del\u00adivery\u201d, says Ms Belkahia. \u201cA customer who has a problem with their delivery is a customer lost.\u201d\n\nThe answer was to oversee the entire journey from sourcing of goods through to the last-mile delivery. That came with challenges of its own because many of Afrimarket\u2019s customers in rural areas do not have a formal address, and most pay cash on delivery.\n\n\u201cWe work with GPS location so that the customer gives us the directions that allow us to place a point on the map,\u201d Ms Belkahia says. \u201cThe moment the delivery person is at the site he tags the address of the customer and then this is recorded in our system for future deliveries.\u201d Afrimarket records data on distances, journey time and traffic volumes to develop its internal algorithms to optimise deliveries.\n\nThe moment the delivery person is at the site he tags the address of the customer\n\nAfrimarket\u2019s main competitor is Rocket Internet\u2019s much bigger online shopping platform Jumia, and Chinese ecommerce company Alibaba is also starting to make a play for the continent. But Ms Belkahia believes Afrimar\u00adket\u2019s curated marketplace and own log\u00adistics give it an advantage, and is pressing on with plans to expand into Guinea, Ghana, Kenya and Tanzania. She says: \u201cI want people to think of Africa and think \u2018we will call Afrimarket because they know Africa, they know Africans and they know how to operate there\u2019.\u201d"

  "text": "When Fahad Sayood found out in late 2017 that he would be eligible to take six months\u2019 leave, at full pay, after the birth of his second child, he was thrilled.\n\n\u201cIt blew my mind,\u201d he says. \u201cThe opportunity to spend that time with my family for a full six months, and then come back and pick up where I left off, was incredible.\u201d\n\nMr Sayood is head of financial risk at Aviva, one of the UK\u2019s biggest insurers. Just over a year ago, the company introduced a worldwide \u201cequal parental leave\u201d policy, under which all new parents, male and female, can take up to a year off after the birth or adoption of a child, including 26 weeks at full basic pay.\n\nIn the UK, where Mr Sayood is based, fathers typically are entitled to two weeks of paternity leave, while mothers can take up to 52 weeks of statutory maternity leave. Since 2015 parents have also been able to take advantage of shared parental leave, which allows mothers to transfer some of their leave to fathers. However, only 2 per cent of eligible parents have used the scheme.\n\nAviva says new fathers took an average of 21 weeks\u2019 paternity leave in the year after it introduced the policy, compared with two weeks the year before. Stuart Mitchell, a security controls test\u00ader at Aviva, who also took six months\u2019 leave after the birth of his son, says he would do so again \u2014 it gave him a \u201creal chance\u201d to bond with his son while his partner returned to work.\n\nIt hit me like a freight train. These are worries that women in the workplace have been facing for generations\n\nAccording to OECD research from 2013, fathers who take more paternity leave are more involved during infancy and throughout childhood than those who do not. A separate 2015 study of Quebec\u2019s non-transferable paternity leave policy, or \u201cdaddy quota\u201d, found that fathers who took paternity leave were likely to share childcare and household responsibilities more equit\u00adably with their female partners.\n\nThe Quebec study also said mothers whose spouses took advantage of the policy \u201cspent more time in paid work, spent more time physically at the workplace and were more likely to be full-time employed\u201d.\n\nLack of fathers\u2019 involvement in childcare and parental leave \u2018could be one factor\u2019 behind the gender pay gap, say researchers\n\nA Swedish study published in 2010 found that each month a father stays on parental leave increases a mother\u2019s earnings. This led researchers to conclude that a lack of fathers\u2019 involvement in childcare and parental leave \u201ccould be one factor\u201d behind the gender pay gap.\n\nCaroline Prendergast, chief people of\u00adficer at Aviva, says the insurer \u201cwanted to create a level playing field for men and women taking time out of their careers\u201d with its equal parental leave policy. Over time, the policy should \u201creduce the opportunity for bias which sometimes occurs in recruitment and promoting talent, particularly [for] women\u201d, she says.\n\n\u201cWhat we have noticed with men who are taking paternity leave, by asking the same questions that women tend to ask, they are getting to understand what it feels like,\u201d she says. \u201cThe simple thought process of going through those questions will help reduce bias when people go on leave for a period of time.\u201d\n\nMr Sayood recalls that after his initial excitement at the possibility of six months\u2019 leave, he became worried about taking so much time off. \u201cWould my job be safe? What would it mean for my career? How would it impact my team?\u201d Then, he adds: \u201cIt hit me like a freight train. These are worries that women in the workplace have been facing for generations.\n\n\u201cIt is all well and good to try and empathise with others, but actually being there, in those shoes, having to face it, really opened my eyes to the issues that my female colleagues had been facing,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile few employers offer such generous paternity leave for new fathers, Aviva is not the only company to expand its benefits in recent years.\n\nSince 2016, Spotify, the Swedish music-streaming company, has offered its male and female employees six months of parental leave, at full pay, at any point up to their child\u2019s third birthday.\n\nEtsy, the Nasdaq-listed crafts online marketplace, also offers new parents 26 weeks of fully paid leave, at least eight of which must be taken in one block in the six months after the birth or adoption of a child, with the remainder taken before the child\u2019s second birthday.\n\nMandatory paternity leave\n\nHumanyze, a US analytics company, offers new parents less time off \u2014 12 weeks at full pay \u2014 but has taken an arguably more aggressive stance by mandating that all new mothers and fathers take the leave.\n\nGregg Carman, head of global commercial operations, says the decision to require leave was based on empirical evidence about what was good for both individuals and companies.\n\n\u201cThe data suggest that both mothers and fathers of newborns getting mandatory leave, getting that time to bond as a family [and] support each other, without the distractions of the workplace, have a direct relationship to employment engagement and satisfaction, loyalty to the company, as well as productivity and work ethic,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cA mandatory offering by our chief executive was not seen as a forced exercise, more as an affirmation about how important we think it is.\n\n\u201cThis is something [new parents] should take . . . It doesn\u2019t show up in the dollars of the budget but does in the performance and output at the end of the year,\u201d he adds."

  "text": "Andrea Mitchell has been a luminary of lunchtime television in America for a decade, hosting a popular MNSBC news show. No wonder: she is smart, with expertise in foreign and domestic policy, and has an attractive, warm demeanour.\n\nShe is also, at 72 years old, well past the age that many Europeans \u2014 and, to a lesser extent, Americans \u2014 would have retired.\n\nShe is not alone. Lesley Stahl is a star of US television journalism at 77. Judy Woodruff is anchor of PBS NewsHour at 72; Oprah Winfrey is a media entrepreneur at 65; Gayle King, breakfast show host, is 64, while Christiane Amanpour, another host, is 61. Maria Bartiromo and Mika Brzezinski are a more youthful 51.\n\nYes, in recent months there has been a buzz about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 29-year old Congresswoman from New York who is shaking up leftwing politics. But it is actually Nancy Pelosi, House speaker, who dominates Democratic policymaking \u2014 and the television screens \u2014 at 78. Her fellow Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, wields huge influence at 85. Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand are campaigning to become the next Democratic presidential candidates, at the ages of 58, 54 and 52, respectively.\n\nBeyond politics, Janet Yellen, former Federal Reserve chair, is a prominent face on television screens at 72.\n\nThe presence of these older female faces in the US public sphere is both striking and thrilling \u2014 at least for a 51-year-old woman, like me, who grew up in England\n\nOn one level, this should not be surprising. Women make up half the population and have a life expectancy of 81, compared with 76 for men, and America\u2019s elite circles \u2014 not just television screens \u2014 are brimming with men in their sixties, seventies and eighties, including the president, who is 72.\n\nBut on another level, the presence of these older female faces in the US public sphere is both striking and thrilling \u2014 at least it is for a 51-year-old woman, like me, who grew up in England. In my childhood, I saw only two middle-aged female faces regularly on television who commanded influence and power: Margaret Thatcher, the late prime minister, and Queen Elizabeth II. The other women on TV \u2014 or in the public eye generally \u2014 were mostly youthful newscasters or actresses.\n\nTo some extent, that remains the case in British media. Yes, there are now plenty of middle-aged women in the public sphere: in politics, just think of prime minister Theresa May, or Amber Rudd, a senior minister. But while older women have become stars with lifestyle shows, such as the cook Mary Berry, it is older men who host news shows. Emily Maitlis, host of BBC\u2019s Newsnight, is an exception \u2014 but at just 48, she is a mere kid compared with Ms Mitchell or Ms King.\n\nAlmost none has grey hair, one exception in Washington being Frenchwoman Christine Lagarde\n\nWhy? A cynic might argue that the longevity of women on US television partly reflects improvements in plastic surgery and other cosmetic enhancements. Older women in the public eye in America tend to look fabulously youthful. Almost none has grey hair, one exception in Washington being Frenchwoman Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, who sports stylish grey hair and wrinkles.\n\nAnother aspect that might explain the transatlantic difference is that while the UK elite considers it normal to retire in their early sixties, this is not the case among its US counterparts. On the contrary, in keeping with America\u2019s spirit of reinvention, it is now normal in Washington and New York for middle-aged people to relaunch themselves repeatedly in different career realms.\n\nAppearing on television at 72, in other words, reflects a wider zeitgeist.\n\nA third factor perpetuates this: demonstration effect. TV executives used to blame the lack of older women on their screens on audience taste: they would, it was said, be less popular than younger female presenters and not command the same credibility as men. There was probably some truth to that: precisely because older women were so invisible, audiences found it jarring to see them on screen.\n\nThe subliminal message, in terms of raising female ambition, is huge\n\nBut American television has shown that what seems odd in one generation can quickly become normal in another: these days the older women are not just accepted by audiences, but are very popular, too. That creates a self-reinforcing dynamic: every time a girl switches on a television, she can see visual inspiration on the screen and a message that it is entirely normal for a woman to have a voice \u2014 at any age. The subliminal message this sends, in terms of raising female ambition, is huge.\n\nThis in itself will not change the world, let alone rectify all the other gender problems. And, yes, there is still much further to go: true equality on screen would entail having plenty of women who are not obliged to look glamorous at any age \u2014 some channels still feature a preponderance of youthful blondes. But the fact that Ms Mitchell, Ms King or Ms Bartiromo are still appearing on American screens represents progress. We should cheer it \u2014 whatever our age.\n\nThe writer is US managing editor"

  "text": "Tomo Koizumi\n\nIn a climate in which clothes must have a \u201cmessage\u201d, especially in New York, Tomo Koizumi\u2019s dresses were refreshingly absent of agenda; a series of huge, voluminous ruffled dresses in pretty pastel colours all fabricated in a Japanese polyester organza and inspired, according to the designer, by \u201cabstract paintings, and the colours you see at magic hour when looking at the sky\u201d. They were extravagant and costume-y. Not many of them were very wearable, I watched the Game of Thrones actress and sometime model Gwendoline Christie negotiate the staircase in a spectacular rainbow ruffled jumpsuit with my heart in my mouth. But the show put a smile on people\u2019s faces. It was pretty and fabulous, and fun.\n\nHaving snagged all the headlines, and the social media feed, one wonders what will happen next? Koizumi, a 30-year-old, based in Tokyo, is ordinarily a costume maker for Asian pop stars and celebrities, plans to launch ready-to-wear as a fully realised business very shortly, previously, he\u2019s been making things to order. And he plans to show again, though he isn\u2019t quite sure where. Backstage, after the show, he seemed almost incredulous that it had happened. On that night at least, Koizuma enjoyed his own magic hour.\n\nTomo Koizumi \u00a9 Jo Ellison\n\nBurberry\n\nRiccardo Tisci threw absolutely everything at his second show for Burberry, which united the disparate themes of what he considers quintessential Britishness and delivered looks to suit everyone, from the ladies and gentlemen of the aristocracy to the city bankers and the kids on the street.\n\nThe show, called \u201cTempest\u201d, kicked off with the News at Ten soundtrack and an early Nineties broadcast about the rise of rave culture. And then the dance beats started pumping and the ravers arrived. They wore faux-fur coats, off-the-shoulder corset tops, parkas, puffa duffels, sneakers and tracksuits. They were followed by a series of more \u201cgrown-up\u201d looks \u2014 a beige interlude of deconstructed trenches, embellished car coats, pleated skirts, printed shirts and crystal-strewn pumps.\n\nIt had energy and humour, and though it was at times slightly overwhelming, it was spiked, like the soundtrack, with big hits \u2014 I especially liked the faux-fur lined duvet quilts with a silk print illustration, a black duster coat with oversized patch pockets and the tweedy car coat worn with driving gloves.\n\nIn spirit, the show was a fine one. Tisci, who arrived in London from Italy as a teenage student, remains enamoured of the city as he found it in the early Nineties. His enthusiasm for that era and his enduring affection for London is infectious. Lord knows, we need some love right now.\n\nBurberry \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBurberry \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBurberry \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nGucci\n\nAlessandro Michele\u2019s AW19 collection for Gucci was in part an explanation \u2014 or at least an exploration \u2014 of the authentic \u201cperson\u201d and the different masks we wear. \u201cI used the metaphor of mask to explore garments and what they say about us in real life,\u201d he said of his collection, which used elements of costume with quotidian clothes.\n\nHis catwalk featured heavy crucifixes, three-piece suits and pointed studded collars \u2014 a sign of defence and an emblem of servility. \u201cI try to stick to the rules, and to comply with the rules,\u201d he said of the collection\u2019s contradictions and his personal tastes. \u201cBut I have a wild side. And I can be very aggressive when I want to express myself.\u201d\n\nAs with any Gucci show, this was one with many faces. Several of the looks \u2014 with their balloon-shaped trouser legs and shirt bibs in ruffled lace recalled the clothing of a clown. The models wore latex tears \u2014 like a Pierrot\u2019s. The women carried sneakers, a self-conscious informality. The suiting, pointedly formal and worn with waistcoats and super-wide ties, seemed to suggest that the office look is no less of a guise.\n\nMichele makes no apology for his vision. Nor for his wilder side. But as he made clear after: the masks and bondage collars will not be going on sale.\n\nGucci \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nGucci \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nGucci \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBottega Veneta\n\nSo, the billion dollar question, did Daniel Lee\u2019s new Bottega Veneta look like old Celine? The 32-year-old, largely unknown, Englishman was appointed to the house by Kering last June. Previously director of ready-to-wear design at the LVMH-owned Celine, where he worked with Phoebe Philo, Lee helped steer the brand to revenues of around \u20ac800m and cultivated a devout tribe of female clients.\n\nDie-hard fans will have recognise many of his signatures in this his first Bottega Veneta show \u2014 the loopy knitwear with its circular cutaway panels, the heavy soled elasticated Chelsea boots, the scoop-necked tops and the play on a bourgeois sensibility \u2014 corporate tailoring, minimal outerwear, blouses \u2014 with more subversive elements, such as ruched tulle eveningwear and leather bra-lets, shot through.\n\nBut this was a far tougher, more complicated collection than I expected. While the menswear was more minimal and straightforward, the women\u2019s was ambitious in design: a quilted skirt, in turquoise, folded at the sides and fastened with a chain; thick quilted biker trousers; tailoring that mimicked the house\u2019s famous intrecciato weave; a series of mirror-embroidered dresses and shirts. There was a lot going on.\n\nBottega Veneta \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBottega Veneta \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBottega Veneta \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nPrada\n\nMiuccia Prada\u2019s collection for Prada was mostly black, staged on a jagged, spiked, sponge floor, sparsely lit, and rather angry. The models wore dark wool separates, tweeds, flak jackets, sparkly shoes and lace. Dresses with the classic Prada sweetheart neckline were fashioned in a raw grey tweed. A rose print motif was encircled by thorns. The models had Wednesday Addams hairstyles but they just as easily recalled Greta Thunberg, the Swedish 16-year-old climate change activist, who also has waist-length braids.\n\nPrada said her collection was about fear, and the threat of war \u201cin general\u201d. And romance.\n\nAnd, indeed, this was a show of extremes. It was dark and light, rebellious and romantic. It featured stompy, heavy boots and a goth-metal soundtrack (spliced with campy horror themes such as The X Files) mixed with flashes of deep femininity \u2014 lace veils, crystal embellishments and rose adornments (some, stuck on outfits in wilting silk bouquets). It\u2019s dark energy was exciting \u2014 the clothes were better still.\n\nPrada \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nPrada \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nPrada \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBalenciaga\n\nThe Balenciaga set was a vast black box that stank of asphalt. The collection reeked of street. It was brilliant, bold and contemporary \u2014 and there wasn\u2019t a sneaker to be seen.\n\nIn a season that has been big on retro references and the allure of the bourgeoisie, Demna Gvasalia\u2019s modern take on Paris style made for a powerful statement. There was lots of sober suiting, casual outerwear and simple evening dresses, but the cuts and the couture sensibility ensured no two looks (and there were more than 100 of them) were quite the same. It was also a meditation on what is relevant in fashion, a world where the water bottle has been elevated to new luxury status, and the synthetic puffa is more valuable \u2014 and desirable \u2014 than a fur. At Balenciaga, models slung bottle bags around their bodies, and carried bags that could manage a supermarket run. \u201cI like people who like shopping,\u201d deadpanned Gvasalia of his shoppers. \u201cI depend on people shopping for my job.\u201d\n\nGvasalia\u2019s show dripped with clever details, while offering new takes on the basics and tailoring tricks that made you stop and stare. The shoulder, a feature of AW19, was pinched, volumised and pinned from behind. My favourite look of the season so far? An otherwise boring sweater with a suspended band that hovered implausibly above the collar. Worn with a pair of charcoal trousers and a red polka dot tote, it hit that G-spot where function meets true fashion and makes four weeks of shows feel more worthwhile.\n\nBalenciaga \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBalenciaga \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBalenciaga \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nCeline\n\nHedi Slimane enjoys starting his Celine shows with pyrotechnics worthy of rock concerts, against a soundtrack of resolutely un-Shazam-able origins. Out back of Les Invalides, the music of the newer-than-new band Embrasse Moi, composed especially for the show, belted out as a panorama of bevelled mirror slowly lowered to the floor, a female figure poised, motionless, in the middle.\n\nIt was a hell of an entrance. The really remarkable thing, however, were the clothes she was wearing: and it takes a lot to overshadow a woman lowered to earth in a gravity-defying vitrine. Slimane sent out his Celine woman dressed in pleated culottes, a sharp-shoulder blazer, a deftly knotted silk scarf, knee-high boots. In short, Slimane had changed the record. It was invigorating, energising, engaging \u2014 and, possibly, the best show of his career to date.\n\nThe looks were akin to Celine past \u2014 not recent but, rather, Seventies Celine, when the label was known for dressing French women with a horsey, thoroughbred respectability, and its boutiques first propagated worldwide.\n\nThis Celine look was utterly convincing. These clothes looked great \u2014 expertly tailored, in expensive fabrics, with an aesthetic identity perfectly honed and polished. They were in such good taste, they floored you, made you want to use old-fashioned words to describe them, such as \u201cchic\u201d, which they were. They look like how people will want to dress. They were satisfying, and commercial in the best possible sense \u2014 which is, eminently desirable. If this collection was a record, it would be a hit \u2014 a hit, full of future greatest hits.\n\nCeline \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nCeline \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nCeline \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nSaint Laurent\n\nThe models aren\u2019t getting any bigger at Saint Laurent, but at least they\u2019re taking up more space. In the shoulders. Designer Anthony Vaccarello said that everything in his show for the Kering-owned label \u201chad started from the shoulder . . . to give a sharp sophistication to the liberated impulse of desire\u201d.\n\nIndeed. The construction, set slightly behind the shoulder and then padded, and exaggeratedly high, was certainly alluring. Vaccarello had channelled the spirit of the Eighties, and the energy of the house icons such as Bianca Jagger, Catherine Deneuve and Betty Catroux, to find his silhouette, and it seems so right for now.\n\nThe first look was the best one. Saint Laurent women are designed to look daunting, and this broad, in her herringbone overcoat with big lapels, barely there top and high-waisted satin trousers looked as dangerous as hell.\n\nA small change, maybe, but this new shoulder shape, as well as the more avowedly Eighties sensibility seemed significant. A recalibration for the designer who succeeded Hedi Slimane at Saint Laurent in 2016 and who has endured endless comparison ever since. This collection looked to be tilting in a new direction but there were still bountiful numbers of the bestsellers here \u2014 micro-mini cocktail dresses, hot pants, chiffon blouses \u2014 and just as well considering Saint Laurent has just recorded its 20th quarter of successive growth and is set to hit \u20ac2bn in revenues this year. But it was the other stuff \u2014 a tiered, ruffled skirt in black leather with a button fastening down the front, a sequin top with chinoiserie-style flowers, the coat, the coat, the coat that got my heart racing here.\n\nSaint Laurent \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nSaint Laurent \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nSaint Laurent \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nChanel\n\nThere was a one-minute silence before the start of the Chanel show, a moment to reflect on the 36 years of service Karl Lagerfeld devoted to the fashion house. Sixty seconds in which to marvel at his sense of showmanship: in his last instructions he had staged his show in a snowy Alpine wonderland. Dubbed \u201cChalet Gardenia\u201d, it featured 12 Alpine huts with actual smoking chimneys, a mountain cyclorama and real pine trees.\n\nWith its shearling snowboots, sweeping skirt lengths and Alpine flavours, this last show was a riddle. Were the motifs a final acknowledgment that the designer might indeed have had a sentimental side? Was this his Rosebud moment?\n\nOr was it a homage to Coco Chanel who conceived her famous blazer when she spied a bellboy on a holiday to Salzburg and the Alps? The full tweed coats and ski-slope knitwear here seemed to play on that era\u2019s Thirties tropes.\n\nOr had he just conjured up a mountain, and the kind of chocolate-box vista that has a global brand identity itself? The romantic Alpine landscape is beloved by clients in all sorts of different markets, and let\u2019s not forget the next Winter Olympics will take place in Beijing in 2022. Yes, Lagerfeld was a romantic. But, he was pragmatic, and a German. And also had an extraordinary business head.\n\nThe Chanel house will continue as it has done. And yet, to imagine future shows without Lagerfeld\u2019s theatrics seems inconceivable.\n\nChanel \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nChanel \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nChanel \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nLouis Vuitton\n\nFor his AW19 womenswear collection for Louis Vuitton, Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re rebuilt the Pompidou. At the Louvre. As you do.\n\nThe set, by Renzo Piano, the architect who conceived the Pompidou Centre with Richard Rogers in the 1970s, was a comment on the \u201cbeauty of controversy\u201d and the Louis Vuitton designer was pretty relaxed about the fact not everyone would like what they saw. The show was an Eighties medley of \u201cmuseum people, goth gangs, street dancers and fashion groups\u201d, as one might have observed from the Caf\u00e9 Beaubourg in the days before Instagram, when real life people watching was still in vogue. And it was pretty extreme \u2014 like no real people I\u2019ve ever seen. One model wore a tweed dress with a leopard-print capelet, like a fashion superhero. A pink flowery dress with a bouncy skater skirt, belted waist and a ruffle yoke might be described as \u201cSloane Ranger on acid\u201d. The women wore sensible flat shoes for getting around in \u2014 I was touched to see a late-Eighties style of lace-up with a pinched trim around the toe we dubbed \u201cpiss catchers\u201d at school \u2014 but overall the looks were fairly otherworldly. I was most taken with a crafty micro-floral cape ensemble which looked like Laura Ashley meets Marvel\u2019s villainous Loki.\n\nWith its leather all-in-ones, chequerboard minis and romantic florals, the show was many things. Ghesqui\u00e8re described it as a celebration of \u201cself-expression\u201d. Bourgeois it was not. Nor was it conservative, or stripped back, or pared down, or any other of the buzzwords of the season. As the looks emerged, each one more eccentric than the last, I thought of the brand\u2019s many celebrity ambassadors \u2014 including the actresses Emma Stone, Alicia Vikander and Catherine Deneuve \u2014 and which styles on the runway we might see them wear in future. Perhaps Deneuve will opt for the leather ruffled ra-ra skirt or a biker-style blazer? Will we be seeing Stone in a Mondrian-style sweater with high-waisted leather trousers and a pair of pixie boots?\n\nBut these clothes helped tell the long-held Louis Vuitton story \u2014 that today\u2019s women should be modern, always in motion and strong. They ticked all the codes of the brand, they\u2019ll take a while longer to understand.\n\nLouis Vuitton \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nLouis Vuitton \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nLouis Vuitton \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nChlo\u00e9\n\nThe Chlo\u00e9 show began and ended with the sound of galloping hooves. \u201cIt was a ride,\u201d said designer Natacha Ramsay-Levi of this equestrian adventure that opened with \u201cgrounded outerwear\u201d in heritage tweeds, Prince of Wales checks and twills, before progressing towards the silky dresses and sparkly blouses \u2014 designed to look \u201clike reflections on the water\u201d \u2014 with which she closed the show. The collection was dedicated to love, rage, commitment and nature \u2014 a print motif showed a couple holding hands, although their relationship is a fiction: the pair in question are colleagues in the Chlo\u00e9 studio.\n\nRamsay-Levi has faced a few challenges since arriving at Chlo\u00e9. Her vision has been powerful, feminine and seductive, but her silhouettes and fits have been too directional for some (buyers will tell you anecdotally that it\u2019s been a tricky sell). This collection, with its highly wearable tailoring, easy knitwear, work-appropriate trousers, shearling coats and bounty of flouffy dresses (which have always been so core to Chlo\u00e9\u2019s business) looked like a conciliatory effort to do more commercial pieces \u2014 and there were some thoroughbreds in here. Of the accessories, the bags and jewellery were grabby, while the boots \u2014 a kind of hybrid hiking sock and Seventies loafer \u2014 were among the best I\u2019ve seen so far.\n\nRamsay-Levi\u2019s Chlo\u00e9 is a confident one. And justifiably so: I love her aesthetic. But she needs a winning run. The horses were galloping, but this was more reined in.\n\nChlo\u00e9 \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nChlo\u00e9 \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nChlo\u00e9 \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nLoewe\n\nPerfection, polish, precision, pared down \u2014 there were a lot of p-words at Jonathan Anderson\u2019s show for the LVMH-owned house of Loewe. To quote Larry David it was prettay, prettaaaay good.\n\nAnderson has had a terrific AW19 season; he already stole all the plaudits in London where he does his second job as creative director of his own small namesake brand. But where, at JW Anderson, his clothes were voluminous and wide, at Loewe the mood was more exacting and the mood was more refined. All the blousey craft elements, the \u201chand\u201d touches that define his vision of Loewe, were still present, but they were more carefully integrated rather than patched through the design: a knitted sweater was woven with an organza skirt; Elizabethan lace panels hung in jabots from a shirt.\n\nIf there were Tudor references here they were deliberate. Anderson\u2019s starting point for the collection had been the 16th-century miniatures by Nicholas Hilliard at the National Portrait Gallery. \u201cThey were the selfies of their time,\u201d he said blithely of their influence. \u201cBut also, I love the idea of something small, around which you have to pay attention to see the beauty of the art.\u201d\n\nLike the miniatures, the excitement here was in the details \u2014 the sculpted tailoring, the dreamy coat shapes, and the slightly bustled skirts. It stood up to closer scrutiny, but no two looks were quite the same. Neither were they boring \u2014 only Anderson would put a paisley scarf dress with a grey rib-knit trouser and a scarlet elfin loafer \u2014 which I loved. Anderson has a gift for commercialising \u201cugly\u201d that recalls Phoebe Philo while working at Celine. And his taste is persuasive: a Weekend at Bernie\u2019s blazer in multicoloured checks, tricorn Twenties-era millinery and feather boas made for the wild card wonders here.\n\nAs Anderson will tell you, Loewe, is doing \u201cvery very well\u201d. His empire is building in momentum. And his brands are going from strength to strength. Another p-word \u2014 purchase. This was an unqualified success.\n\nLoewe \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nLoewe \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nLoewe \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nAlexander McQueen\n\nFor a long time after the premature death of its founder, in 2010, Alexander McQueen was frozen in the image of Lee McQueen. Designer Sarah Burton has worked exhaustively in the interim to honour his legacy, and his vision, and quite brilliantly so. But with more recent collections you get the sense that she is ready to step forward with the business. And with the opening of a huge new London flagship store and a confident chief executive, Emmanuel Gintzburger, who arrived in 2016, things are quickly moving on.\n\nNot so much creatively, thank goodness. The McQueen silhouette and style in which the brand was founded is still 100 per cent authentic, and Burton\u2019s AW19 collection was no different in that respect. But there seemed to be more focus on the balance in the offering. This collection opened with a clutch of daywear and suits, all fabricated in heritage fabrics sourced from northern British mills. The McQueen suit is famous for its exaggerated English shoulder, and a very lean line. These suits, in charcoal grey, with drapey asymmetrical hems and feminine details, were more than fit for purpose, they were sublime.\n\nOf course, no Alexander McQueen show under Burton would be without magical moments, and it wasn\u2019t long before the sober suiting and knitted daywear took on a very different guise. Jacket sleeves started blooming, hems peeling and one suit metamorphosed into a rose. Burton had gone on a tour of her home country to find her inspiration, and her narrative about the beauty of northern manufacture and our once proud woollen mills (now tragically dwindled, and perhaps more so after Brexit) was brought to life quite brilliantly here.\n\nAlexander McQueen \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nAlexander McQueen \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nAlexander McQueen \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nWith her collection of fluid tailoring, lipstick red dresses, and silk blouses and tweedy coats, Victoria Beckham\u2019s AW19 was arguably her best yet. \u201cIt\u2019s for a lady, who isn\u2019t ladylike,\u201d she said of the collection. \u201cWe looked at things our customer always wants, but found new ways to show them. Without being too tricksy.\u201d\n\nThe trousers were looser and tapered at the ankle, there were lots of heritage-style blazers and pastel polo necks. Skirts fell in flattering lengths to mid-calf, and were worn with the same scarlet sock boots, with a peep two. Are you ready to put your toes on show? \u201cShe might be a lady,\u201d said Beckham. \u201cBut I think she\u2019s a little bit naughty.\u201d\n\nWas the show more successful because she\u2019s a woman who understands the dilemma of modern workwear? Or because she\u2019s got a great team around her? Or because, as a celebrity with nearly 25 million followers, she\u2019s got an exceptional insight into what women really want. And she listens to them, too. She let slip at the preview that one of her earliest jobs was working in market research; it\u2019s an experience that\u2019s come in super handy since. Whatever it is, the elements all came together brilliantly well.\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nJo Ellison will be hosting the FT\u2019s Business of Luxury Summit in Madrid on May 19-21.

  "title": "Ralph Lauren on 50 years of defining American style",
  "authors": [],
  "text": "If F Scott Fitzgerald wrote the great American novel with The Great Gatsby, Ralph Lauren can be said to have assembled the great American wardrobe. And although Fitzgerald died in 1940, just a year after Lauren\u2019s birth, you could say they collaborated when Lauren dressed Robert Redford for the 1974 film adaptation of the book.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it has become something of a clich\u00e9 to look for elements of Gatsby in Lauren: the name change (from Gatz to Gatsby and Lifshitz to Lauren), the lavish houses, the elegant cars\u2026 You might also add the cultivation of an air of mysterious isolation. Gatsby was disinclined to socialise at his parties, and likewise Mr Lauren is a difficult man to pin down. Knowing that the 50th anniversary celebrations of his brand were coming up, I started discussing the possibility of an interview in spring 2016. Two years and three changes of PR personnel later, I boarded a plane to New York.\n\nThus, June 2018 sees me standing outside Lauren\u2019s Madison Avenue HQ when a black Bentley pulls up and a halo of white hair atop a pale linen ensemble emerges, looking for all the world as if he has stepped off Corsair III, JP Morgan\u2019s yacht, sometime around 1900, at the zenith of America\u2019s Gilded Age: the jacket, with a belted, pleated back, has a frayed collar betokening a patrician carelessness. Lauren speaks softly and kindly. He is so gracious and generous with his compliments that it is easy to forget you are in the presence of a living national monument. It is as if the Empire State Building, the Golden Gate Bridge and everything in-between have been compressed into this avuncular septuagenarian. He long ago transcended the world of fashion, where he began selling ties 50 years ago, to become the embodiment of America\u2019s positive national identity.\n\nThe anniversary has been greeted with revivals of favoured collections from the past and special editions of everything from watches to cowboy boots. Celebrations will climax on the evening of September 7, in Central Park, where Lauren will show his 50th anniversary collection, but as I \u2013 and you too, gentle reader \u2013 will be attending the FT Weekend Festival in London, he is giving How To Spend It a preview of the highlights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever many collections he has prepared, his eye is still pin sharp on details. As models come and go, he halts this synoptic d\u00e9fil\u00e9 to dilate for a minute on, say, the size of a belt buckle or the type of braiding on a cuff. He designs for an eternal woman, \u201ca girl who knows how to handle herself and puts herself together like nobody else does. She has the confidence to say, \u2018This is how I\u2019m going to wear it\u2019. She doesn\u2019t follow trends. She\u2019s an individual.\u201d\n\nThe collection is a sumptuous celebration of half a century of defining the American look: leather jackets to ball gowns, feminine to military, safari to country club, Jazz Age flapper to Haight-Ashbury hippie. He wants to dazzle his fans with pieces so individual they experience a \u201c\u2018Where did you get that?\u2019 moment I would call the ultimate luxury.\u201d On cue, out walks a model in a cutaway coat with period details that looks as though it belongs in a Venetian museum. \u201cThey\u2019re all unique,\u201d he says of patchwork dresses made from dozens of different fabrics, and hand-printed needlecord jeans patched with brocade, silk and other materials. Students of the Lauren oeuvre will probably be reminded of 1982\u2019s folk art-inspired collection of patchwork dresses made from old quilts. \u201cI could never buy a beautiful one and cut it up,\u201d he says, shocked at the thought. \u201cI used remnants.\u201d\n\nThere is a tenderness in the way he says he could never bring himself to dismember an old bedspread that is typical of the man. Incredibly, he has survived half a century in arguably the most fickle and downright bitchy fields of human endeavour without protecting himself behind a carapace of cynicism. Nor are you likely to hear him say anything bad about anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s not in my character, not my sensibility.\u201d Even of his recent short-lived CEO, Stefan Larsson, he observes, \u201cI liked him. He was a smart guy. He just wanted to change the whole company and I wasn\u2019t ready to do that,\u201d he says, reducing what was reported as a heated clash to a mild difference of opinion easily resolved and subsequently vindicated by the markets. \u201cI feel happy with myself. I\u2019m not an angry person. I\u2019m very peaceful. I like the people I work with; I like nice people.\u201d\n\nHis life is so arranged that his dreams remain intact and he communicates those dreams through every tie, belt, gown, suit and, of course, polo shirt he sells. Lauren\u2019s is a world in which cowboys wear dinner jackets to lead horses through snow; vintage tractors are driven by supermodels; men wear bow ties on safari; and England is the country of Downton Abbey and Wimbledon. It is about more than clothes \u2013 it is about an entire culture. Already in 1967 he told a menswear publication that he was not merely selling ties: \u201cI am promoting a level of taste, a total feeling. It is important to show the customer how to wear these ties, the idea behind them.\u201d Half a century later, the same is true, except ties have grown into an empire of top-to-toe fashion, as well as restaurants, interiors, fragrances and even Ralph\u2019s Roast coffee.\n\nRomantic is a word he uses a great deal. \u201cThey\u2019re not the typical model looks,\u201d he says of the women wearing the clothes. \u201cThey\u2019re more romantic.\u201d Coloured stones on a belt \u201chave a romanticness\u201d. A jacket evinces a \u201cromantic, somewhat British Raj sensibility, but without being Raj.\u201d He has, of course, never been to India; to do so would probably spoil his vision. Instead, he is evoking an India that exists only in a world of his imagining. \u201cThis is a world that I\u2019m very proud of. I didn\u2019t go to fashion school; this is all inside,\u201d he says, tapping his head.\n\nWith no formal training, he does not draw, but uses the \u201crig\u201d, an aircraft hangar-like space at HQ, as a giant 3D moodboard. On a visit some years ago, I saw the design studios, where 1930s America had been forensically recreated: it was like a set built to film Of Mice and Men. He does not just design a collection, but also the world in which that collection exists.\n\nOften that world is one of grandeur. Typical is his transformation of the Rhinelander Mansion, a monument to the East Coast ascendancy, into a shop. Perhaps because of this, it\u2019s become a truism to cast him as protagonist in a rags-to-rag-trade-riches fable: the poor boy from the Bronx who never owned a bicycle and longed for blue suede shoes he could not afford. \u201cI\u2019d go and look at these damn shoes every day after school,\u201d he chuckles as we sit in the Bentley on the way to The Polo Bar.\n\nThe truth is slightly more nuanced. His father was an \u00e9migr\u00e9 artist from Belarus who made a living painting (among other things) murals, and took his children to the Met to absorb the great works of art. While not rich, they had a small summer cottage. Compared to life in the Soviet Union, it was an idyll, an American dream of sorts that Lauren has continued to dream ever since.\n\nFrom early on, he had an eye for clothes. \u201cMy sister would ask me to go shopping with her,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd when I was 13, I remember going to a party and this guy was wearing a suit. I loved this suit. It was charcoal grey, very preppy, although \u2018preppy\u2019 was not a term used then.\u201d When his mother said he needed a suit, \u201cI said, \u2018I want the dark suit that guy was wearing\u2019. She replied, \u2018No, no, it\u2019s too old for you, you can\u2019t wear that\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe way he tells it, he was guided by an inner force to Brooks Brothers, where he worked in the 1960s. His epiphany came when he was 24. \u201cI was coming out of Brooks Brothers and this man passed by. He had white hair and a moustache and was very handsome. He wore a hat and a chalk-stripe suit with suede shoes and a shirt with a spread collar. It was Douglas Fairbanks Jr.\u201d Much in the way visions appeared to Joan of Arc telling her to fight the English, so the sight of Fairbanks on the corner of Madison and 44th showed him the path his life would take. While others his age were dancing to the Beatles, his role model was the swashbuckling co-star of 1937\u2019s The Prisoner of Zenda. \u201cI always admired older guys\u201d and the way they dressed. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to wear an ascot.\u201d\n\nHe started visiting a tailor called Jimmy Palazzo. \u201cLater, he would tell people \u2018Ralph drove me crazy\u2019, because I was very fussy about lapels, very fussy about every detail.\u201d It was the same with the ties. \u201cI went to the maker, watched them hand sew it. I said, \u2018Can you do it this way\u2019 and \u2018Don\u2019t press it too hard on the edges\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe fussiness paid off. Launched under the name Polo, the ties caused a sensation: apparently no one was doing wide ties in New York in 1967. \u201cStores would call me and say, \u2018Hey, d\u2019you know Steve McQueen has just bought 17 ties!\u2019\u201d He also loved talking ties with Cary Grant. In spite of being born 35 years apart, \u201cI felt a connection. He said, \u2018I used to sell ties too\u2019. He was a poor guy when he came to New York and used to walk around with stilts on the boardwalk,\u201d says Lauren, ruminatively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is easy to imagine Cary Grant feeling at home in The Polo Bar, Lauren\u2019s Manhattan restaurant; it is only open for dinner, but Lauren occasionally brings people to eat lunch in the kitchen. He got the idea when visiting a restaurant in Florence. \u201cI saw someone sitting in the kitchen; it was Marcello Mastroianni. And I said, \u2018Ah, that looks like a cool place to be\u2019.\u201d While we are here, he samples the new hotdog, made with beef from the Double RRL ranch; is shown two ways of plating it; and has an involved discussion as to whether it should be served dressed or with condiments in little pots.\n\nOver lunch he relaxes, showing his gift as a raconteur:recalling how Steve Jobs asked him to design a uniform for his staff and he turned him down, but he accepted a request from Mark Birley to design the sports kit for theBath & Racquets Club and met his match as a detail obsessive. How Fiat boss and style maven Gianni Agnelli asked to see his car collection. How he admired Frank Sinatra, another early customer and a \u201cconfirmed Polo fan\u201d, for the singer\u2019s refusal to bow to fashion.\n\nLater, he talks of the sexual harassment allegations that have swept fashion. In the acknowledgements of a lavish book released for this anniversary, Lauren writes, \u201cThank you Bruce Weber, for taking the first picture of Ricky and me and the kids in 1976 and for sharing all of my dreams and making them come to life in all the advertising campaigns.\u201d This darkness at the heart of an industry he loves pains him and he has since publicly distanced himself from Weber (who denied allegations against him in January in The New York Times). \u201cIt\u2019s one of the hardest things that\u2019s happened to our industry. I don\u2019t know his private life. But we\u2019ve known each other a long time and I love his work. The world has got very scary.\u201d\n\nOn the way back to the office, I ask whether, if he were starting out now, he would be able to achieve as much. \u201cIt was clearer for me, the world was simpler,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I did what I did, I went piece by piece based on my own taste. Today it\u2019s much harder.\u201d As he disappears into his HQ, it occurs to me there\u2019s a Fitzgerald novel with a title that fits him better than Gatsby. In a world of conglomerates where chameleon creative directors and CEOs climb the ladder by moving from brand to brand, Ralph Lauren stands for something different. He truly is fashion\u2019s Last Tycoon."

  "authors": [],
  "text": "My wife Sophie and I bought a ruin just outside Noto about 16 years ago, and now that it\u2019s inhabitable it has become our family retreat. In summer, I wake with the light around five and go out onto the terrace to watch the sun creep its way down the triangular-shaped hill in front of us. Then I\u2019ll go and pick some fruit for breakfast: we have blood oranges, figs and 600 lemon trees growing here.\n\nThe house is always full at the weekends \u2013 we have four daughters aged between 14 and 26 and there\u2019s usually another family visiting \u2013 so I drive into Noto to do the shopping while everyone gets up. I buy vegetables from a truck at the side of the road; you can pick up the tiny, salty Pachino tomatoes the region is known for and enormous boxes of artichokes for a few euros. Then I\u2019ll drop into Emporio di Pannuzzo Francesca, the hardware shop on Corso Vittorio Emanuele. It has that reassuring hardware shop smell, and the lovely Pannuzzo will happily sell you 200g of nails. I round off my shopping trip with an espresso at Caff\u00e8 Costanzo. If it\u2019s already very hot, I\u2019ll accept their offer of a small beer containing a scoop of bitter lemon granita; a delicious local delicacy.\n\nBack at home, I turn the artichokes and tomatoes into a tactile lunch, which we eat at a long wooden table shaded by bougainvillea. Then it\u2019s off to Calamosche beach, detouring via the organic winery Tenuta La Favola. They produce really good wine, including a fruity Bianco IGP Terre Siciliane that is perfect with salads. Calamosche is a beautiful sandy bay, but the real joy of it is the restaurant Agriturismo Calamosche. It\u2019s unprepossessing to look at \u2013 just a cluster of plastic tables and chairs with dogs and cats wandering through them \u2013 but the owners bring plates of sardines and orange and anchovy salad for us to share.\n\nAfter we\u2019ve eaten, we\u2019ll all go to Anche Gli Angeli in Noto for Negroni Sbagliatos \u2013 a mix of sweet vermouth, Campari and prosecco \u2013 and sit outside in the honey-coloured dusk watching elderly men strolling arm-in-arm with their wives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Sunday mornings I walk down to the river that runs through our land; it was the lifeblood of the valley for millennia, and you can still see the irrigation channels carved out thousands of years ago. The sense of history is palpable.\n\nSophie is very big on excursions, so we\u2019ll usually set off somewhere such as Villa Romana del Tellaro, south of Noto. You stumble across extraordinary architectural ruins all over Sicily, but seeing Roman mosaics in a museum means you really focus on the craftsmanship. Noto Antica, the site of the original Noto city that was destroyed by an earthquake in 1693, is another favourite. There is a proper road, but we prefer to drive our Fiat Panda up the 2,000-year-old track that zigzags its way precipitously up the hillside.\n\nWe\u2019ll have lunch at Borgo Alveria. It\u2019s sophisticated in a quirky, Italian way and the food deserves a star or two. Everything is sourced within a mile or so of the restaurant \u2013 herbs and vegetables from their own land; cheese and cured meat from local producers \u2013 and we eat what they recommend. Then it\u2019s back to the house to read. I recently discovered John Julius Norwich\u2019s book, Sicily: An Island at the Crossroads of History, which gets under the skin of the place.\n\nThe slow pace of life makes it easy to switch off, so the fact that it\u2019s Sunday night doesn\u2019t really register. We will probably have a barbecue, followed by a film projected onto the outside of the house; something atmospheric like Hal Ashby\u2019s 1970s classic Harold and Maude. When it\u2019s finished we wander into the lemon groves to look for shooting stars in the crystal-clear sky."

  "text": "What relationship do you have with money? Does it love you or leave you? Just like human relationships, some people might feel like they are \u201csoul mates\u201d, yet for others, the answer is \u201cit\u2019s complicated\u201d.\n\nThe impending tax year end and rallying cries from financial companies to use or lose your annual Isa allowance provides a useful nudge to evaluate how you and your money are getting along.\n\nWe all have different values, priorities and life experiences which influence our relationship with money.\n\nIf you feel fearful, scared or overwhelmed by money, you\u2019re more likely to develop ineffective money habits. Common ones are avoiding making financial decisions; holding too much money in low-return assets; coming out of the stock market after a sharp fall; being unable to spend money on the right things; or unable to control your daily spending.\n\nIf you recognise yourself, don\u2019t panic. People who feel overconfident about money and their capabilities are not immune to bad habits either. For example, taking investment risks which are unlikely to be adequately compensated by returns or even lead to a total loss of capital. They might feel they have plenty of time and can put off saving for retirement, or tell themselves they will save more when their income has reached the \u201cright\u201d level.\n\nOthers might overstretch themselves to buy a home in the hope that it will rise in value \u2014 as they have in the past 15 years \u2014 only to find it falls in value and they have little surplus income to enjoy life today.\n\nWhen I was advising clients, I always explained to them that while money means different things to different people, we needed to agree that for planning purposes money meant purchasing power \u2014 being able to afford your current and future desired lifestyle until you die. And as we know, that lifetime is getting longer.\n\nIf price inflation averages 2 per cent per annum over a 35-year retirement period, your purchasing power would roughly halve over that time. On top of that, we have ever-increasing expectations as consumers. A smartphone is a necessity for most people in the UK now, but no one had every heard of it 20 years ago.\n\nPreserving purchasing power and meeting rising expectations of living standards is easy while you are working and earning, because wages tend to match or slightly exceed price inflation over the long-term. For most, achieving this after you stop work or reduce your earnings will require you to invest beyond cash deposits.\n\nA healthy relationship with money means that you can balance your immediate lifestyle desires with your longer-term needs \u2014 the most expensive and non-optional of which is financial independence \u2014 and build resilience against future possible financial shocks. It also means that you need to have faith in the future of capitalism to continue to deliver reasonable real returns on your capital.\n\n52a70154-3c52-11e9-9988-28303f70fcffThe amount you regularly add or withdraw from your pot, how you adapt your investment strategy as you build wealth and how you react to market events will all influence whether you have a successful investment experience.\n\nIt\u2019s been said that investment markets can remain irrational longer than some investors can remain solvent. As the eminent academic Zvi Bodie says in his 1994 paper On the Risk of Stocks in the Long-Run, equities don\u2019t get less risky the longer they are held. You could argue that the longer the time horizon, the risk \u2014 in the form of uncertainty of returns \u2014 increases because there are so many events that can happen over multi-decade periods.\n\nCompounding returns provides some protection against future investment volatility. Albert Einstein allegedly described compound interest as the eighth wonder of the world. Re-investing dividends, interest and capital gains into acquiring more productive financial assets makes a massive difference to investment returns as the chart for the FTSE All-Share index shows.\n\nThe longer that returns accumulate, the greater the protection from the inevitable market falls that will happen. And as Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett\u2019s investment partner, says: \u201cThe first rule of compounding: never interrupt it unnecessarily.\u201d\n\nIf you haven\u2019t yet accumulated significant financial capital, the amount you add to your portfolio each year will have a greater impact on its yearly change in value than short-term investment returns. This is particularly pronounced in the early years.\n\nFor example, if you started to save \u00a3250 per month into a stocks and shares Isa, by this time next year you might have some investment growth, but it will be dwarfed by the size of your ongoing contributions. Even after 10 years, new contributions are likely to be responsible for around half the increase in fund value.\n\nIt isn\u2019t until year 20 that investment growth contributes the majority \u2014 about 75 per cent \u2014 of the increase in value. By year 30, investment growth contributes 90 per cent of the increase in value.\n\nWhat this means for younger people and those with more modest amounts of wealth is that they need to worry less about what investment markets are doing day-to-day, and focus much more on their annual savings rate.\n\nPeople who have powered themselves to financial independence will tell you that what enabled them to build their wealth was their ability to save as much as possible, as early as they could.\n\nThat\u2019s why learning to control day-to-day spending is such an important \u2014 and generally under-appreciated \u2014 skill to master.\n\nThis self-control will also pay dividends later in life. When the time comes to start to taking regular withdrawals from your capital, you will need to focus carefully on the level of income you\u2019re taking. Having some flexibility will minimise the chance of withdrawals exacerbating market falls and extending periods of low returns.\n\nThe ancient stoic philosopher Hecato advised \u201cWhat progress, you ask, have I made? I have begun to be a friend to myself.\u201d In building up and living off your wealth, you are looking for steady progress, not perfection. That way you won\u2019t just be a friend to yourself, but also become soul mates with your money.\n\nJason Butler is an expert on financial wellbeing and author of \u201cMoney Moments: Simple steps to financial wellbeing\u201d; Twitter: @jbthewealthman"

  "text": "When Margaret McCabe gave birth to a daughter, she knew something had to change. She was exasperated by the gender discrimination she faced as a commercial barrister, and wanted to make the world a more equitable place for her child. \u201cI thought that by the time she grew up, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem. But it\u2019s still a problem,\u201d she says.\n\nMs McCabe, whose successful legal career had equipped her to deal with argument, negotiation and debate, felt these skills could help to improve social mobility among at-risk youth. In 2009 she founded a charity called Debate Mate to teach debating skills in under-resourced schools in London with her now-grown daughter, Scarlett. Drawing on her experience campaigning for the advancement of women and workplace equality, Ms McCabe decided to embed gender equality training into the foundation of Debate Mate.\n\nDebate Mate\u2019s training, heralded as \u201camazing\u201d by backer Bill Gates, has been so effective in schools that it is heading into the office. It aims to bring empowerment to the employees who need it most. Clients include Rolls-Royce, Tesco, BP, the Japanese bank Nomura and the UK government.\n\nAt its core, Ms McCabe says, it is a skills programme. Learning to communicate an idea simply and effectively builds confidence, something corporate women report to struggle with, especially as they increasingly enter industries where superiors are predominantly male.\n\nIf I could float confidence on the stock exchange, we would all be very rich\n\nMuch has been said of the \u201cconfidence gap\u201d or the difference in self-confidence between male and female employees that can have an impact on their trajectories and salaries. While women outperform men in school and are entering the workforce in record numbers, half of female managers in the UK reported self doubt about their job performance and careers. This compared with just one-third of male respondents, according the a 2011 study by the Institute of Leadership and Management.\n\nBut a confidence deficit is not the only reason why men still outpace women in the workplace. Debate Mate trains female staff to master skills such as empathetic listening and information processing that allow them to communicate more effectively. Women often struggle to get their ideas across fully before being interrupted.\n\nWomen still ask Ms McCabe about the best way to negotiate a pay rise, how to deal with professional evaluations, sexual harassment and balancing a career with children and family life. \u201cWe tend to work with younger women because they\u2019re the ones that are most interested,\u201d Ms McCabe says.\n\nNomura uses Debate Mate\u2019s corporate training for young women hoping to be chosen for the internship programme that it uses to select new employees.\n\n\u201cWhat we wanted to do was enhance our very junior workforce \u2026\u2026. so they can enter into a corporate environment that can be a bit confrontational,\u201d says Sarah Vincent, head of Emea graduate recruitment. Those who participate rapidly develop skills that help them communicate more effectively with clients.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re able to articulate their ideas and take a step back to think about what they want to say\u201d, she says, and they \u201ctend to do exceptionally well on the summer internship\u201d.\n\nConfidence is not necessarily the biggest hurdle for Debate Mate\u2019s corporate trainees. \u201cI think I\u2019m pretty confident,\u201d says Sophie, a senior adviser at law firm DLA Piper who participated in the training in 2018. \u201cFor me it\u2019s about slowing things down so I don\u2019t ramble, it\u2019s about bringing it in and channelling my nervous energy, controlling both my breath and physicality. It helped me cope when things don\u2019t go according to plan.\u201d\n\nDebate training breaks down into basic principles: listening, speaking, strategic teamwork, and dispassion. \u201cThey develop what I call a third eye, and can take a step back from the situation to figure out how to get what they want. It\u2019s what the Buddhists call dispassion,\u201d Ms McCabe says. \u201cDebaters can have a discussion, they don\u2019t lose their temper, and they can make a point.\u201d\n\nIn feedback from participants in the female corporate program, 100 per cent of women said that their ability to make a structure argument increased, and 91 per cent said that their ability to speak with confidence has increased.\n\nDebate Mate\u2019s corporate training is fun, participants say, because the programme is taught through games. In one, participants walk to one side of the room or the other, dependent on whether they agree or disagree with the premise of the topic, which could be something like, \u201cshould women make up 50 per cent of UK board seats?\u201d. Scarlett McCabe says participants must argue the opposite side of the choice they make, which helps develop empathy for opinions they do not believe in.\n\nIn a \u201cballoon\u201d game, participants are placed in an imaginary sinking hot air balloon and are assigned a celebrity they must pretend to be. They then argue why that celebrity should remain in the balloon, rather than be thrown overboard to reduce weight.\n\n\u201cPeople think you\u2019re born confident or you\u2019re not, but confidence is a skill,\u201d Scarlett McCabe says. \u201cYou can trick people into thinking you\u2019re confident. Clench your bum or clench your toes, it helps anchor and ground you, and lowers your voice. Take a deep breath before you talk so you don\u2019t start your sentence with an \u2018um\u2019.\u201d\n\nClaire Pelly of Virgin Galactic has worked with Debate Mate to provide corporate training through the professional women\u2019s organisation, BroadMinded. She says women initially find that speaking in front of a group \u201cis terrifying \u2014 they can\u2019t speak,\u201d but over the course of the training, the transformation she sees is extraordinary.\n\nMargaret McCabe laughs: \u201cIf I could float confidence on the stock exchange, we would all be very rich.\u201d"

  "text": "Alumni networks exist at most large educational institutions. The biggest, like those of London Business School or MIT\u2019s Sloan School of Management, have chapters all over the world.\n\nWithin these networks exist specialist subgroups that focus on supporting women, LGBT or entrepreneurship, for example. But whether you are in the middle of an MBA, several years into your career, or even setting up a company, how can they help you? And if they are not right for you, what are the alternatives?\n\nAllie Fleder will complete her MBA at London Business School this year and says the school\u2019s alumni has an effective network which is very accessible via an online portal. Since she is starting a luggage transport business called Sherpa, \u201cI am constantly tapping that network,\u201d she says.\n\nWithin the wider alumni network is Out in Business, an LGBT subgroup of which Ms Fleder is president. Out in Business started in 1996 and was one of the first such groups, according to LBS. It is made up of current students who work with a board of alumni and it aims to facilitate connections on campus and with a diverse set of employers. \u201cThe broader alumni network is supportive and feeds into what the group does,\u201d Ms Fleder says.\n\nMs Fleder had never been a part of any LGBT groups before. \u201cWhen I first joined LBS they were the first group to reach out.\u201d Presiding over the network means Ms Fleder also has a safe space to practice her newly acquired management skills. Out in Business has been effective in helping with career development because of the \u201cwillingness of people to sit down and get a coffee and talk through their own career journey\u201d, she says.\n\nThere\u2019s a secret code among those from some schools to help each other out\n\nFor business school or university graduates, alumni connections can also be tapped when looking for a job. Angela Xu, who graduated with an MBA from the Sloan School of Management in 2016, recently used the school\u2019s network to help her make the move from consulting to director of technical product strategy at Cengage Learning, an edtech company.\n\nA Sloan career adviser put Ms Xu in touch with an alumna who was a great source of advice and even offered tips on how to negotiate her salary.\n\nBut open online networks such as LinkedIn mean that additional insights can be sought from alumni connections. Ms Xu contacted another of MIT\u2019s alumni via LinkedIn to find out what it would be like to work for the person who is now her boss. \u201cThere\u2019s a secret code among those from some schools to help each other out,\u201d she says.\n\nBut in some instances even well established networks are not always easy to access, or the events they run cover subjects too broadly to be of any real use.\n\nWhen Ms Fleder applied to New York\u2019s Columbia University she was told it had an excellent alumni association. But while on campus, she found it difficult as an undergraduate to tap into the connections the network offers.\n\nShe recalls an alumni cocktail event: \u201cIt was all men in finance and I was there in coloured pants and felt out of place. I was the offbeat \u2018funky\u2019 girl in the space.\u201d\n\nBenita Nagra, had similar feelings. She studied economics at Birmingham university and then joined the graduate programme at banking group Barclays. A couple of years in she decided the industry was not for her and set up The Abstract Bee, a homewares and jewellery business. She felt her university\u2019s network could not provide her with the guidance she needed.\n\nInstead Ms Nagra decided to join The Coven Girl Gang, an online community launched in 2018 for women who run their own businesses or freelance. It is one of numerous alternative and flourishing networks across the world.\n\nSapphire Bates founder of the Coven Girl Gang\n\nThe AllBright Club in London\u2019s Mayfair, for example, was set up last year with the aim of fostering a community of like-minded professional women to advance their careers.\n\nNew York\u2019s The Wing provides a co-working space where women can connect and collaborate, while in Paris, A City For Her was founded by an expat who found business networking events in the French capital too codified and male-dominated.\n\nMs Nagra found The Coven, which also provides online workshops and UK-wide opportunities for events and other meetups, through social network Instagram.\n\n\u201cThe Coven is so easily accessible,\u201d she says. \u201cI can log on, [post] a question and know within 10 minutes I will have 10 or 20 replies.\u201d\n\nOnce you have joined a network that suits, support will come from members sharing similar career or business issues. \u201cIt\u2019s been a total game-changer for my business,\u201d says Alison McDougal, a personal stylist and member of AllBright.\n\nThere is a mixture of ages and skillsets \u2014 from chief executives and entrepreneurs to freelancers \u2014 and with that comes a real sense of empathy among members, she adds."

  "title": "Charts that Count: how Donald Trump is weaponising growth",
  "authors": [],
  "text": "So the formula for calculating economic growth is pretty straightforward. Okay, so gross domestic product is consumption plus investment plus government expenditure plus net exports. We're not going to go into too much detail here, because today we just care about government expenditures.\n\nNow, you can divide up government expenditures even further. You've got state and local, or federal expenditures. And then, within federal expenditures you have defence and non-defence. Defence is military spending, things that go boom. That's what we care about today.\n\nSo what you're looking at right now is contributions from federal defence spending to annual GDP growth. The GDP growth numbers should not be important in American politics, because there are better ways to measure how we're doing. But it is.\n\nThat's just the world as it's given to us. Every White House gets measured on how high they can get that number. Can you get it to three? Can you get it to 4 per cent?\n\nSo we take a look at the contribution that defence makes. It's easy to see a pattern. This right here right after 2001 is the ramp up in federal defence spending after September 11th.\n\nThen, we see again during the recession, there's nothing else happening. We don't have a lot of consumption. We don't have a lot of investment. It's government spending is all there is really. Right, so it becomes the only mainstay in a stimulus.\n\nThen, something happens, two things together, in fact. This right here is the Obama administration winding down wars in the Middle East. But at the same time, it's having a fight with Congress that results in a sequester.\n\nKind of crammed it in there, but a sequester is basically a terrible arrangement, where you decide that to force yourselves to get along you're going to make very painful cuts to the military and some other discretionary kinds of funding. So they're stuck. They lift the caps on the sequester from year to year, but not by a lot.\n\nSo what we're looking at right here is that defence spending is a net drag on economic growth. Now, I'm not a defence policy analyst. I can't say whether that's a good idea or a bad idea. I can tell you that that has an effect on this number, GDP growth, that presidents get judged by.\n\nSomething happens here. In the last year, Congress has lifted the caps particularly on defence spending by a lot. So now you have a positive contribution to GDP growth. It's no longer a drag when we're looking at that number.\n\nIt's actually even more dramatic when you look at the quarterly numbers. So if you have second quarter of last year, whiz bang, 4.2 per cent. That's an amazing number. The administration made a big deal out of it, rightly so. We hadn't seen it in a while.\n\nThe contribution of defence spending in that quarter to GDP growth was .22 percentage points. Take that away, make it a drag like we did a couple of years ago, and you don't get to 4 per cent. . So this is a big deal.\n\nIn theory, the Republican party in the United States doesn't like to stimulate the economy through government expenditures. They prefer consumption and investment coming from the private sector. But there is one exception.\n\nIt's what we're looking at right here, defence spending. Barney Frank is a retired congressman from Massachusetts. He's a Democrat. Used to call this weaponised Keynesianism.\n\nKeynesianism - not a philosophy that Republicans in the United States traditionally adhere to. But it, basically, says in times of great need you need to step in as a government and spend a lot of money to make up for all that private consumption and private investment that has disappeared. What we have happening right now is what we have happening right now."

  "authors": [

  ],
  "text": "For his AW19 womenswear collection for Louis Vuitton, Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re rebuilt the Pompidou. At the Louvre. As you do.\n\nThe set, by Renzo Piano, the architect who conceived the Pompidou Centre with Richard Rogers in the 1970s, was a comment on the \u201cbeauty of controversy\u201d and the Louis Vuitton designer was pretty relaxed about the fact not everyone would like what they saw. The show was an Eighties medley of \u201cmuseum people, goth gangs, street dancers and fashion groups\u201d, as one might have observed from the Caf\u00e9 Beaubourg in the days before Instagram, when real life people watching was still in vogue. And it was pretty extreme \u2014 like no real people I\u2019ve ever seen. One model wore a tweed dress with a leopard-print capelet, like a fashion superhero. A pink flowery dress with a bouncy skater skirt, belted waist and a ruffle yoke might be described as \u201cSloane Ranger on acid\u201d. The women wore sensible flat shoes for getting around in \u2014 I was touched to see a late-Eighties style of lace-up with a pinched trim around the toe we dubbed \u201cpiss catchers\u201d at school \u2014 but overall the looks were fairly otherworldly. I was most taken with a crafty micro-floral cape ensemble which looked like Laura Ashley meets Marvel\u2019s villainous Loki.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nWith its leather all-in-ones, chequerboard minis and romantic florals, the show was many things. Ghesqui\u00e8re described it as a celebration of \u201cself-expression\u201d. Bourgeois it was not. Nor was it conservative, or stripped back, or pared down, or any other of the buzzwords of the season. As the looks emerged, each one more eccentric than the last, I thought of the brand\u2019s many celebrity ambassadors \u2014 including the actresses Emma Stone, Alicia Vikander and Catherine Deneuve \u2014 and which styles on the runway we might see them wear in future. Perhaps Deneuve will opt for the leather ruffled ra-ra skirt or a biker-style blazer? Will we be seeing Stone in a Mondrian-style sweater with high-waisted leather trousers and a pair of pixie boots?\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nGhesqui\u00e8re seemed ready to have that discussion. Just as the Pompidou Centre was reviled when it first opened, so too was he trying to push a different point of view. \u201cI wanted to remind people that what was so controversial has, through time, and the gymnastics of the eye, become an icon of the landscape,\u201d he explained of the hi-tech exhibition space. \u201cI want fashion to be exciting, a place of discovery, to offer new shapes and be controversial. I want to do fashion that takes time to understand.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nWill these ruffled dresses become an icon of the landscape? Time will tell, but Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s enthusiasm and ambition is refreshing. His collections can be confusing, sometimes difficult, but they deliver the ideas which percolate and his show is still one of the creative cauldrons from which other more commercial designers like to nab ingredients later on. It was also fun to see a designer take an already common theme and approach it in a totally different way. Eighties shoulders and statement tailoring have been massive this season, his blazers were broad and blouson through the shoulders, and his trouser shape was carrot-legged and high. Likewise with the florals \u2014 which have been another key trend. Ghesqui\u00e8re described them as \u201ccraft piece meets classic\u201d, and dedicated them to a certain type of museum woman he sees. He might have meant my mother, although I doubt she\u2019d go for these.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nMost significantly, these clothes helped tell the long-held Louis Vuitton story \u2014 that today\u2019s women should be modern, always in motion and strong. They ticked all the codes of the brand, they\u2019ll take a while longer to understand. But Ghesqui\u00e8re can enjoy the privilege of belligerence. He designs clothes that the house doesn\u2019t depend on to sell. The jewel of the LVMH group, the Louis Vuitton recorded around $10bn in revenues in 2018, and the vast majority of that business was in sales of its famous monogram \u2014 the canvas bags on which the house has built its fortune.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nGhesqui\u00e8re\u2019s contribution to that cannon has been significant, and his AW19 bag offering was a far more accessible affair: a dinky clutch bag in a patchwork of fabrications, Tambrourin, an old-school satchel, and the ladylike Dauphine Mini, with its three tidy compartments, finished in different materials, including tweed. So, yes, my eye has done gymnastics, and the more I study this collection, the less bonkers it seems. But next time you\u2019re people watching in the Beaubourg, the bags will be the icons that you see.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nJo Ellison will be hosting the FT\u2019s Business of Luxury Summit in Madrid on May 19-21.

It might not sound like a big deal, but the implications are huge. If Rome does indeed sign its support for the Belt and Road on the dotted line later this month, it'll make Italy the first of the G7, the world's most advanced democracies, to do so. That doesn't actually mean China will suddenly start building bridges in Italy, but it does potentially put Rome in line to benefit at some point.\n\nFor China, that is a massive win. The Belt and Road is President Xi Jinping's signature policy. However, China has been roundly criticised for creating debt traps for smaller countries. By that, I mean building projects that the host country will struggle to repay and which could put them in debt permanently to China. China is also accused of saying that projects are commercial when their real interests could actually be military.\n\nOne such example is a port in Pakistan that could ultimately be used as a staging post for the Chinese navy. The criticism of Italy's upcoming move has already started. The US says it is sceptical that the endorsement will bring sustained economic benefit to the Italian people. It says the Chinese programme is made by China for China. The EU is also voicing concerns, but controversy or not, the Belt and Road is forging ahead.\n\nIt's already the biggest infrastructure effort in history. The programme embraces more than 80 countries and over 2,000 deals, worth more than a trillion US dollars, have already been agreed since it began six years ago. China says its aim is to lay the foundations for a brighter and more prosperous future for everyone. It touts its own experience as an example. Put infrastructure in place and China says economic growth can really take off, just like it did back home. But opposition from America could yet hamper China's ambitions."

  "title": "How one couple designed a modern home in historic Vancouver",
  "authors": [],
  "text": "By Elsa Court\n\nWhen Laurel Murray and her husband Jonathan Greaves left London in 2015 to move closer to Murray\u2019s family in British Columbia, they could still just about afford a home in Vancouver but knew prices were rising fast. They decided to combine family resources to buy a property where they would have space to add a second home for Murray\u2019s parents \u2014 a laneway house, as they are known.\n\nThey focused their search on the historical and artsy neighbourhood of Strathcona, minutes from Vancouver\u2019s vibrant Chinatown.\n\nThey chose a single-level, two-bedroom postwar bungalow, but it stood out amid a row of pre-1900s clapboard houses. As they say, \u201cit is the least attractive house in the neighbourhood\u201d.\n\nThe postwar bungalow stands out on a street of pre-1900s clapboard houses\n\nIt will not stay that way: they are knocking it down in late Spring and replacing it with two new homes, including a modern twist on the historical house that once stood on the lot. This reverential gesture to the neighbourhood\u2019s architectural heritage is a radical approach to modern development in historic Vancouver.\n\nBut with multigenerational living on the rise in increasingly densely populated (and expensive) western cities, theirs is also a story about finding a creative solution to combat rising costs of land and property.\n\nStrathcona is a historical neighbourhood in Vancouver\n\nHome . . . for now\n\nThe Strathcona bungalow was an estate sale (a quick liquidation of assets \u2014 for example, of a deceased person). \u201cWe were only looking at things that were run down because of cost restrictions,\u201d says 38-year-old Murray, an analyst specialising in renewable energy and climate change adaptation. She is sitting on a concrete bench (a designer piece bought for a steal on Craigslist) in the dark living room which, due to the bungalow\u2019s odd layout, is an extension of the hallway, leading to the kitchen.\n\nThe couple spent months putting their stamp on the bungalow\u2019s interiors\n\nThe property had remained unchanged since it was built in 1949. \u201cPeeling back the carpet was like going back in time,\u201d says Murray. It took the couple eight months to move in, after spending almost every weekend on do-it-yourself work, learning as they went from YouTube videos.\n\nThe history\n\nMurray and Greaves went to the City of Vancouver for preliminary guidance about renovating the property, but a planner took one look at it on Google Street View and asked: \u201cIs there anything worth salvaging here?\u201d The planner called it the \u201cgap tooth\u201d of Union Street \u2014 the street on which the bungalow stands and which is subject to a preservation order.\n\nMurray was curious how a squat postwar bungalow found itself on a row of traditional 19th-century clapboard houses. The property was also depressing the value of the houses on either side, which are both covered by the preservation order.\n\nIn the city archives she found an image of a Victorian house on the site of the bungalow. The house, in the style of others on the street, had a tall gabled roof, shiplap cladding, a generous veranda typical of the neighbourhood and intricate fretwork.\n\nThe Bazley family pictured in front of the original house in 1894\n\nAccessing the Vancouver Water Works Registry and a British Columbia business directory going back to the 1890s confirmed the original house number and enabled Murray to research the family of local blacksmith Charles Bazley, originally from New Brunswick, who had lived there until 1917. After this point, there was no entry for the property in either source, meaning it no longer existed.\n\n\u201cWe think fire is the most likely explanation,\u201d says Murray. A building permit pertaining to the current bungalow \u2014 for Marie Agustino, an Italian immigrant \u2014 showed it was probably built in 1949.\n\nThe vision\n\nWhen it became clear neither the city council nor the neighbours found any architectural merit in the bungalow, it made sense for the couple to look into building a new home.\n\n\u201cOne day we stumbled on an open house day for quite a sexy, modern property \u2014 the Cube house in the highly affluent Point Grey, Kitsilano,\u201d says Murray. There they met the minimalist house\u2019s architect, Tony Robins of AA Robins, and hired him to design their new home.\n\nA fan of Strathcona, Robins envisioned restoring the historic streetscape by replacing the bungalow with a contemporary interpretation of the original Victorian house. However, he suggested a twist to the original 1891 fa\u00e7ade by giving it an aluminium finish, similar to a MacBook laptop.\n\nEverything behind this fa\u00e7ade will be modern, and the other exterior walls will be painted black to make them recede from view and draw the eye to the metal fa\u00e7ade from the street. Robins calls it the \u201cChinatown Ghost House\u201d.\n\nAn architect\u2019s drawing of the street now\n\nA drawing showing the proposed design for the new house\n\n\u2018Sensitive densification\u2019\n\nMurray\u2019s parents, who live in a restored 1990s stucco house on Vancouver Island, want to return to the mainland to be closer to their children. The idea of building them a laneway house at the rear of the new property came from a desire to limit costs, because land is so expensive in Vancouver.\n\nMurray says people started building laneway houses \u2014 which are found on the unnamed, narrow back streets behind properties\u2019 backyards \u2014 because of a housing crisis in Canada\u2019s biggest cities. This has been caused by a shortage of land, rising prices and cities\u2019 reluctance to approve high-rise apartment developments. \u201cI call it \u2018sensitive densification\u2019,\u201d she says.\n\nA laneway (right) runs behind the back of the houses on Union Street (left)\n\nThe 1,100 sq ft laneway house, also designed by Robins, will match the four-bedroom main house with gable roofs and dark shiplap cladding, and have a generous rooftop garden with a view of the coastal mountains to the north of Vancouver.\n\nThe nitty gritty\n\nThe project met city guidelines on scale, mass and form, but Murray and Greaves, who works in the energy and clean technology sector, wanted to enlist the support of neighbours before making a formal planning application, \u201cEveryone loved it, but they were telling us, \u2018The city is never going to go for this\u2019,\u201d says Murray.\n\nAs a historic neighbourhood, Strathcona has specific, and largely immovable, design guidelines. This meant the couple had to apply for a separate development permit in addition to the usual building and demolition permits, which added cost and led to lengthy delays. The application was a gamble: if it had failed they would have lost thousands of dollars in fees.\n\nBut the biggest challenge was obtaining permission for the increase in density from one to two new homes on the same lot. \u201cWe did not have an existing historic home worth preserving and, without it, the city planners did not have the authority to [grant permission for us to] build two detached family dwellings at the necessary density,\u201d says Murray.\n\nWith neighbours\u2019 support, however, they took the case to the Board of Variance, a council-appointed body that allows for flexibility in the application of a zoning bylaw and looks beyond the guidelines to the intent behind the design. The couple\u2019s gamble paid off: the case was approved in January.\n\nThe designs for the proposed laneway house\n\nBreaking new ground\n\nMurray says the board set a precedent by granting an increase in floor area ratio under the Character Home Zoning Review, part of the heritage conservation programme designed to preserve Vancouver\u2019s historic neighbourhoods. While historic renovations are allowed up to a 95 per cent floor area ratio to the overall plot size, new builds are only allowed 75 per cent \u2014 insufficient for the planned dwellings.\n\n\u201cOur two buildings take up less than 50 per cent of the footprint of the land,\u201d says Murray, \u201cbut because they are 2.5 storeys (to match the height and mass of the other buildings on our street), they make up 92.7 per cent of the total floor surface area.\u201d The board declined to comment.\n\nThe bungalow will be demolished in late Spring\n\nConstruction should take 12 months. While building costs were as the couple expected, the city\u2019s fees and associated costs caused some worry as they were far higher than they anticipated. That said, Murray says the cost of renovating the bungalow and building a laneway house will be at least C$500,000 ($380,000) less than buying a historic Victorian home on the same street, which typically sell for C$1,750,000 ($1,325,000).\n\nMurray and Greaves are saving money by building two homes on one smaller lot. \u201cConservatively, it costs C$1.4m to buy a modest plot in Vancouver, so that means we\u2019d be spending around C$3m for the land alone,\u201d says Murray. \u201cBy building on the same lot \u2014 which has additional benefits for ageing parents \u2014 we\u2019re saving that enormous cost of land.\u201d\n\nShe has found the project challenging but rewarding. \u201cPerhaps necessity and money constraints have forced us to be more creative in our approach,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have truly fallen in love with the Strathcona community and to be able to build two liveable family homes for us and my parents is worth all the hard work.\u201d\n\nImages: Andrew Querner; City of Vancouver Archives; AA Robins; Intarsia Design"

  "authors": [

    "Karl Lagerfeld"
  ],
  "text": "There was a one-minute silence before the start of the AW19 Chanel show, a moment to reflect on the 36 years of service Karl Lagerfeld devoted to the fashion house. Sixty seconds in which to marvel at his sense of showmanship: in his last instructions he had staged his show in a snowy Alpine wonderland. Dubbed \u201cChalet Gardenia\u201d, it featured 12 Alpine huts with actual smoking chimneys, a mountain cyclorama and real pine trees. It was a moment to sit in wonder. And for those who really knew him, and who have been caught up in a schedule with little time for much reflection, it was a quiet moment in which to grieve.\n\nI did not know him muchly, but I\u2019ll miss him like hell. I interviewed Lagerfeld on about six occasions, most often backstage at the shows and through a scrum of reporters all scratching for his quotes. He always delivered something spicy, either making some sensational pronouncement or voicing some new subject of disdain. He was hugely entertaining. But he could be vulnerable too: he had an unexpected need for affirmation. \u201cDid you like it?\u201d he would ask in his heavy German accent of a piece of clothing or a new construction in the show. \u201cYou did? Yes, I thought it was quite good as well.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nMore than anything, he hated nostalgia. He loathed nothing more than looking back. In a rare discussion around the idea of legacy, he told the critic Suzy Menkes: \u201cI hate the idea of being heavily remembered . . . I think things start with me, they end with me. After that, the garbage can . . . I couldn\u2019t care less\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nWith this in mind, his last show, with its shearling snowboots, sweeping skirt lengths and Alpine flavours was a riddle. Were the motifs a final acknowledgment that the designer might indeed have had a sentimental side? Had he holidayed in Bavaria in his childhood? Was this his Magic Mountain, a fictional sanctuary of creative respite from which he might escape his inevitable demise? Was this his Rosebud moment?\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nDuring his lifetime the designer was an inveterate fabulist, some might say fibber, who would mix the facts of his biography about. He never quite confirmed his date of birth, and often obfuscated details of his childhood.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nWas this all a homage to his powerful bourgeois mother, born in Munster, around whom so many Lagerfeld myths were built? Or was it a homage to Coco Chanel who conceived her famous blazer when she spied a bellboy on a holiday to Salzburg and the Alps? The full tweed coats and ski-slope knitwear here seemed to play on that era\u2019s Thirties tropes.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nOr had he just conjured up a mountain, and the kind of chocolate-box vista that has a global brand identity itself? The romantic Alpine landscape is beloved by clients in all sorts of different markets, and let\u2019s not forget the next Winter Olympics will take place in Beijing in 2022. Yes, Lagerfeld was a romantic. But, he was pragmatic, and a German. And also had an extraordinary business head.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nLagerfeld\u2019s last outing was a riddle with a set that offered all sorts of tantalising clues. It was emotional, without being nostalgic or sentimental. It was wintry, without being cold. Its most unlikely feature was the actress Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, who walked holding a single white flower. But that riddle was quite easily answered \u2014 she was signed last year to be an ambassador for the label.\n\nPen\u00e9lope Cruz on the Chanel catwalk \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nThe designer spent more than three decades building the myth of Coco Chanel, and in the process built a $10bn brand. He was a great designer, a brilliant subject and had a genius for branding \u2014 and storytelling. Now he\u2019s gone, Paris Fashion Week will never be the same.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nOn each seat there was a sketch by Lagerfeld of himself and Coco Chanel standing side by side. \u201cThe beat goes on \u2026\u201d read the inscription. And so it will. In recent days, Alain Wertheimer, chief executive of Chanel, has appointed Lagerfeld\u2019s head of studio, Virginie Viard, to be artistic director of the fashion collections while Eric Pfrunder will be artistic director of fashion image. Both have long been integral members of the Lagerfeld team. The Wertheimers want a smooth and dignified transition. The implication is that nothing here will change, the Chanel house will continue as it has done. And yet, to imagine future shows without Lagerfeld\u2019s theatrics seems inconceivable. One can only wonder for how long it might go on.\n\nIn the meantime, the brand is getting on with business, and those interlocking Cs sell on. As for all the fake snow? Today\u2019s fairytale will be tomorrow\u2019s garbage. Just as Lagerfeld would have wanted it to be.\n\nJo Ellison will be hosting the FT\u2019s Business of Luxury Summit in Madrid on May 19-21.

  "authors": [
    "Jo Ellison",
    "Fashion Shows",
    "Kering Sa",
    "Alexander Mcqueen"
  ],
  "text": "Having seen the departure of Stella McCartney, and since parting ways with Christopher Kane, the Kering group is currently focused on investing in those labels it thinks might ape the success of its power brands like Saint Laurent. Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, Kering\u2019s chairman, has made it clear he would like Alexander McQueen to be among those houses within his stable reporting more than \u20ac1bn in annual revenues. No easy feat; the brand is currently listed among several Kering fashion assets, including Balenciaga, and its revenues are estimated to be around a fifth of Saint Laurent\u2019s \u20ac1.7bn. That said, with enough investment, and the right creative momentum, it might be done. Saint Laurent was reporting revenues of only \u20ac400m in 2010.\n\nFor a long time after the premature death of the house\u2019s founder, in 2010, the brand was frozen in the image of Lee McQueen. Designer Sarah Burton has worked exhaustively in the interim to honour his legacy, and his vision, and quite brilliantly so. But with more recent collections you get the sense that she is ready to step forward with the business. And with the opening of a huge new London flagship store on Bond Street in January, and a confident chief executive, Emmanuel Gintzburger, who arrived in 2016, things are quickly moving on.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nNot so much creatively, thank goodness. The McQueen silhouette and style in which the brand was founded is still 100 per cent authentic, and Burton\u2019s AW19 collection was no different in that respect. But there seemed to be more focus on the balance in the offering. As the house that designed the Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s wedding dress, and was the star of an otherworldly exhibition at first the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and then the V&A in London, the public perception is that Alexander McQueen makes magical dresses. For the Kering brand to hit its targets, it needs to pivot attention back to daywear and, more crucially, its suits.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nThis collection opened with a clutch of just those items, all fabricated in heritage fabrics sourced from northern British mills. The McQueen suit is famous for its exaggerated English shoulder, and a very lean line. These suits, in charcoal grey, with drapey asymmetrical hems and feminine details, were more than fit for purpose, they were sublime. Knitwear, daywear, clothes to please the suits, the one thing lacking was a handbag or a key accessory to bank \u2014 Alexander McQueen has been living off its earnings on a platform sneaker and a skull-print scarf for far too long.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nAnd what for the fantasists among us? Surely there were magical moments here? Of course, no Alexander McQueen show under Burton would be without them, and it wasn\u2019t long before the sober suiting and knitted daywear took on a very different guise. Jacket sleeves started blooming, hems peeling and one suit metamorphosed into a rose (already the motif of the season elsewhere). Burton had gone on a tour of her home country to find her inspiration, and her narrative about the beauty of northern manufacture and our once proud woollen mills (now tragically dwindled, and perhaps more so after Brexit) was brought to life quite brilliantly here.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nA shirt dress was made in buttoned layers of crisp white cotton, but its construction contained the classic detail of a gentleman\u2019s shirt. Panels of houndstooth check, in scarlet, popped from overcoats, or were twirled into decorative rosettes. A silver dress was made from what seemed like millions of sequins, but was actually embroidered in tiny fragments of loom. The last looks were pure fantasy: a black tuxedo jacket with a black corsage at the hip before falling to the floor; and a huge red silk taffeta dress, using bolts and bolts of fabric, all pleated to look like a huge bouquet of buds. It climbed up around the neck and around the shoulders to sit fan-like, and ever so regal. In Burton\u2019s hymn to British manufacturing towns, like her own Macclesfield in Cheshire, here was a queen of the north.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nJo Ellison will be hosting the FT\u2019s Business of Luxury Summit in Madrid on May 19-21.

  "text": "Thank you for your help!\n\nWhat was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nUniversities award degrees for life, but in an era of rapid technology change and potential job displacement \u201cone education will no longer last a lifetime,\u201d says Sebastian Thrun, the co-founder of online education company, Udacity.\n\nThe Stanford University professor, who also founded X, Google\u2019s experimental technology lab, proposes a new model where skills are acquired throughout a person\u2019s career, rather than in one go at the start.\n\nHe believes online learning is an effective way for people already in employment to acquire specialist skills they did not learn at university. The majority of the 10m people who have registered for Udacity\u2019s courses have a degree, according to Mr Thrun.\n\nHe sees a \u201chuge vacuum of people who could massively benefit from education but who are currently excluded\u201d because they cannot quit their jobs to return to full-time study.\n\nMr Thrun is not alone in his thinking. Several online learning companies that specialise in short, targeted courses have emerged over the past few years.\n\nOne example is Udemy, an online learning platform where instructors can charge students to access their courses. Founded in 2010, Udemy today has 30m students, 42,000 instructors and courses in more than 50 languages.\n\nFor students, online courses can bring an array of benefits, including a career change, promotion, pay rise or further study at university.\n\nDuring 2018, James Cuggy, 47, took a number of online courses on topics including marketing and entrepreneurship. At the time, he had a full-time job in customer services at the UK insurer Prudential, alongside working as a sales and marketing consultant for a software start-up.\n\nFor many firms, training workers is mission critical as they can\u2019t find them on the job market\n\nMr Cuggy says the online courses taught him new skills \u2014 such as how to generate new leads through social media \u2014 that have made him much more valuable to the start-up. He paid for the courses, which cost \u00a330-\u00a350 each. But many companies are willing to pay for employees to develop their expertise and knowledge in new areas, according to Leah Belsky, vice-president of enterprise at digital learning platform Coursera.\n\nIn 2016 it launched Coursera for Business, which enables organisations to pay for employees to take courses provided by the world\u2019s top universities in subjects ranging from design thinking to negotiation.\n\nCoursera then shares revenues generated by clients including L\u2019Or\u00e9al, AXA and Pfizer, with the universities that created the courses.\n\nMs Belsky says the advantage for companies is attracting and retaining talent in areas prone to skills shortages. It also helps organisations that operate in economies with high levels of employment, such as the US, where competition for talent is fierce.\n\nCoursera\u2019s courses for businesses start at $400 a year for each learner. Ms Belsky says this expense compares favourably with the cost of replacing an employee, which can be significant. \u201cFor many firms, training workers is mission critical as they can\u2019t find them on the job market,\u201d says Ms Belsky.\n\nIn 2016, aerospace company Airbus started putting staff through \u201cnanodegrees\u201d on data science. These online courses are built by Udacity in collaboration with companies to develop job-specific abilities.\n\nYou learn new skills and ways of working, and create new networks of people from other business areas\n\nData science skills, which are in short supply, are essential to Airbus, for example, as it develops its digital services, says Veronika Eckstein, the company\u2019s head of corporate governance academy.\n\n\u201cThe trainees are . . . improving decision-making, and instantly applying what they learn in the workplace,\u201d says Ms Eckstein.\n\nSilvia Mouronte Arcones, 32, is among the Airbus employees to have completed the data science nanodegree. She says the course enabled her to move from a technical engineering role into data analytics.\n\nMs Mouronte Arcones, who already has a bachelors and a masters degree in engineering, studied for around 10 hours every week for six months.\n\n\u201cThe challenge of balancing work and study is huge, but so are the benefits,\u201d she says. \u201cYou learn new skills and ways of working, and create new networks of people from other business areas.\u201d\n\nUniversities also want to provide \u201clife-long learning\u201d to reflect longer working lives and more frequent career changes among their former students. The Haas School of Business at the University of California Berkeley offers its alumni free access to some degree programme modules and webinars, for example on product management.\n\nThe idea is to entice new applications for executive education using the short courses as a try-before-you-buy taster, says Kevin Wong, the school\u2019s associate director of digital strategy.\n\nThe pressure to adjust the model has been intensified by a reduced take-up of its full-time MBA, says Mr Wong. There was a 7.5 per cent drop in applications for its 2018 on-campus MBA.\n\nSpecialist online courses are not a substitute for a degree like an MBA, notes David Lefevre, director of the Edtech Lab at London\u2019s Imperial College Business School.\n\nThey can, however, help people to top up their skills as business changes and new trends, such as artificial intelligence, emerge. \u201cOnline learning fills that skills gap,\u201d he says."

  "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nWatching a hologram lecturer is an eerily realistic experience \u2014 the hologram can look you in the eye, point to you and answer your question.\n\nThe hologram might be saying the same thing as a talking head on a video screen, but it has a much stronger presence, notes David Lefevre, director of the Edtech Lab at Imperial College Business School.\n\nThe hologram works by projecting a live image of the lecturer on to a screen in front on the class. The lecturer, who must be presenting from one of the university\u2019s several studios located across the world, has a live audio feed and a screen that shows their class. This allows them to watch and listen to students, and interact with them.\n\nThe hologram lecturer changes students\u2019 responses, says Mr Lefevre. With video conferencing, students often look at their iPads or phones. \u201cBut they feel that the hologram lecturer is in the room interacting with them, and that they should pay more attention to it. The psychology is very important.\u201d\n\nHolograms are among a number of technologies that business schools are trialling to improve engagement among students who study online.\n\nThey look a bit like a combination of an iPad, a Segway and a witch\u2019s broomstick\n\nMIT Sloan School of Management in Massachusetts has experimented with robots operated remotely by students or lecturers working in different locations. Peter Hirst, senior associate dean of executive education, says: \u201cThey look a bit like a combination of an iPad, a Segway and a witch\u2019s broomstick.\u201d\n\nThe lecturer or student talks live on the iPad and controls the movement of the robot with a joystick. What makes them seem lifelike, says Mr Hirst, is the fact that they can move around the room, turn their screen \u201cheads\u201d and simulate sitting or standing.\n\nStudents rate the robot instructor experience 70 per cent as good as having someone there in person, according to Mr Hirst, whose team canvassed the views of students and lecturers who had used the technology.\n\nWhy students or lecturers choose to interact online is an important factor in how well robots are accepted, says Mr Hirst. \u201cIf a student can\u2019t travel because of mobility challenges . . . people are much more accepting than if someone is just too busy.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, students tend to be grateful that remote control robotics allow them to have access to a respected expert who might be unavailable in person, rather than a local substitute.\n\nTechnical problems can be disruptive, however. \u201cIt is frustrating that in 2019 at MIT you can still lose the connection, or the picture breaks up, or the sound drops out,\u201d says Mr Hirst. Network connections can be particularly patchy with iPad robots: as they move around, they are more prone to hitting dead spots. They have even been known to get \u201cstuck\u201d in lifts.\n\nCommunicating body language is another drawback, says Mr Hirst. At the moment, the person using the robot has to initiate all movements; they are encouraged to do this regularly so people know there is a human behind the machine. \u201cIt would be great if there was just button you could push that would tell the robot to keep shuffling around,\u201d Mr Hirst says.\n\nVideo conferencing also still has a role in online business education, as seen with the WOW Room, developed by IE Business School in Madrid, Spain. This allows lecturers to see up to 48 remote students on a bank of screens and teach them as they would in-person.\n\nThis is using the technology, not just to transfer information, but to make people care\n\nThe system detects the students\u2019 expressions and gauges their level of attention and participation. When the class is finished, lecturers are given a video of the session. Below the recording, there are graphs of students\u2019 attention-levels and emotions during the class: lecturers use these to reflect on and refine their performance.\n\nBut for Mr Lefevre, this misses a key element of the classroom. \u201cThe Achilles heel is that for the lecturer it is a very realistic experience but the students only see the lecturer, not each other.\u201d\n\nThe Edtech Lab also uses machine learning and data analytics to look for patterns and predict learning outcomes.\n\nThe team found, for example, that their students mostly learn in four ways: they do all their work as soon as possible; study at regular intervals; binge-learn everything in two weeks; or have sporadic but intensive study periods.\n\n\u201cWe then found that poor [weaker-performing] students were all sporadic, but strong students were almost equally distributed across all the types,\u201d says Mr Lefevre. The team could not discourage the sporadic approach, he says, but they could warn their recruits that it often results in poor performance.\n\nIn future, MBA students may wear VR headsets to learn important skills, such as managing conflict. Technology company PA Consulting is developing VR scenarios in which leaders resolve disputes between team members.\n\n\u201cWe use actors to make simulations feel as lifelike as possible,\u201d says Nick Shackleton-Jones, director of learning innovation at PA Consulting. \u201cThe advantage of using VR is that it recreates the emotional experience, rather than merely being an academic exercise.\n\n\u201cThis is using the technology, not just to transfer information, but to make people care, which creates a much more memorable learning experience.\u201d"

  "title": "Expat identities: powers of expression in a foreign tongue",
  "authors": [],
  "text": "By Elsa Court\n\nLiving in a foreign country raises all kinds of questions, both practical and emotional: how do you define yourself and how are you characterised by your adopted homeland? This series relates, in alternating parts, the experiences of a British woman in Hong Kong and a French woman in the UK.\n\nLivia Franchini is a writer and translator from Tuscany, and one of the inaugural writers-in-residence of the Connecting Emerging Literary Artists (CELA) project, funded by the EU, under which her work will be translated into six languages.\n\nThough we have both lived in London for more than 10 years and have gravitated to the same social circles because of our shared interest in contemporary literature, I first became aware of her work after she commented on an essay I had written about my experience of using English as a second language.\n\nShe could relate, as she put it in a tweet, to the feeling of loss I was describing for a native eloquence that could be only partially recaptured in a second tongue. Like me, she felt as if a portion of her personality could not be fully communicated.\n\nHer first novel, Shelf Life, which she wrote as part of her PhD in women\u2019s experimental writing at Goldsmiths, University of London, is due to be published in August. It is experimental in form and was written directly in her second language, English.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Italian,\u201d she tells me over coffee, \u201cnot an Italian writer.\u201d She says it would be a challenge for her to go back to writing in her first language, something she has not attempted since her teenage years.\n\nI am interested in what seems to be a contradiction here: that you can feel the loss of eloquence in a second tongue yet still prefer it to your native language as a professional writer. In my experience, writing in a second language can be both intimidating and creatively liberating; the very challenge of it can be a catalyst for inventiveness.\n\nIn spoken English, my limits in the language initially meant I listened a lot and that everything I said ended up being reflective and analytical. I carry a bit of that analytical frame of mind into my writing in English.\n\nFranchini has worked as a co-ordinator for the Goldsmiths Prize, which celebrates experimental fiction in English, since it launched in 2013. I ask if English gives her more freedom to experiment with the novel format as a creative writer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very glad to be a second-language writer,\u201d she says. \u201cItalian as a language can be very baroque; it supports a lot of subordinate clauses and tends to poetic metaphor.\u201d\n\nEnglish hardly tolerates such a complicated syntax and while Italian writers may be tempted to experiment with imagery-heavy, overwritten prose, Franchini has become more of a sentence minimalist in English, a change she attributes in part to her discovery of the American short-story writer Raymond Carver when she first moved to England.\n\n\u201cIt seemed almost impossible to me that a story could progress by such short, blunt sentences,\u201d she says. \u201cFor a number of years I think I \u2018tested\u2019 the English language, trying to write in as pared-back, elliptical a style as I could.\u201d By doing so she eventually developed the style in which she writes in English today, far from the academic flourishes favoured by her university professors.\n\nStill, writing \u2014 or, for that matter, reading \u2014 can take twice as long in a foreign language, and for this reason it is easier to doubt yourself. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m so anxious that I doubt the entire meaning of a sentence I [have written] and have to google it,\u201d says Franchini, who has translated works by the likes of science fiction writer James Tiptree Jr and poet Michael Donaghy, both American.\n\nI can imagine the historical imperialism of the English language would contribute to that general feeling for many people who, like Franchini and me, did not learn it from birth.\n\nOnce this linguistic insecurity is overcome, some non-native writers might prefer writing in English for professional and creative purposes because they can be more dispassionate than they would be in their own tongue.\n\nFranchini says when she was invited by CELA to read a selection of her English-language poems in Madrid last year, she was unsettled when she realised how vividly physical and intimate one of the poems sounded in the Spanish translation that was being projected on a screen during the event.\n\nLivia Franchini reads her poems in front of a screen showing the Spanish translation\n\nTranslation into a language more closely related to her mother tongue had revealed this dimension of the poem\u2019s imagery, and she wonders whether she would have written it so freely had she been aware of that dimension from the start.\n\nFranchini takes her coffee black \u2014 to me, perhaps the only thing that betrays her as Italian, because she sounds uncannily British. She takes this as a compliment but also knows the middle-class inflections of her British accent echo her initial desire to assimilate.\n\nToday, describing her experience of having lived \u201cstuck as a pendulum\u201d between two countries and two languages for the best part of her adult life, she reflects in an essay for PEN, the international association of writers, that writing might best be defined as \u201cthe use to which we put our homesickness\u201d.\n\nYou can read more articles from our Expat identities series here.\n\nIllustration: Tom Peake; Photographs: Robin Silas Christian"

  ],
  "text": "As at many shows, there were many flowers at Givenchy, but these were micro florals, inspired by the designs on a porcelain vase, and engineer printed on to pleated dresses. The dresses, with their high-neck collars and mid-calf ruffly hems, looked highly feminine but never girlish. They were as pretty as can be.\n\nLike Valentino\u2019s Pierpaolo Piccioli, Givenchy\u2019s creative director Clare Waight Keller has had a stellar year. With her careful tailoring and focus on more elevated daywear she has redefined the codes of brand Givenchy and, in dressing the Duchess of Sussex, she has snagged the most visible client in the world.\n\nGivenchy \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nIt was perhaps no coincidence that her \u201cWinter of Eden\u201d collection took its cue from the early Nineties, when a generation of young aristocratic models, such as Honor Fraser and Stella Tennant, started working in the business, bringing with them the bourgeois trappings of their ancestors and fusing them with the grungy flavours of the street. Having lost many of its esteemed and valued clients during the tenure of Riccardo Tisci, who gained a lot of younger customers with his more sporty point of view, Waight Keller\u2019s focus has been to reestablish the essential elegance at the core of Givenchy. She has worked on sharpening the tailoring (which is currently doing good business), and used the house\u2019s famed atelier to develop her couture-style silhouettes. \u201cIt\u2019s about clean modernity,\u201d she said of this collection. \u201cIt\u2019s less about sweatshirts, and more about the projection of a modern girl. I want to say that looking chic is beautiful, and then add some freshness in the mix.\u201d\n\nGivenchy \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nThis collection came in many shapes and sizes, from the clever new curved shoulder on the blazers, to the waisted coats with broad belt fastenings, the fluid florals and the huge pink debutante sleeves like something worn by Lady Di. Denim details poked out from under blouson capes and shirts, and the leather mini-skirt, sculpted sweater gowns and cropped blazers made for pleasant little sparks of surprise.\n\nGivenchy \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nIn past seasons Waight Keller\u2019s look has been more prescriptive; here were a dozen different styles. If you didn\u2019t think the micro-pleats would suit you, why not try a crystal strewn tuxedo suit for size? It had a lot of personality. And thankfully so. Waight Keller is a cautious, conscientious grafter, it was good to see her have fun and letting go.\n\nStella McCartney \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nIf Givenchy gave us Winter Eden, Stella McCartney provided looks to do the weeding in. Quilted multicolour dresses in vintage fabrics, a khaki boiler suit, such as a Land Girl might wear, Hunter wellies, claiming to be the \u201cmost sustainable rubber boots ever made\u201d, and an army-style green hoodie, the collection had base notes of Northern Soul and the whiff of compost chic. Although, McCartney herself described it all as \u201cconscious couture\u201d.\n\nStella McCartney \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nAlongside this upcycled, utility-based AW19 collection, McCartney was also launching a campaign, #thereshegrows, to persuade people to dedicate a tree to save the Leuser Ecosystem, an ancient forest on the island of Sumatra. But this was not the only effort to be more ecologically transparent: she had also sourced a sustainable viscose from a certified forest, and used organic cotton and eco-canvas, too. Not bad for a girl who staged her own little Brexit from the Kering group last year, and who must now fight for the planet as a force of nature on her own. She\u2019s clearly doing something quite impressive: she even got Oprah Winfrey to sit front row.\n\nStella McCartney \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nJo Ellison will be hosting the FT\u2019s Business of Luxury Summit in Madrid on May 19-21.

  "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nOxford v Cambridge is the oldest annual chess fixture, first played in 1873 and now hosted at the elegant RAC headquarters at Pall Mall, London. It is normally a tight match, and although Cambridge were heavily outrated this year they got close to victory before Oxford squeaked through 4.5-3.5 and so reduced their series deficit to 56-59.\n\nLong sequences are a feature of the match\u2019s history, Cambridge once winning 11 in a row immediately followed by Oxford with eight.\n\nIt was a special occasion due to the presence of Hou Yifan, the all-time No2 woman who is currently a Rhodes scholar at St Hilda\u2019s. No fireworks, though. Her Cambridge opponent Matthew Wadsworth played solidly for a comfortable draw with opposite coloured bishops\n\nThe match used to be a training ground for the England national team, but it has completely changed character to a global occasion with six nations represented and only half the players English. Departed also are the Oxford historians, as the subjects studied are now geared towards the practical: science and engineering five, mathematics and computer science five, economics three, the rest three.\n\n2305\n\nErnesto Rotunno v Alexander Alekhine, Montevideo 1938. The then world champion Alekhine was noted for his tactical coups, but Black (to play) has to be careful here due to White\u2019s c6 pawn.

  "title": "Collecting vintage theatre posters",
  "authors": [],
  "text": "Walking into Michael Diamond\u2019s West Hampstead apartment is like crossing the threshold into a parallel universe: one filled with shocking thrillers, horror shows and side-splitting comedies \u2013 for every wall is densely plastered with colourful theatrical posters. Train crashes are promised by one; dancing girls feature in another, alongside enticing advertisements for popular melodramas of the late-19th and early-20th centuries.\n\n\u201cThese posters are not necessarily representative of what you would see on stage \u2013 they were designed to draw in an audience,\u201d says Diamond, a former BBC World Service presenter and the UK\u2019s leading collector of theatrical posters. He has gathered together some 300 examples, all from the Victorian and Edwardian eras. \u201cThese plays were the light entertainment of the day and they reveal a great deal about the central concerns of the working population,\u201d he explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis favourites run from the highly artistic posters created by Dudley Hardy, such as The JP at the Strand Theatre, to the witty, deftly composed work of John Hassall (famous for his \u201cSkegness Is So Bracing\u201d railway advert). \u201cHe has a very good sense of humour,\u201d says Diamond, whose Hassall collection includes a 1907 poster for a Drury Lane production of Babes in the Wood that can be found at specialist King\u2019s Road dealership AntikBar, one of Diamond\u2019s sources, for \u00a3550.\n\nThe invention of colour lithography in 1851 made these vibrant, mass-produced posters possible, but it was not until later in the century that the medium was exploited to the full, chiefly by French artists such as Jules Ch\u00e9ret and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. The latter created his first poster in 1891 for a Moulin Rouge performance by the popular music-hall dancer La Goulue, an original example of which was recently offered by specialist-poster auction house Rennert\u2019s with an estimate of $300,000-$350,000.\n\nMeanwhile, Ch\u00e9ret\u2019s famous poster advertising the ground-breaking American dancer Lo\u00efe Fuller at the Folies Berg\u00e8re in 1893 is available on 1stdibs for $12,000. This is one of hundreds of theatrical posters being offered by Eric Trompier, a wine and restaurant consultant based in California. \u201cI started my collection over 30 years ago in Paris,\u201d he says. \u201cAn auctioneer friend held a poster sale and told me that some beautiful ones didn\u2019t sell, including a signed Ch\u00e9ret original of music-hall dancers. I instantly loved them and bought them all. Artists like Jules Ch\u00e9ret could capture the spirit and magic of a show.\u201d\n\nAnother prominent figure was the Czech artist Alphonse Mucha, who, in 1894, created a poster for Sarah Bernhardt. Although the printer was anxious about Mucha\u2019s unconventional design, Bernhardt loved it and gave the art nouveau trailblazer a six-year contract. His two-sheet poster for Bernhardt\u2019s 1898 production of Med\u00e9e sold for $23,750 in 2017 at New York\u2019s Swann Auction Galleries, which runs four vintage-poster sales a year \u2013 the next is on August 7.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while theatrical posters from 1890 to 1910 have traditionally been regarded as the high point of the genre, there has been a shift in collector interest, says Kirill Kalinin, founder of AntikBar and president of the International Vintage Posters Dealers\u2019 Association. \u201cModernist examples are particularly popular,\u201d he says, pointing out a 1925 Czech poster (\u00a31,250) by Alexandr Vladimir Hrska for the play Clovek v Kleci (Man in a Cage), or a 1923 Russian art deco image (\u00a31,250) for AM Fokin\u2019s Theatre of Miniatures.\n\nFor Nicholas Lowry, the president and principal auctioneer at Swann, the most coveted examples today are \u201c1920s and 1930s art deco French music hall\u201d, with his highest price to date fetched by a 1920s advert for a Paris show by the Black Birds, an all-black performance troupe from Harlem. The only known example to come to auction, the poster \u2013 by Paul Colin \u2013 sold in 2003 for $172,500. More recently, a rather gruesome 1930 poster by Colin for La Main de Singe (based on the WW Jacobs horror story The Monkey\u2019s Paw) at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Grand-Guignol in Pigalle was sold by Lowry for $4,420.\n\nJason Pellecchia, director of vintage-poster specialist Chisholm Larsson Gallery in New York, has noticed a hunger for posters of first-run musicals. \u201cThere is a lot of interest in large-format Broadway posters, with top-of-the-range examples fetching $1,000-$3,000,\u201d he says, citing one ($2,400) for rock musical Hair from 1968. He also has a 1981 poster ($2,400) for a triple bill entitled Parade at the Metropolitan Opera, which owes its fun, colourful design to David Hockney.\n\n\u201cWe tend to sell such posters to people looking for a pleasing image to adorn their wall rather than to collectors,\u201d says another specialist New York dealer, Mickey Ross, who has a beautiful Marc Chagall poster ($2,800) designed for the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s production of Mozart\u2019s Die Zauberfl\u00f6te in 1967, alongside a witty 1934 design ($1,100) by French artist Georges Dola for Le Comte de Luxembourg, a Franz Leh\u00e1r operetta. The appeal of such pieces needs little explanation, says Ross: \u201cAfter all, the whole point is that they are explicitly designed to catch the eye.\u201d\n\n442"

  "text": "\u201cTruth and roses have thorns about them\u201d, warned Henry David Thoreau, the essayist, poet, philosopher and naturalist wont to living in a wooden hut. Which may be true, but designers just love getting scratched.\n\nRoses represent all the dualities that fashion adores to speak of \u2014 fierceness and fragility, youth and decay, romance and repulsion \u2014 plus, you know, they look quite good on a frock. \u201cAfter women, flowers are the most divine creations,\u201d goes another quote, attributed to the late couturier Christian Dior. Which sounds like the kind of greasy charm you might lavish on a client. But as an enduring symbol of a general sense of loveliness, the rose motif serves fashion pretty well.\n\nPaco Rabanne \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nThis season has been particularly bountiful, and roses have flowered on all sorts of catwalks and in every kind of guise. At Prada, they hung in wilted silk corsages. Dries Van Noten plucked \u201cimperfect\u201d specimens from his garden, shot pictures of them and turned them into prints. At Paco Rabanne, Julien Dossena used a rose print to essay \u201cold-school Hollywood\u201d on a tight satin skirt with a Roxy Music-era train.\n\nDries Van Noten \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nAt the show entitled \u201cRose\u201d at Noir Kei Ninomiya, the flower made for glorious bouquets. Ninomiya, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the Japanese brand Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, and under whose umbrella he still shows, had used the flower both as dressing and adornment. Working with the floral artist Azuma Makoto, each of his 32 looks included a rose headpiece with flowers so fragrant they filled the catwalk with a lovely rosy fug. Later in the collection, the flower became an actual detail on the dresses or, rather, great pink rose-strewn cocoons. As a reminder to stop and smell them, it was really rather cute.\n\nNoir\n\nNoir\n\nNoir\n\nAt Valentino, roses were the centrepiece of a recurring print throughout designer Pierpaolo Piccioli\u2019s AW19 show. Designed to represent a montage of \u201cmodern romanticism\u201d, the print was developed by Jun Takahashi, of the streetwear label Undercover, with whom Piccioli now regularly works: the pair collaborated on their menswear shows at Pitti Uomo, and an Undercover print appeared in the Valentino pre-collection, too. Alongside the roses, the print featured a Renaissance sculpture of a couple kissing, a starry constellation and lines of love poetry. The poems had been commissioned by Valentino, and the contributors included Greta Bellamacina, Yrsa Daley-Ward, Robert Montgomery and Mustafa The Poet. Here\u2019s a fragment, by Daley-Ward: \u201cRoses are always armed; that should tell you something.\u201d\n\nValentino \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nWhat it told me was that this collection was a love bomb. And, with its sheer sorbet-coloured fairy dresses, goddess gowns and prints aplenty, it was about as subtle as a whack around the head. But hey, when in Rome (which is where Valentino is headquartered), it\u2019s easy to let emotions run amok. Besides, Piccioli must be feeling pretty loved up right now. He\u2019s enjoyed a near perfect year of critical acclaim, red-carpet glory (last week he whipped up another showstopper, for actress Brie Larson, in the perfect shade of Captain Marvel blue) and the general adoration of his fans. He picked up the prize for best designer at the Fashion Awards in December. That he was conveying a sense of \u201cmodern romanticism\u201d with this collection wasn\u2019t much of a surprise.\n\nValentino \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBut you can have too much of a good thing. So many roses, so much print and such an insistent theme made this courtship a little too intense at times. I craved the simpler seductions of his purer designs \u2014 such as the full-length gown in ivory, so plain it looked almost monastic, a stunning off-white trouser suit, a drapey damson dress in silk and wool cr\u00eape that looked a bit Grecian, another in crimson red. But these were parcelled out like little treats between the lover-print peacoats and appliqu\u00e9d capes.\n\nValentino \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nIt\u2019s possible Piccioli could be the victim of his own success. His signature style \u2014 swooning gowns in the couture manner \u2014 has been so tremendously successful that it\u2019s also been tremendously picked up. Rare has been the catwalk this season that hasn\u2019t featured at least one dress in a saturated colour, and in the same extravagant, voluminous style. This collection suggested that he feels some pressure to move on and offer something different. That he doesn\u2019t want to get stuck in the same creative trap.\n\nValentino \u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nThere will always be other gardeners out there, and some will cultivate the same variants of rose. But Piccioli can rest easy: few will ever smell as sweet.\n\nJo Ellison will be hosting the FT\u2019s Business of Luxury Summit in Madrid on May 19-21.

  "title": "Secret Misiones into another Argentina",
  "authors": [],
  "text": "Unexpected Argentina. On paper the words read a bit like sell copy \u2013 a tagline, proposed to a tourism board by a not especially imaginative copywriter. But it was nevertheless the two-word mantra on a persistent feedback loop in the back of my mind one week last autumn, as I traversed the length of the Argentine province of Misiones: improbably green, unaccountably wild and dense with singular intersections of culture and history that couldn\u2019t have less to do with tango, estancias or Malbec.\n\nMisiones, the country\u2019s second-smallest province, is Argentina\u2019s big anomaly, an inverted comma of land measuring some 30,000sq km, reaching up into the subtropical rainforests of southern Brazil, grazing the right flank of Paraguay as it goes. From the grasslands and timber farms of its southern reaches to the clicking, rustling, spectacularly alive rainforest that carpets its northern reaches up to Iguaz\u00fa Falls \u2013 where Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil converge \u2013 Misiones passed multiple times between the powers vying for primacy on the continent from the 17th to the 19th century, and as a consequence is suffused with the histories of all of them. But the heritage that arguably most defines it is South America\u2019s Jesuit one. Centuries before the borders between Portuguese- and Spanish-controlled territories here began to cohere into nations, Jesuit priests had set about converting the indigenous population \u2013 comprised almost exclusively of Guaran\u00ed peoples \u2013 and gathering it into mission villages. By the mid-1600s, a thriving network of reducciones, as the enormous missions they built are known, had been created, largely overseen by the Peruvian-born Jesuit Antonio Ruiz de Montoya (famously said to have personally baptised more than 100,000 Guaran\u00ed). With ornate cathedrals, vast residential complexes and advanced agriculture practices, the reducciones were home to as many as 7,000 people, and could span dozens of hectares \u2013 their orchards carved out of the rainforest, the spectacular baroque chapels and neat rows of workshops, residences and colleges fashioned from local sandstone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile a contemporary lens reflects the sometimes exploitative nature of the Jesuit mission (subjugation and coercion were among its intrinsic components), the societies were enlightened for their times. Ruiz de Montoya petitioned the court for the Guaran\u00eds\u2019 protection from slave traders; when in the late 1620s these grew too menacing in the north of his territory, he orchestrated a mass emigration southward, re-establishing some of the reducciones he\u2019d abandoned and creating new ones. Some Guaran\u00ed were taught Spanish; they also learnt masonry and ironworking, and how to raise livestock and other farming techniques that eventually saw them master the commercial cultivation of yerba mat\u00e9 (the bitter herbal brew that Argentines still drink). The missions thrived well into the 18th century until, their autonomy increasingly seen as a threat by both the Spanish court and the Church, the Jesuits were expelled from the Americas and the reducciones eventually abandoned.\n\nToday, the ruins of four of the largest reducciones are in Misiones, protected under the aegis of Unesco World Heritage, and they are incredibly atmospheric sites, rivalling Cambodia\u2019s Ta Prohm temple complex for the sheer spectacle of monumental architecture slowly being subsumed into jungle. But Misiones has long been Argentina\u2019s flyover country. Its capital of Posadas, in the south, is more often used to access the Iber\u00e1 wetlands in neighbouring Corrientes province than it is to explore Misiones itself, and Iguaz\u00fa has its own international airport, well connected to Buenos Aires and S\u00e3o Paulo. More intrepid visitors to the famous Falls might drive down to the northernmost reducciones for a day to walk around, or perhaps drive up from Posadas.\n\nBut Christopher Wilmot-Sitwell of UK boutique-travel designers Cazenove+Loyd, who had helped me sort a trip to Corrientes before a planned onward journey to Iguaz\u00fa, had a different proposition: drive across the province, south to north, experiencing it in human terms. \u201cHow can you get a true feel for Rajasthan, for instance, if you just fly from city to city and miss out entirely its rural heartland?\u201d he said. \u201cLikewise in Misiones \u2013 it\u2019s important to appreciate the change in the lie of the land, from the pancake-flat grasslands of Corrientes via the Jesuit missions to the much more forested and hilly Misiones. Besides the fact that it\u2019s a dramatic journey in its own right, you avoid seeing the same terrain in two directions, as most do by visiting the missions from Puerto Iguaz\u00fa.\u201d\n\nThat theory bore out well on the ground, in a comfortable Toyota 4Runner stocked with picnic food and drinks provided by Awasi Iguaz\u00fa, the exclusive new lodge at the falls that was my final destination. I was met by my Awasi guides just north of Posadas, from which it\u2019s a little over an hour to Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Loreto. In its heyday, the reduccione at Loreto was a nexus of intellectual pursuit, and said to have surpassed Buenos Aires in population. It was here the Jesuits established the first printing press in South America; having interpreted indigenous languages into the Roman alphabet, they translated and printed Bibles, liturgical texts and dictionaries into the Guaran\u00ed language.\n\nThe rows of colonnaded workshops and residences, the central temple, the college \u2013 all are a vast tumbledown game of giants\u2019 blocks now; enormous rectangles of rust\u2011hued sandstone, toppled by time and furred with electric-green moss, lie across a wide plain of tall grass in the centre of dense forest. Here and there, sections of wall still stand, clutched by the muscular roots of laurels and guadua trees. Remarkably intact hexagonal tiles mark a spot where perhaps Roman-style baths sat; Doric column bases, measuring almost a metre in diameter, sink into the soil. Amid the regrown forest, the footprint of the mission is still discernible \u2013 swathes of grass through sparser tree growth indicating a former road, or a ridge in the ground concealing the base of a hundreds-year-old wall. Native thrushes and shrikes dived and nattered, and the surrounding forest was thrumming with birdsong, but we saw only about five other people in the entire two hours we spent there.\n\nFurther up the road, past villages, timber farms and the occasional entrance to a regional park, we came to San Ignacio Min\u00ed. It\u2019s probably the most visited of the reducciones and certainly the most tourist-savvy; a small town has sprung up around it, and street vendors peddle gourd wind chimes and sacks of yerba mat\u00e9 along its perimeter. But it is still awe-inspiring, both in its scale and in the sheer splendour of its ruin. More structurally intact than Loreto, it stretches across acres of semi-cleared parkland; more than a dozen residential blocks, their roofs long since collapsed, march one after the other, carpeted in dead leaves, ferns sprouting where once stone lay flush on top of stone. Walls are split by trees engulfed in the fatal embrace of strangling vines. On the site of the main temple complex, majestic archways flanked by extravagantly carved columns soar skyward; bas-relief saints sport decidedly indigenous-looking costume (the Spanish baroque style of the period was embellished here to incorporate elements of Guaran\u00ed design and culture).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it was Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Santa Ana, the least visited of Misiones\u2019 reducciones, that made the most profound impression. Perhaps because my guide and I were the only people on the entire site; perhaps because it was late afternoon and the sun slanted at a deep angle between half-fallen walls and arches, laying its own architecture of light and shadow over the footprint of the vanquished ruin. But most likely because Santa Ana has another intriguing chapter to its story: in the early 20th century, Argentina lured waves of western Europeans across the Atlantic with generous land titles (one quickly acclimatises to the incongruity of towering blond blue-eyed locals in this native South American jungle). Those who arrived in Misiones found an almost unimaginably inhospitable landscape, teeming with deadly animals, insects and diseases. Many survived only a few years; some of these are buried in a small, long-abandoned cemetery on the site of Santa Ana, created just behind a temple-complex wall. It is one of the most melancholy places I have ever seen, half lost in thigh-high grasses and heavy with the spectres of truncated life stories, among them tiny children\u2019s. Tombstones, some bearing enamelled cameos or photographs of the deceased, list steeply or lay fallen, facing skyward, held fast to the ground by the tireless vines. Doors to mausoleums hang off their hinges; one of them sprouts an enormous native fig, an explosion of leaves erupting where the roof once was, the mouldy stone walls riven by jagged fissures. Though the cemetery is separated by three centuries of history from the ruins, the relentless progression of nature has rendered them equal \u2013 equally forsaken, equally moving.\n\nLong past dark on that day, after hours of traversing rolling jungle-covered hills, I\u2019m delivered to Iguaz\u00fa, and Awasi. The quality of the guides the lodge had dispatched to accompany me on my drive north was impressive, and the reputation of this micro-chain of lodges (the other two properties are in Chilean Patagonia and the Atacama Desert) had preceded it in all the best ways.\n\nAnd despite perilously high expectations, Awasi Iguaz\u00fa, which opened last February, hit every last mark. This is not as much to do with the pitch-perfect design of the lodge itself \u2013 though perfect, to my mind, it is, marrying the rusticity of rough limed wood with the refinement of plunge pools, ceramic-clad bathrooms, beautiful framed botanicals, huge netted king beds and indulgent allocations of personal space \u2013 as it does with Awasi\u2019s experiential focus. This seems, rather cleverly, to be about everything beyond the falls \u2013 which, after all, are eminently accessible (and to which, of course, Awasi guides can lead excellent, informative visits). The guides have established relationships in the various surrounding parks and reserves, some of them private, so as to provide their guests with exclusive excursions into the extraordinary Interior Alto Paran\u00e0 Atlantic forest that defines northern Misiones, home to thousands of endemic animals, birds, insects and flora found nowhere else.\n\nPonchos tied at our waists, thick leathers strapped round our ankles and calves (many of the snake species here are acutely venomous), we ventured out along new trail networks created by Awasi\u2019s guides. I knelt on my knees like a child on the bow of a speedboat at the base of a thundering waterfall, soaked by spray, watching dozens of great dusky swifts clinging to a single wet outcropping \u2013an incredible rippling mass of shining slate\u2011grey feathers and glinting white beaks. We held our bags above our heads and waded into thigh-deep water to ford a flooded trail, creepers trailing across our scalps and enormous azure butterflies, the jewel-toned jetsam of the rainforest, weaving aimlessly a few feet from our faces.\n\nAfter each excursion was the promise of excellent food at the lodge, a craft cocktail at the bar, a massage in your villa or a fascinating chat with any one of the dynamic young guides. But I discovered that solitude is the best conduit to what\u2019s irreproducible about Awasi, and about Misiones too: standing on the patio alone in the last of the daylight, the forest almost overwhelms with what was unseen heard and what was unheard imagined \u2013 toucan and ocelot, coati and capuchin monkey, perhaps even an elusive jaguar; the immensity of life here in this corner of Argentina, like the richness of its history, extraordinary and unexpected.\n\n443"

  "text": "Thank you for your help!\n\nWhat was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nIt was an explosion in Kabul\u2019s Green Zone that took Farhad Zmarai\u2019s attention away from the marketing module he was studying for his MBA.\n\nWhile many students struggle with concentration, few endure the extreme distractions Mr Zmarai faced. He balanced studying in war-torn Afghanistan with work, family, poor internet connection and no financial aid.\n\nMr Zmarai was working for the World Bank when he started his course in August 2016. While Afghan culture puts a premium on technical degrees like engineering, Mr Zmarai was working for international organisations and \u201csensed the value\u201d of an MBA.\n\nMr Zmarai, who graduated in 2018, is part of the first class to complete the iMBA, launched by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nThe qualification is part of a growing trend towards digital delivery of MBAs. While many schools have programmes that blend classroom and online approaches, with the course at Urbana-Champaign, all teaching and learning takes place online.\n\nStatistics from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) show that between 2013 and 2018 there was a 69 per cent increase in the number of business schools offering online MBAs accredited by the organisation, with growth particularly focused in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nJeffrey Brown, dean at Urbana-Champaign, says: \u201cIt\u2019s been incredibly challenging, but exciting, building a new venture in a 150-year-old big, lumbering, bureaucratic institution.\u201d\n\n70% US business schools that reported a decline in applications for their two-year programmes in 2018\n\nLike other US institutions, Urbana-Champaign faced growing competition in recruiting students for its full-time MBA. Figures for 2018, compiled by the Graduate Management Admissions Council (GMAC), showed 70 per cent of US schools reported a decline in applications for their two-year programmes.\n\nCiting Urbana-Champaign\u2019s historical commitment to accessible, affordable education, Mr Brown set the fee for the entire iMBA to $22,000. He also waived the traditional GMAC exam entry requirement for students who had significant work experience.\n\nBeing online-only allowed the university to recruit students from a much wider field. It could target far more potential students, including those who did not live near good-quality alternative universities, and those from around the globe like Mr Zmarai.\n\nMr Brown also deployed a \u201cstacking\u201d approach where students can take courses online for free, and then pay if they want credits to use towards qualifications, including full degrees.\n\nUrbana-Champaign teamed up with a digital learning platform, Coursera, to deliver its iMBA. It was keen to avoid its online course being seen as second-best to its campus offering.\n\nWhile some universities have treated online education as an afterthought \u2014 simply filming existing lectures or employing more junior teaching assistants for courses \u2014 Urbana-Champaign invested in production and talent. It hired broadcast cameramen to make the films, built virtual classrooms and tapped its top professors.\n\nThe most surprising thing was the iMBA gave me the opportunity to get to know people\n\nData helps the university respond to students\u2019 needs. The school provides supplementary materials or different approaches when the data shows, for example, that students watch content multiple times or struggle in tests.\n\nSo far, Urbana-Champaign\u2019s decision seems to have paid off, with strong growth in the number of students taking the iMBA over the past three years. Some 270 of the 293 students offered a place on the iMBA in 2016 accepted. In January 2019, the school admitted another 600 students on to its iMBA, and will run a second recruitment cycle in August.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exceeded our expectations in every way,\u201d says Mr Brown. \u201cIn student satisfaction, retention, graduation, faculty perceptions \u2014 and in the amount of work required to pull it off.\u201d\n\nMr Zmarai\u2019s experience at Urbana-Champaign exceeded expectations, too. He cites an earlier distance-learning MBA that he began, but then abandoned, with a British university. \u201cIt was not even comparable,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were no videos, no lectures. They just gave us a few textbooks and assigned a tutor who was not even a professor.\u201d\n\nMr Zmarai says he did not miss out on an important lure of campus-based study while on the iMBA \u2014 personal networking. \u201cThe most surprising thing was the iMBA gave me the opportunity to get to know people through our assignment groups,\u201d he says.\n\nThe deteriorating situation in Afghanistan pushed Mr Zmarai to move to the US after completing the course. He now works as a contractor with Facebook. For him, the benefits of virtual study are becoming real."

  "text": "Teamwork is a core element of learning on MBA courses. Now, a group of business schools is practising what they preach by collaborating to develop new ways to teach their flagship postgraduate degrees digitally.\n\nThe Future of Management Education (Fome) alliance is a group of business schools that is working together to develop online teaching tools for their most-prized online courses. The founding members include Imperial College Business School, ESMT Berlin, BI Norwegian Business School, the Lee Kong Chian School of Business, EDHEC Business School and Ivey Business School.\n\nA central aim of the collaboration, launched in 2018, is to challenge the perception of digital education as a lesser alternative to classroom programmes, says Nick Barniville, an associate dean at ESMT Berlin.\n\nThe move could also be seen as a defensive step, however. Education has yet to be \u201cdisrupted\u201d by big tech \u2014 the collective term for Google, Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Facebook. These organisations have quickly dominated the advertising, retail, entertainment and media industries.\n\nThe online education market has its big tech equivalents \u2014 Coursera, 2U and FutureLearn, for example. But these organisations have, so far, failed to create too much upheaval among the high-value online courses run by established institutions.\n\nThe differentiation you can provide from other schools on these platforms is moderate because all the functionality is the same\n\nThe schools in the alliance have used platform providers for their massive open online courses, or Moocs, according to David Lefevre, director of the Edtech Lab at Imperial College Business School. But the point of the alliance is to build online courses that are much higher quality and value without relying on a third party, he says.\n\nThis comes at a time when providers are starting to deliver high-end courses with well-established schools. In 2017, for example, HEC Paris used the Coursera platform to deliver its first international online degree in innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\nFar from challenging business schools\u2019 flagship programmes, Dil Sidhu, chief content officer at Coursera, says his organisation helps them scale up. \u201cOur global platform allows our partners to reach more learners than would ever be possible in a traditional bricks-and-mortar setting,\u201d he says.\n\nThis may not reassure some business schools, which also worry about branding. When schools use a third-party learning platform, they usually include branding from both organisations on the course. The fear is that the dominant tech platforms could become as well-known, or even more so, than the schools, among students in the market for top courses. Fome helps to guard against this: all the schools part-own the platform so they need to use only their own branding on courses.\n\nThis desire for control is evident in other areas. When business schools use a digital learning platform, their provider\u2019s technology determines how the learning material is presented. With Fome, the schools develop their own platform and have much more ownership of the learning experience.\n\nCost is another consideration. As the business schools jointly own the platform, they do not have to share revenue with another provider. These savings could be eaten up by the investment it takes to develop online learning environments, but Fome\u2019s institutions can offset some of these.\n\nWe are concerned [with] developing the pedagogy . . . then finding the technology\n\nWestern University\u2019s Ivey Business School in Canada was an early exponent of online education. But cost can be a problem, says acting dean Mark Vandenbosch.\n\n\u201cWe are a public university in Canada and we don\u2019t have the same finances to do this stuff as Harvard or Stanford,\u201d he adds. As a Fome partner, he explains, the school can save money on system development costs because it uses technology already developed by others in the alliance.\n\nThis also helps to give Ivey a competitive edge when it comes to attracting students. The school could have used an online degree platform for its courses, says Mr Vandenbosch, but it would have been difficult to set itself apart.\n\n\u201cThe differentiation you can provide from other schools on these platforms is going to be moderate because all the functionality is the same,\u201d he says.\n\nAnne Swanberg, dean of teaching and learning at BI Norwegian Business School, agrees. \u201cAll these learning platforms are doing is taking the old paradigm of a classroom with a traditional teacher and trying to make it better by adding this new electricity, called online communication,\u201d she says.\n\nShe adds that the business schools in Fome are taking a much broader approach to technology and learning. \u201cWe are concerned [with] developing the pedagogy, finding new methods of teaching first, then finding the technology,\u201d she says.\n\nDan LeClair, chief executive of the Global Business School Network, believes business schools will co-operate more, but not just because of the challenge from third-party platforms. \u201cTechnology is enabling them to create more value [for students],\u201d he says. The beauty of the Fome alliance is that the member schools can protect their high-value online products while making the most of what technology has to offer."

  "text": "Thank you for your help!\n\nWhat was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nMuch of the early enthusiasm for massive open online courses, or Moocs, focused on how they could disrupt and democratise education \u2014 opening elite universities\u2019 courses to the masses. They have long faced one stumbling block, however: barely anyone who starts a Mooc completes it.\n\nA recent study by academics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that online courses had an astronomical dropout rate of about 96 per cent on average over five years. The research, which studied people who both registered and viewed a course by MIT and Harvard on their joint online learning platform, edX, also found that this figure had not improved between 2013-14 and 2017-18.\n\nGiven such alarming completion rates, have Moocs flopped?\n\nAnne Trumbore, senior director of Wharton Online, part of the University of Pennsylvania, says completion rates are the wrong measure of success. She says many people register or start online courses because they are curious and never intend to stick it out.\n\nNina Huntemann, senior director of academics and research at edX, says a better indicator of success is whether students who actually begin a course engage with it to a high degree.\n\nLearning is improved when students apply the theoretical concepts to practical scenarios\n\nShe also argues that students can acquire knowledge and skills without formally finishing a course. \u201cWe don\u2019t see completion rates being a goal,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople poke around to find parts of courses that help them, not necessarily every module.\u201d\n\nEdX tracks how frequently students watch videos and submit assignments. It uses the data to \u201cnudge\u201d them into finishing modules by sending updates and reminders to complete tasks.\n\nEngagement is 30 per cent higher when students have been nudged, according to Ms Huntemann. \u201cIf they struggle on a course section it might be because the material is not worded clearly enough, or videos are too long,\u201d she says. \u201cOur university partners use that data to produce course iterations.\u201d\n\nAnother strategy is adding interactivity to online courses. Spain\u2019s IE Business School helps students learn about setting a pricing strategy using simulation. Students set the rates of an airline and receive feedback on the impact their decisions have on the bottom line.\n\nMartin Rodr\u00edguez Jugo is a director at IE Publishing, an organisation that develops and distributes IE Business School\u2019s learning material. He says the 12-15 per cent completion rates for IE Moocs is due to this interactivity. \u201cLearning is improved when students apply the theoretical concepts to practical scenarios,\u201d he says.\n\nWe want to make online learning less of a solitary experience\n\nFutureLearn, an online course provider owned by the Open University, has focused on peer learning to support completion rates. Students discuss what they have learnt and share knowledge on the company\u2019s social network.\n\nThat addresses a common challenge with online learning: the connection with other participants and instructors. \u201cWe want to make online learning less of a solitary experience,\u201d says Simon Nelson, FutureLearn\u2019s chief executive, noting that the platform\u2019s completion rates among students who start courses is about 20 per cent.\n\nAnother trend is charging for courses that include tutoring or a certificate of completion. Rice University\u2019s Jones Graduate School of Business and 2U, an education technology company, are developing a portfolio of short, online courses for business executives.\n\nThe first course, on real estate development and investment, will be launched in June 2019 and will cost $2,800. Because the course is not free, Michael Koenig, the school\u2019s associate dean for innovation initiatives, expects completion rates to be around nine in 10. \u201cWhen people put skin in the game, they are more dedicated.\u201d\n\nCritics say paid-for courses reduce access to education and are at odds with the philanthropic and egalitarian ethos of the first Moocs.\n\nMr Koenig\u2019s response is that high-quality courses require investment in terms of money and faculty time. \u201cWe are trying to figure out how to provide education that is sustainable for the learner and the university,\u201d he says.\n\nRice\u2019s expected completion rates also reflect how people are using online learning to advance their careers \u2014 graduates will receive a Rice Business Executive Education certificate, which they can put on their CV.\n\nResearch suggests this can help students who are looking to get ahead in their careers. Nearly three-quarters of 600 employers polled by FutureLearn said evidence of online courses would help them make a decision about whether to promote an employee.\n\nOnline courses can also lead on to a full degree. Emily Parana, 41, a university teacher, enrolled in a cyber security \u201cMicroMasters\u201d on edX. The online access gave Ms Parana a way to study something that she would not have enjoyed otherwise: there were no suitable on-campus courses within a reasonable distance of her Pennsylvania home.\n\nThere was a second benefit for Ms Parana. Her online course helped her gain admission to a digital masters degree in computing security by providing academic credit towards it.\n\nMoocs may be becoming less massive and less open. But their potential for students remains big."

  "title": "Five reasons to live in Geneva, Switzerland",
  "authors": [],
  "text": "By Simon Brandon\n\nGeneva might not be a particularly large city by area or population, but when it comes to financial services it is certainly big. According to the Swiss government, Geneva\u2019s financial sector includes 140 banks and employs 35,000 people \u2014 not bad for a city of 200,000 people spread over 16 sq km. It is not all about work, however \u2014 the postcard-pretty financial hub is ringed by mountains that are perfect for summer hiking and winter skiing.\n\nQuality of life\n\nGeneva ranks among the top 10 cities worldwide for quality of living, according to Mercer\u2019s annual survey. Salaries are high and foreign professionals do particularly well: expats in Geneva earn an average of $184,942, according to data released last year from HSBC\u2019s Expat Explorer survey. This is the fifth-highest of cities surveyed, and well above the global average of $99,903.\n\nHigh-earning expats are well catered for by Geneva\u2019s shops\n\nMusical highs\n\nGeneva has something to offer music fans of every stripe. The city boasts one of the world\u2019s great opera houses, the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Gen\u00e8ve, while each summer the city centre and its parks are taken over by the F\u00eate de la Musique in which performers give free live concerts in every genre from classical to techno on more than 30 stages. The world-famous Montreux Jazz Festival takes place around early July every year at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, an hour by train from Geneva.\n\nThe globally renowned Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Gen\u00e8ve opera house\n\nEmployment rights\n\nSwitzerland is very generous to those who lose their jobs. Workers who are resident in the country and have been in their job for at least a year are entitled to benefit payments of 80 per cent of their salary for up to two years while they look for something new. This is capped at SFr148,200 ($147,500) a year.\n\nSloping off\n\nThe snow-covered summit of Mont Blanc, visible from Geneva all year round, is a constant reminder of the wealth of Alpine skiing available within a short drive of the city. The largest, most famous resort is Chamonix-Mont-Blanc, an hour-and-a-half away by car, which includes 10 ski areas on either side of the Chamonix valley. For somewhere smaller and more family-friendly, Praz de Lys-Sommand is less than an hour\u2019s drive from the city.\n\nMont Blanc is within an hour and a half\u2019s drive of Geneva\n\nTaking a dip\n\nThe city cradles the south-western tip of Lake Geneva, one of the largest freshwater lakes in Europe and the focus of much leisure activity. A 200km cycle route \u2014 mostly flat, despite the mountains on all sides \u2014 hugs the lake\u2019s perimeter, while the clean, glacier-fed water is perfect for a cool-down swim (though this is not recommended before June). Hiring a small motorboat costs about SFr140 for half a day from Les Corsaires on Quai Gustav-Ador.\n\nLake Geneva is a popular place for boating\n\nPhotographs: Getty Images; Roman Babakin; Lena Serditova; Getty Images/iStockphoto"

  "text": "Thank you for your help!\n\nWhat was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nOnline education is a fast-evolving market: the past few years have seen several business schools create purely online MBAs.\n\nSo it is surprising that little has changed at the top of the FT\u2019s online education ranking for 2019.\n\nWarwick Business School retains the number one slot this year for the best online MBA, partly on the strength of its faculty, but also its value for money and its graduates\u2019 career progression.\n\nThe growth in online education is reflected in the rankings with the arrival of the MBA@UNC programme, created by the University of North Carolina\u2019s Kenan-Flagler Business School, at number five on the list. This course started as recently as July 2011 and has risen quickly through the ranks.\n\nThe key factors that decide the top 10 online MBAs are the career progress of alumni, the diversity of the cohort and the quality of online delivery. The two main criteria for career progress, as for the FT\u2019s global MBA ranking, are alumni salaries three years after graduation and the percentage rise in salary.\n\nAverage salaries for the top online courses are comparable to those on the FT\u2019s ranking of full-time, campus MBAs. The average salary across all online courses on this list is $148,742. This is not far off the $189,975 average for the top 10 full-time MBAs in the 2019 global ranking.\n\nWarwick Business School\u2019s alumni salary for their online MBA is particularly strong. Its online graduates earn $214,141 on average, compared with $118,406 for its full-time MBA ranking. This is partly due to the school\u2019s strong reputation, but also because students on its online course tend to be older, have enjoyed more career progression and earn more than their full-time peers.\n\nThere is a difference in the way the percentage increase in salary is calculated. For online MBAs, we use alumni salaries on graduation as the base, as opposed to full-time MBAs, for which the pre-MBA salary is the base. Despite this, we can draw some interesting comparisons.\n\nThe big difference between online and full-time study is the salary increase. The average rise across the online courses is 32.1 per cent, compared with 119.5 per cent for the top 10 full-time MBAs in the 2019 global ranking.\n\nThis is due to student demographics. Full-time MBA students tend to be in their late 20s and at a point in their career where they enjoy rapid promotion. There is much more scope for them to increase their earnings after their MBA. Online MBA students, on the other hand, are more likely to be in their mid-30s and to switch careers after graduating. This means their salary is more likely to plateau \u2014 or even decrease \u2014 after the course.\n\nThe ranking also highlights a common misunderstanding about online MBA courses. Many people think that they attract more international students compared with full-time courses because they can be studied anywhere.\n\nThe data suggests this is incorrect. The average percentage of overseas students at the five US schools in this year\u2019s online MBA list is just 6.8 per cent. This contrasts to an average of 42.7 per cent for the seven US schools in the top 10 of the full-time MBA ranking. This suggests that in-person networking remains key for full-time MBA students.\n\nKey to the table Weighting percentages shown in brackets.\n\nFor the three gender-related criteria, schools that have 50:50 (male: female) composition receive the highest score. Salary today US$ (20): average alumni salary three years after graduation, $ PPP equivalent (see methodology).\u2020 Salary increase (10): percentage increase in alumni salary in the current job versus three years ago on graduation. \u2020 Value for money (3): calculated according to alumni\u2019s salary, fees and other costs.\u2020 Career progress (4): progression in the alumni\u2019s seniority and the size of company they now work for, versus three years ago on graduation.\u2020 Aims achieved (4): the extent to which alumni fulfilled their goals for taking an online MBA.\u2020 Careers service (4): the effectiveness of the school\u2019s careers service in terms of career counselling, personal development, networking events and recruitment, as rated by the school\u2019s alumni.\u2020 Programme delivery (5): how alumni rate the online delivery of live teaching, other teaching materials and online exams.\u2020 Online interaction (10): how alumni rate the interaction between students, teamwork and the availability of faculty.\u2020 Female faculty (3): percentage of female members of faculty. Female students (3): percentage of female students on the MBA programme. Women on board (1): percentage of female members on the school\u2019s advisory board. International faculty (4): percentage of faculty whose citizenship differs from their country of employment. International students (4): percentage of current students whose citizenship differs from the country the school is located in. International board (2): percentage of the board whose citizenship differs from the country in which the business school is situated. International mobility (5): based on alumni citizenship and the countries where they worked before their MBA, on graduation and three years after graduation.\u2020 Faculty with doctorates (5): percentage of full-time faculty with a doctoral degree. Corporate social responsibility (3): proportion of credits from core courses dedicated to CSR, ethics, social and environmental issues. FT research rank (10): calculated according to number of articles published by a school\u2019s current, full-time faculty members in 50 academic and practitioner journals between January 2016 and December 2018. Rank combines absolute number of publications, with the number weighted relative to the faculty\u2019s size. \u2020 Includes data for the class of 2015 and one or two preceding classes where available."

  "text": "Thank you for your help!\n\nWhat was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nNew York University\u2019s Stern School of Business announced a radical new departure in its postgraduate teaching this year: its masters in management (MiM) degree was its first to be totally online.\n\n\u201cWe are targeting a whole new market,\u201d says Kim Corfman, Stern\u2019s vice dean for MBA programmes and online learning. The aim, she adds, is to attract new student groups from outside the US, where MiM degrees are often more popular than the business school\u2019s core MBA programme.\n\nStern is entering an increasingly crowded market, however: the online masters degree is coming of age.\n\nWhile NYU Stern was unveiling its first purely digital degree, across the Atlantic in France, the first cohort of students were graduating from an online-only masters in innovation and entrepreneurship at HEC Paris.\n\nAmong the graduates was Efthymia Lioliou, a 44-year-old Greek-born, Paris-based biochemist. For Ms Lioliou, the 100 per cent online course was a way of fitting learning around raising two young children.\n\n\u201cIf I was younger I might have done this by studying on campus,\u201d she admits. \u201cAs it was, I could log on when my eldest daughter was at school and then work late at night when the children had gone to bed.\u201d\n\nThe risk for schools is that they become production studios for online courses\n\nThe course shows that students are not necessarily coming from further afield, but rather they appreciate the flexibility of online study, says Marc Vanhuele, professor of marketing, who teaches on the course at HEC.\n\n\u201cWe are targeting active professionals,\u201d he says, noting that the innovation and entrepreneurship course has regular deadlines to keep students on track, but enough slack to allow them to learn at a pace that suits them.\n\nAt \u20ac20,000, the tuition fees for the online masters degree are considerably less than the \u20ac69,500 HEC charges for its full-time MBA programme. The school makes up for this, however, by running much larger classes than the 65 people in the annual intake for the campus-based MBA.\n\n\u201cThe idea was to create something that is scalable,\u201d says Mr Vanhuele. His hope is to increase the online masters intake to a couple of hundred students a year, split between two cohorts.\n\nDespite the decision by top tier business schools like HEC and NYU Stern to offer full degree programmes online this year, the evolution of digital education is still in its infancy.\n\nVal\u00e9rie Claude-Gaudillat, a professor of strategy and director of the Institute for Innovation, Design and Entrepreneurship at Audencia, a business school in France, has experienced the limitations of technology first-hand.\n\nShe had a robot in her management class for a joint masters degree course with engineering and architecture. The experiment was \u201cdisappointing\u201d, Ms Claude-Gaudillat admits.\n\nThe example shows that classroom communication using technology is not yet as seamless as human interaction. \u201cIt was meant to interact with students, but its responses had to be pre-recorded, so it had lots of limitations in what it could do.\u201d\n\nWhen the course finished, the android educator was ditched. \u201cWhen I asked students afterwards what they most liked about the course, they said the group experience,\u201d Ms Claude-Gaudillat explains.\n\nShe suggests that online education is passing through the kind of \u201chype cycle\u201d that technology consultancy Gartner created to explain the evolutions of digital breakthroughs.\n\nThe cycle starts with an \u201cinnovation trigger\u201d and rises quickly to a peak of \u201cinflated expectations\u201d. It then drops into the \u201ctrough of disillusionment\u201d, before recovering through a \u201cslope of enlightenment\u201d to the final phase \u2014 the \u201cplateau of productivity\u201d.\n\nOnline education is just beginning to travel up the slope of enlightenment, according to Ms Claude-Gaudillat.\n\n30% Students at ESCP Europe who will learn at least partially online by 2022\n\nFrank Bournois is dean of ESCP Europe business school, which celebrates the 200th anniversary of its founding in Paris this year. Despite claiming to be the world\u2019s oldest business school, ESCP wants to remain a modern education institution. For some courses it blends classroom teaching with online learning using the Coursera platform, Mr Bournois notes.\n\nHe advises business schools to focus on making the teaching content as good as possible, rather than trying to become a technology supplier in their own right. \u201cThe risk for schools is that they become production studios for online courses,\u201d he says. Costs can escalate if schools take this route because they need to maintain their kit.\n\n\u201cOf course, our professors need to think a lot about what their students should see [in online courses],\u201d he adds. \u201cBut that does not mean that the school needs to employ people to make the videos.\u201d\n\nHe predicts that about 30 per cent of ESCP\u2019s students will learn at least partly online by 2022. At the moment, 27 per cent of students are taught either wholly or partially online. Over the same timeframe, he expects class sizes on campus to increase so that in-person teaching becomes more efficient. He predicts numbers will rise from the 25 to 40 people at present to about 100.\n\nEven as online learning evolves, he says, classroom teaching will always have a place in business education."

  "text": "The Balenciaga set was a vast black box that stank of asphalt. The collection reeked of street. It was brilliant, bold and contemporary \u2014 and there wasn\u2019t a sneaker to be seen.\n\nIn a season that has been big on retro references and the allure of the bourgeoisie, Demna Gvasalia\u2019s modern take on Paris style made for a powerful statement. There was lots of sober suiting, casual outerwear and simple evening dresses, but the cuts and the couture sensibility ensured no two looks (and there were more than 100 of them) were quite the same. It was also a meditation on what is relevant in fashion, a world where the water bottle has been elevated to new luxury status, and the synthetic puffa is more valuable \u2014 and desirable \u2014 than a fur. At Balenciaga, models slung bottle bags around their bodies, and carried bags that could manage a supermarket run. \u201cI like people who like shopping,\u201d deadpanned Gvasalia of his shoppers. \u201cI depend on people shopping for my job.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nGvasalia\u2019s show dripped with clever details, while offering new takes on the basics and tailoring tricks that made you stop and stare. The shoulder, already the feature of AW19, was pinched, volumised and pinned from behind. My favourite look of the season so far? An otherwise boring sweater with a suspended band that hovered implausibly above the collar. Worn with a pair of charcoal trousers and a red polka dot tote, it hit that G-spot where function meets true fashion and makes four weeks of shows feel more worthwhile.\n\nIt was grown-up, it was polished, it was full of couture details. Balenciaga was born a couture house after all and Gvasalia doesn\u2019t shy away from that \u2014 he just keeps his cuts for the things that are important \u2014 the suiting, the parkas and those endless, epic coats.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nOn its own the collection was stunning, if fractionally too long and hard to see. It also provoked all sorts of thoughts about \u201cnew luxury\u201d, and the new vogue for the bourgeois that has dictated the season\u2019s mood so far. In many ways Balenciaga\u2019s themes echoed the message of the season, where mature, slightly retro clothes have featured everywhere, from Gucci and Burberry, to Celine and Dolce & Gabbana, and designers have seemed less focused on the youth. I\u2019m not sure a single designer this month has mentioned \u201cthe millennial\u201d as a muse.\n\nAnd there\u2019s been less logomania. In recent seasons, luxury houses (and especially Balenciaga) have branded themselves like sportswear giants, such as Adidas or Nike. For AW19 things have been more subtle: there\u2019s been more focus on the clothes making than the brand name, and while there were still lots of logos at Balenciaga, they were slightly less brash and in your face. On the handbags, where a letter B was used as hardware, the branding was often blackened out.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nOne hopes it reflects a changing market in which consumers are less interested in buying exorbitantly priced T-shirts and more interested in the quality of the clothes. In the era of the \u201cAmazon puffa\u201d, and at a time where consumers are increasingly focused on value, the emphasis on more \u201cluxurious\u201d clothing might read as an act of self-defence. After all, if you want someone to spend \u00a33,000 on a coat, it should at least look, and feel, smart.\n\nIt might explain also the rise of that Seventies \u201cbourgeois\u201d mood \u2014 where loafers, equestrian details and headscarves have been key. It\u2019s more sophisticated surely, but you have to wonder how the modern woman will feel about this \u201clady\u201d sensibility. When I asked Derek Blasberg, the head of fashion and beauty partnerships at YouTube, to describe the style of Silicon Valley at the moment, he answered \u201cyoga\u201d. It\u2019s hard to imagine the wellness empresses of California finishing their spin class and putting on a box-pleat skirt.\n\nNeither would I have wanted to be flaunting a Thatcher-era pussy-bow blouse on Avenue Montaigne this weekend, where the gilets jaunes were out in force, as they have now been for months. Stuck on luxury\u2019s most bougie boulevard on Saturday as huge swaths of demonstrators surrounded the car, my instinct was simply to blend in. Fashion has an almost Marie Antoinette-ish capacity for denial and escaping into fantasy when real life gets too strong. Balenciaga was one of the few brands that seemed grounded in reality. Or at least some awareness of the world around it. The coats were couture style but they came in hazard yellow.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nIs fashion\u2019s preoccupation with the signifiers of the propertied classes a rallying call for custom, or a last-ditch cry for help? At Herm\u00e8s, arguably the brand to which the bourgeois woman most aspires, I asked designer Nad\u00e8ge Vanhee-Cybulski. The heritage brand has been quietly furnishing the world\u2019s wealthiest people for decades, and the padded quilted nappa leather puffas, cashmere coats and printed silk day dresses (inspired by a scarf print) she presented for AW19 were no exception.\n\nAnd yet she argues that the longevity and power of Herm\u00e8s is found in its being a \u201cdemocratic brand\u201d. The house of the astronomically expensive Birkin handbag is democratic? Come off it. \u201cFor me, Herm\u00e8s is about craftsmanship, and humanity. I\u2019m never thinking about transmitting a woman\u2019s status in society,\u201d she continued, \u201cbut on the men, and women, who are the experts in the house. I\u2019m purely focused on the skills of the atelier. The craftwork, and the detail. It\u2019s democratic, because everyone can see the beauty in the work.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nCarefully modest, craft-focused and cautious with its marketing, it\u2019s ironic that Herm\u00e8s is one of the most powerful brands. Its annual revenues amount to more than \u20ac5bn, but if you want an anecdotal indicator as to just how well it\u2019s doing, have a wander around any Herm\u00e8s store. Wherever you are in the world, along with Chanel, Gucci and Louis Vuitton, it\u2019s always, always the busiest one.\n\nThat said, and as with many of Vanhee-Cybulski\u2019s collections, I could live with a little less of the house\u2019s expertise. Did those lovely scarf-print blouses really need a pleated trim along the placket, or the ruffle running from the shoulder down the sleeve? Is there a massive demand for tailored leather knickerbockers? And does she always have to show such heavy shoes? I quibble. There were many delicious things here. Such as the black leather caban jacket, with overstitching, and a moss green cashmere coat with leather trims. Quietly stylish, epically expensive and essentially bourgeois. Clothes for people who care more about the quality, and have no interest at all in sticking out.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nJo Ellison will be hosting the FT\u2019s Business of Luxury Summit in Madrid on May 19-21.

  "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\n\u201cAnd I was like, \u2018An MBA? But that\u2019s not for doctors!\u2019 And he said, \u2018Precisely\u2019.\u201d\n\nPelayo de Merlo, 39, recalls the night five years ago, when his husband-to-be startled him out of complacency. While working as an anaesthesiologist, Mr De Merlo enrolled on an online MBA with IE Business School in Spain. Three years after graduation, he became the managing director of Quir\u00f2nsalud Hospital, Madrid.\n\nMr De Merlo\u2019s medical career was thriving, but he felt that something was amiss. \u201cI didn\u2019t see much progression from that point,\u201d he says. \u201cI had reached a ceiling and I wanted new challenges.\u201d\n\nOne evening, after the prompt from his fianc\u00e9, Mr De Merlo searched for MBA courses on the internet. Buoyed by the prospectus of IE Business School, he called a relative who had moved from being a practising physician to a role in healthcare administration.\n\nWe live in a digital world and we have to take advantage of not having these physical barriers\n\nHer advice was to take courses and diplomas intended for medical professionals, rather than the MBA approach he was considering. \u201cThe things that she was telling me about these medical degrees that she had done were nothing like the things that I had already seen an MBA could provide you with,\u201d says Mr De Merlo. \u201cI wanted to be with people who were not doctors.\u201d\n\nAlthough IE Business School is located in Madrid, where Mr De Merlo was living, the online course suited his situation much better than full-time campus study. He was able to complete the degree and continue with his career.\n\nBut while the online course offered more flexibility than full-time study, it was no more forgiving. Mr De Merlo, who started the course in 2014, found balancing the workload of a physician \u2014 including being on call and shift work \u2014 with study to be challenging. \u201cDuring the week I would study for six hours, and at the weekends 12 hours.\u201d\n\nThe hard work paid off, however, and Mr De Merlo graduated 18 months later. Today, he holds a dual role at Quir\u00f2nsalud Hospital. As medical director, he is responsible for all the clinical work in the hospital and, as managing director, he looks after everything from finance and operations to managing security and laundry.\n\nMr De Merlo is adamant he would not have considered an alternative to online learning. \u201cWe live in a digital world and we have to take advantage of not having these physical barriers,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf I went to a local school in Madrid, New York or London, I would be obliged to share all this knowledge [only] with the people that were physically there.\u201d\n\n* Madrid\u2019s IE Business School is a partner with the Financial Times in a corporate learning alliance."

  "authors": [
    "Alexander Fury",
    "Fashion Shows",
    "Celine Sa"
  ],
  "text": "Hedi Slimane enjoys starting his Celine shows with pyrotechnics worthy of rock concerts, against a soundtrack of resolutely un-Shazam-able origins. On Friday night, out back of Les Invalides, the music of the newer-than-new band Embrasse Moi, composed especially for the show, belted out as a panorama of bevelled mirror slowly lowered to the floor, a female figure poised, motionless, in the middle.\n\nCeline \u00a9Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nIt was a hell of an entrance. The really remarkable thing, however, were the clothes she was wearing: and it takes a lot to overshadow a woman lowered to earth in a gravity-defying vitrine. Slimane sent out his Celine woman dressed in pleated culottes, a sharp-shoulder blazer, a deftly knotted silk scarf, knee-high boots. In short, Slimane had changed the record. It was invigorating, energising, engaging \u2014 and, possibly, the best show of his career to date.\n\nThe looks were akin to Celine past \u2014 not recent but, rather, Seventies Celine, when the label was known for dressing French women with a horsey, thoroughbred respectability, and its boutiques first propagated worldwide. Flick through an old issue of French Vogue or L\u2019Officiel and you\u2019ll see Celine women in tweeds and cashmere sweaters and pussy-bow silk blouses printed with chains. The Celine monogram originated then \u2014 an entwined pair of Cs based on links in the chain fence that circles the Arc de Triomphe. Slimane has used it on a bag. That Arc borders on the 16th arrondissement of Paris, whose tony enclaves were the stomping-ground of that original Celine woman \u2014 while her counterpart in London spent her time ranging around Sloane Square. In short, she\u2019s bourgeois.\n\nCeline \u00a9Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nCeline \u00a9Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nCeline \u00a9Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nThe compelling thing \u2014 always \u2014 about Slimane\u2019s vision is its absolute precision. Volte-face or not, this Celine look was utterly convincing. It was also, perhaps, not as far from his past as it may seem. Maybe Slimane\u2019s first Celine collection in September was actually, somehow, an ending rather than a new start, rounding off the aesthetic he established during his Saint Laurent tenure, of Danceteria party dresses executed with a couture flair. That collection, entering stores worldwide right about now, was titled \u201cParis La Nuit\u201d. Couldn\u2019t this just be the daytime wardrobe of the same woman?\n\nWoman. There\u2019s a great word to use. If sometimes Slimane\u2019s clothes have seemed squarely aimed at the resoundingly youthful \u2014 a notion specifically cited by Bernard Arnault, chief executive of Celine\u2019s owner LVMH, when the designer\u2019s appointment was announced last January \u2014 there was a maturity to this idea of a Celine woman. Sure, the models remained young \u2014 aren\u2019t they just about everywhere? But the clothes cut a wider swath in terms of both their fit, and their appeal. There were easy capes, high boots, cardigan-suits in sequins, draped silk dresses, brief tailored bombers, fantastic trenchcoats. Women strode forward, hands thrust in pockets, bags practically slung on shoulders. Everything flowed. There was a power to these clothes \u2014 and to the women wearing them. They could get stuff done.\n\nCeline \u00a9Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nCeline \u00a9Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nCeline \u00a9Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nWhy all the conjecture and over analysis? Plainly-put, these clothes looked great \u2014 expertly tailored, in expensive fabrics, with an aesthetic identity perfectly honed and polished. They were in such good taste, they floored you, made you want to use old-fashioned words to describe them, such as \u201cchic\u201d, which they were. They look like how people will want to dress. They were satisfying, and commercial in the best possible sense \u2014 which is, eminently desirable. If this collection was a record, it would be a hit \u2014 a hit, full of future greatest hits.\n\nCeline \u00a9Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nCeline \u00a9Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nCeline \u00a9Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nJo Ellison will be hosting the FT\u2019s Business of Luxury Summit in Madrid on May 19-21.

  "text": "Half the biggest US technology companies become too big. Some experts in the US have begun to argue that the likes of Facebook, Amazon, and Google have come to dominate their markets in an anticompetitive way. They are, they argue, the big oil or the railroad corporations of their day.\n\nThey particularly criticised the way in which some technology companies pick off upstart rivals, either by developing technology that looks very similar to theirs or simply by buying them up. Some say, for example, that Facebook has come to dominate online photosharing, in part by buying up Instagram and in part by developing Instagram stories, which looks very similar to Snapchat.\n\nThe problem for regulators has always been that, in the US, taking antitrust action relies on showing that the consumer has been harmed in some way, usually that prices have gone up. But the likes of Facebook and Google give their product away for free, while things bought on Amazon are often cheaper than they are elsewhere.\n\nFor that reason, some have begun to argue for a change of approach entirely, as far as their technology sector is concerned. This week, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was setting up a task force dedicated solely to looking at antitrust issues in the technology sector. That task force, the FTC said, would even go as far as to look at deals which it previously approved.\n\nFacebook, Instagram anyone? The FTC wouldn't say. Meanwhile, I've been talking to David Cicilline, the top US Democratic congressman as far as antitrust issues are concerned. He also thinks there's a problem. And he told me he has a rather radical solution for how to fix it. More on that next week on FT.com. For now, however, it seems clear that big tech might be becoming too big for its own good."

  "text": "As one of Europe\u2019s most affluent economies, Luxembourg has become a magnet for skilled professionals looking for well-paid jobs and low taxes.\n\nBut now the country\u2019s government is exploring whether ways can be found to convince some of these workers to spend more time away from the office, and maybe not even work inside the country at all.\n\nHomeworking is one idea Luxembourg has turned to as it seeks to cope with an unusual problem \u2014 one that highlights the country\u2019s economic success and the challenges that come with it: the fact that close to 200,000 people arrive in the grand duchy every day for work. The influx is equivalent to around 40 per cent of total employment in the country, bringing with it traffic jams and heightening environmental concerns.\n\nLuxembourg has already introduced programmes for civil servants to work from home, says economy minister \u00c9tienne Schneider. Now the country is keen to explore similar arrangements for cross-border commuters.\n\nWhile the idea appears simple, executing it strays into sensitive territory. \u201cOne problem that will have to be solved in that domain is the taxation,\u201d says Mr Schneider, noting the need for neighbouring countries to adapt their rules so that people can do more of their jobs for Luxembourg employers from homes without being ensnared by their domestic tax regimes.\n\nThe cross-border influx is emblematic of Luxembourg\u2019s situation: in many respects Luxembourg City is a regional capital for an area that stretches far wider than the grand duchy\u2019s borders. It is an engine for creating high-skilled jobs in everything from custodian banking to cyber security and satellite communications.\n\nNo other country in Europe can lay claim to having such as an open economy: 85 per cent of its products and services are exported, and more than 70 per cent of people who work in the country are not Luxembourgish. Two in five jobs are filled by non-residents.\n\nTo put it another way, only 28 per cent of Luxembourg\u2019s active population has a Luxembourgish ID card.\n\nMr Schneider is a member of the Luxembourg Socialist Workers\u2019 party and serves as deputy to the country\u2019s prime minister Xavier Bettel, who leads a three-party coalition of centrists, socialists and greens that has ruled the grand duchy since 2013. He notes that \u201cwe will soon have a majority of non-Luxembourgish people living in the country\u201d, given that the figure already stands at 48 per cent.\n\nIt is a success story founded on a determination to diversify and attract talent. Ever since the decline of its steel sector in the 1970s, Luxembourg has turned to other assets: its location in the heart of the EU, its multilingualism, its political stability and nimbleness to meet the needs of business.\n\nIt is an approach that covers everything from tax to regulation. But, to the annoyance of its neighbours, it also used to include a policy of banking secrecy and a readiness to allow multinational companies to play different national tax systems against each other, in the manner exposed in the 2014 LuxLeaks scandal, which exposed the tax avoidance activities of about 300 multinational companies.\n\nOur financial sector was built on a fiscal niche. That\u2019s not the case any more\n\nThe resilience of Luxembourg\u2019s economy was underlined during the years of the eurozone crisis: Luxembourg\u2019s real GDP growth averaged 3.2 per cent in 2010-16, compared with 1.1 per cent for the currency bloc as a whole.\n\nBut its competitive edge brings practical problems. One is pressure on house prices, which increased by 7 per cent last year.\n\n\u201cOf the 200,000 that are commuting every day, most of them would like to live here \u2014 but they don\u2019t earn enough to buy,\u201d Mr Schneider notes. \u201cWe are building housing facilities for 3,000 people a year but we need 6,000 to 7,000.\u201d\n\nThe government has introduced tax breaks to make it cheaper to buy, Mr Schneider says, but such measures are immediately absorbed into the prices demanded by sellers: \u201cFiscal incentives have not really worked out and have cost a lot of money to the government.\u201d\n\nThese pressures are set to increase with Brexit. \u201cThese people moving from London are used to high housing prices,\u201d Mr Schneider says. \u201cIf they move to Luxembourg, they will have the money to pay . . . That will have a direct impact on prices.\u201d\n\nLuxembourg attracts certain demographic groups. Younger professionals can work in the country for several years on career paths that can then take them to hipper metropolitan cities such as Berlin, Paris or London. At the same time, the grand duchy\u2019s well-regarded work-life balance, short travel distances, well-run public services and abundant green spaces often prove a winning mixture for families with young children. For Mr Schneider, \u201cif you are young, single and in a financial institution, you are motivated to move on because nothing holds you in the country . . . As soon as there is a family, people try if possible to stay.\u201d\n\nThe country has a reputation for staying ahead of the game in generating economic advantage but now faces the question of how best to sustain growth in a way that also sustains the country\u2019s quality of life.\n\nData from the national statistics office, STATEC, makes clear why long-term planning is needed: under some hypotheses, the number of cross-border workers could increase from nearly 200,00 now to 870,000 by 2060.\n\nMr Schneider says the government\u2019s goal is to shift Luxembourg towards a different type of economic model \u2014 one where growth is not reliant on continually pulling in more and more cross-border workers. The aim is \u201cto grow in a very sustainable way, and make sure our growth rates are much more based on productivity growth than on the growth of labour\u201d, he says.\n\nFor the deputy prime minister, a tougher international tax environment \u2014 including a suite of new EU laws and global conventions \u2014 means the country also has to turn the page on its days of using fiscal policy to get ahead.\n\n\u201cOur financial sector was built on a fiscal niche\u201d, he says, referring to banking secrecy. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case any more.\u201d Now, Luxembourg needs to focus on \u201ccompetence niches\u201d by building up new types of industry expertise.\n\nTilly Metz, a Luxembourgish Green member of the European Parliament, puts it bluntly. She says the current government took the decision that the country should no longer present itself \u201cas a fiscal paradise\u201d. The future, she argues, lies in building on the country\u2019s strengths to become an incubator for innovation.\n\nEfforts at fiscal reform have been welcomed by the European Commission. But Brussels still believes the country\u2019s tax regime is being exploited by multinationals. Its 2018 country report pointed to several problems, including \u201cthe lack of some anti-abuse rules\u201d that has created the risk \u201cthat the country\u2019s tax rules may still be used in tax avoidance structures\u201d."

  "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nMarch did not start well for some UK expats living in Luxembourg.\n\nBritish teachers and other staff seconded to European schools in the grand duchy have been put on notice that they could receive redundancy letters as early as April \u2014 although informal deals could provide a transition period for UK staff up to August 2020, or a year later if an exit deal is eventually approved.\n\nMany jobs at EU institutions based in Luxembourg are allocated according to quotas of nationals from member states. UK staff in these roles are therefore at immediate risk, regardless of any settlement for right to remain, should broader Brexit terms be agreed. The threat to such jobs demonstrates that Brexit is a threat as well as an opportunity to local employment.\n\nThe prospect of a no-deal Brexit dismays business leaders, even though Luxembourg\u2019s financial industry has benefited from the search for continuing single market access by London-based investment fund service, insurance and payment firms.\n\nTo date more than 50 companies have announced they are establishing or expanding operations in the grand duchy. Almost as many have plans in the pipeline, while others have quietly bolstered existing activities without advertising the fact, according to Nicolas Mackel, who heads industry promotional body Luxembourg for Finance.\n\nHowever, many of the country\u2019s financial and business community agree with fund manager Franklin Templeton\u2019s Denise Voss, who chairs fund industry group ALFI, that Brexit is \u201ca lose-lose\u201d for Luxembourg. This is because of the damage caused by legal and business uncertainty, along with the loss of Britain as an ally in EU debates on regulatory philosophy and financial rulemaking.\n\n\u201cBrexit will not bring overall benefits to anybody,\u201d says Hermann Beythan, an investment management partner at Linklaters Luxembourg.\n\nBritish expatriates are well integrated in Luxembourg\u2019s economy and society. \u201cThe government is doing everything possible to ease any problems that may arise,\u201d he says.\n\nBritish lawyers practising in the grand duchy are currently in limbo, especially those admitted to the bar by virtue of being qualified in another member state, for which EU nationality is a condition. UK lawyers who have already obtained the status of avocat \u00e0 la cour after three years\u2019 practice in Luxembourg, though, are assured of retaining it.\n\nCarlo Thelen, director-general and chief economist of the Luxembourg Chamber of Commerce, argues that smaller companies in the grand duchy may be particularly hard hit by the disruption caused by Brexit, since they admit to having made few preparations. \u201cThe UK is the fifth most important export destination for Luxembourg and seventh largest for imports, so we should not underestimate the impact.\u201d\n\nThe chamber has established a Brexit helpline for its members. Mr Thelen says typical questions are pragmatic: whether businesses can continue to recruit from the UK or send commercial representatives there, or conclude contracts with British companies and individuals.\n\nMr Mackel describes the roster of Brexit relocations to date, including 24 in asset management and services and 12 in insurance, as \u201ca silver lining \u2014 newly arrived firms are opening in Luxembourg almost every day\u201d.\n\nSteven Libby, leader of the asset and wealth management practice at PwC Luxembourg, says the country\u2019s fund industry faces a shake-up because one in six Ucits \u2014 EU-regulated funds sold to retail investors \u2014 are sold into the UK and 17 per cent of the industry\u2019s assets are run by UK-based portfolio managers.\n\nMr Mackel says he is standing by a previous estimate that Brexit relocations would create about 3,000 new financial centre jobs in Luxembourg by the end of 2019.\n\n\u201cThere is some job creation, but it is not a game-changer,\u201d he says. \u201cLast year we saw around 500 new jobs in asset management alone. Mostly new jobs are not people being relocated from London but recruited in the local market. It is an additional demand on a job market that has grown consistently in recent years. Brexit is not a strain on the job market of itself.\u201d\n\nMr Mackel says Brexit has helped boost Luxembourg\u2019s appeal to fintech start-ups, especially among the cluster of payment services firms in London.\n\n\u201cMany are keeping their presence in London but setting up operations on the continent in order to have a licence to serve clients elsewhere in Europe,\u201d he says.\n\nMr Thelen says his biggest regret about Brexit is potential loss of human interaction. \u201cThat is the real catastrophe \u2014 the threat to cultural exchanges, all the Luxembourgers studying in the UK and British students coming here,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope that will continue, even though it seems bound to become more complex. And if there is political change in the UK, maybe one day Britain will return.\u201d"

  "text": "At secondary school in Luxembourg in the 1980s, Marc Schiltz was determined to become a physicist \u2014 something that would require him to study abroad, like every other would-be scientist in the country.\n\nAmazingly, a prosperous nation with more than half a million inhabitants had no university until the beginning of this century and had spent very little on research.\n\nAfter a 20-year academic career elsewhere in Europe \u2014 France, the UK and Switzerland \u2014 Mr Schiltz returned in 2011 to lead what had become one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing scientific programmes, FNR, Luxembourg\u2019s National Research Fund.\n\nDuring his time abroad, the country had at last established the University of Luxembourg (in 2003) and set public research spending on a path that saw it rise about 15-fold to about \u20ac400m a year between 2000 and 2018.\n\n\u201cAlthough it meant moving from academia into research management, I liked the challenge of coming back to my home country and helping to set up a new research system,\u201d the 49-year-old says. \u201cFrom a build-up phase that really commenced at the turn of the millennium, public research has now entered its consolidation phase, during which it will have to prove its excellence and quality in a tough worldwide competition.\u201d\n\nFor the four-year period of 2018-2021, Luxembourg expects to spend a total \u20ac1.5bn on research and development, including block grants to the university and other institutions. FNR\u2019s budget over that period will be \u20ac340m.\n\nLuxembourg\u2019s public spending on R&D is now around 0.7 per cent of GDP \u201cwhich is close to the EU average\u201d, says Mr Schiltz. \u201cWe can do a bit better in the future. There is a multi-party political consensus and wide public support for research spending.\u201d\n\nThat consensus emerged during the 1990s when Luxembourg was enjoying an economic boom, thanks to its financial sector which thrived as a low-tax haven within the EU.\n\nThe country had reinvented its economy twice before, first during the late 19th century when steel production replaced farming as the biggest source of wealth and employment, and then again after the collapse of the steel industry in the 1970s when banking and finance took over. While the latter continue to thrive, Luxembourg\u2019s government began investing in science and innovation to reduce the economy\u2019s reliance on finance through building a high-tech sector.\n\nOne sign of this diversification was the establishment of the Luxembourg Space Agency last year and the promotion of the country as a destination for space businesses, from innovative satellite operators, to companies that aim to extract resources from asteroids.\n\n\u201cI have to explain to researchers that, as a small country, we cannot do everything,\u201d says Mr Schiltz. \u201cThere is flexibility in the system, which helps us to attract scientists to Luxembourg. They tell me it\u2019s a place where they can help to shape the system. We don\u2019t want to be too restrictive but we do have priority areas.\u201d\n\nThe outflow of talented Luxembourgish students to the rest of the world has reversed\n\nSome of the priorities reflect the nature of the Luxembourg economy, including the needs of the service sector and now space too. The country is home to SES, one of the world\u2019s largest satellite operators.\n\nInformation and communications technology (ICT) is important, with an emphasis on security and data communications in finance and satellite communications. FNR is also funding research into \u201cautonomous systems\u201d including command-and-control technology for robots working in space.\n\nIn biomedicine, the emphasis is on \u201cbringing together the life sciences and data sciences\u201d, says Mr Schiltz. A showcase is research into Parkinson\u2019s disease. FNR supports a national study cohort of Parkinson\u2019s patients, whose samples are analysed to find \u201cbiomarkers\u201d that indicate different forms of the disease, with different prognoses and different recommendations for treatment. For Parkinson\u2019s, he says, \u201cthis is the highest-quality data in the world\u201d.\n\nThe geographical heart of Luxembourgish science is the Belval Innovation Campus south-west of the capital. It is the centrepiece of a \u20ac1bn urban regeneration project, one of the largest in Europe. Belval houses the university, research centres and business incubators.\n\nA feature of national life is its outward-looking cosmopolitan attitude. Non-Luxembourgers make up almost half of the population and Mr Schiltz was determined that an outward-looking attitude should apply to science, too. \u201cThere was a certain risk in setting up a research system in Luxembourg that could become inward-looking,\u201d he says. So international links were emphasised from the start. That was demonstrated in 2017 when Mr Schiltz was elected head of Science Europe, the association of European research funding organisations. \u201cTheir collaboration can impact the future of Europe in a way no single organisation would be able to achieve on its own,\u201d he says.\n\nOver the past 15 years, the outflow of talented Luxembourgish students to the rest of the world has been reversed. No less than 80 per cent of scientists in Luxembourg are foreign nationals. The Marc Schiltz equivalents at school today will be able to experience an international scientific programme as students in their own country."

  "text": "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nForeign nationals currently make up around 48 per cent of Luxembourg\u2019s population, which officially stood at 602,000 at the beginning of 2019.\n\nThe proportion would have been even higher but for a rising trend among foreign residents to take Luxembourgish nationality.\n\nAccording to figures provided by justice minister F\u00e9lix Braz, a total of 13,185 people acquired Luxembourg passports in 2018, up from 10,095 the previous year and just 2,796 in 2016 \u2014 the year before the introduction of legislation that eased the requirements significantly.\n\nLast year\u2019s total included 4,632 people who obtained nationality through \u201crecovery\u201d, which restores citizenship to people obliged to give it up through marriage, or for those with an ancestor from Luxembourg. Most, however, were foreign nationals living in the country.\n\nDespite the looming threat of Brexit, the largest number were French nationals at 2,785, followed by 1,601 Belgians, 1,593 Portuguese, 931 Brazilians and 667 Americans. Britons were down in eighth place with 435.\n\nThe nationality law, which took effect in April 2017, reduced the number of years of residence required from seven to five. Applicants must also pass a Luxembourgish language test, although those with 20 years\u2019 residence or more only have to attend classes. They must also either take a course or pass an exam on \u201cliving together in the grand duchy\u201d \u2014 a subject that encompasses citizens\u2019 rights, Luxembourg institutions and history, and European integration.\n\nThe naturalisation procedure is a habitual topic of small talk among expats in the country. \u201cI know many people who came to Luxembourg years ago and decided to stay, and who systematically have been going through the process to take Luxembourg nationality,\u201d says PwC partner Steven Libby, who arrived from California in 1991.\n\nBriton Carol Abel came to Luxembourg in 1984 to join the European Parliament while her husband Paul made a career in the grand duchy\u2019s financial industry. She says they took Luxembourg nationality seven years ago when concern began to grow that the UK\u2019s EU membership might be at risk.\n\n\u201cHaving already lived in Luxembourg for more 20 years, we qualified to apply for nationality, and the process was quite straightforward. Today we are happy and proud to be Luxembourgers and Europeans.\u201d\n\nThere are other benefits. According to the Nomad Passport Index 2018, a Luxembourg passport is the best of 199 worldwide for ease of international travel, ahead of Ireland and Switzerland, allowing visa-free entry to 177 countries. By comparison, the UK and the US rank 22nd and 35th.\n\nMany applicants for Luxembourg nationality today are non-EU citizens who would benefit from the ability to change employer more easily, says Tina Moeller, a language teacher who was born in Denmark but has lived in Luxembourg since childhood.\n\nMs Moeller has been coaching candidates for the language test for the past 17 years \u2014 she averages around 20 a year \u2014 and says none of her students has failed to pass first time.\n\n\u201cOver the years more and more expatriates have been coming to Luxembourg to work for a specific company, then decide to make it their permanent home,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cDemand is biggest from non-EU nationals led by Russians, Chinese, Americans, Canadians and Indians, especially from people in the financial sector. Once they have an EU passport, their life is much easier, so they are very focused on passing the test. But I also have clients whose priority is communicating with their children, who have learnt Luxembourgish in the national school system.\u201d\n\nMs Moeller also teaches staff sent by the Big Four audit firms and by Luxembourg\u2019s Centre Hospitalier medical centre.\n\nEU nationals do not require a work permit to take up a job in the grand duchy. Non-EU nationals \u2014 which may soon include Britons \u2014 must have a work permit, usually applied for by their potential employer.\n\nOrganisations first need to be able to demonstrate that they are unable recruit an EU or EEA national for the post."

  "text": "As a way of making good on a pledge to get people out of their cars, Luxembourg\u2019s decision at the end of last year to scrap tickets on its public transport system was hard to beat.\n\nBe it buses, trams, or even rail services entering the country\u2019s territory from abroad, once you are inside the grand duchy, all public transport will be free from March 2020.\n\nEstonia already has free public transport for residents of its capital Tallinn and other county districts. But Luxembourg\u2019s initiative is the first such scheme in the world that is truly countrywide.\n\nPublic transport in one of Europe\u2019s smallest states is already cheap \u2014 locals can criss-cross the country for \u20ac2. But Luxembourg\u2019s growing affluence has resulted in it having the highest rate of car ownership in the EU, with 662 passenger vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants.\n\nThis love affair with the car, combined with large numbers of cross-border commuters, has created a growing problem of traffic congestion across the duchy, particularly at peak times. Fran\u00e7ois Bausch, Luxembourg\u2019s transport minister and Green member of parliament, says the groundbreaking project is \u201cthe cherry on the cake of a large new strategy of mobility for the country\u201d.\n\nThe need for that investment is clear \u2014 concerns about traffic congestion have rocketed up the country\u2019s political agenda because of the growing volume of cross-border commuters.\n\n\u201cWe have a very specific situation,\u201d Mr Bausch says. \u201cNo country in Europe has a situation like we have.\u201d Some 200,000 people crowd into the country each working day from abroad. Congestion times are among the highest in Europe, with each driver spending on average 30 hours stuck in jams every year, according to EU data.\n\nFree riders: State to scrap fares to tackle traffic jams\n\nGovernment\u2019s plans are extensive, and, unusually for a national transport strategy, they stretch beyond its borders. The overarching plan includes funding to upgrade the rail link to Thionville in France and to invest in park-and-ride schemes on the other side of the French border. Some 300km of cycle routes are also being laid out, as well as moves designed to further encourage car sharing by commuters.\n\nThe aim is to support economic development in the \u201cwhole greater region\u201d that has Luxembourg City as its centre, Mr Bausch says. The plans to double the capacity of rail routes to France will alone cost \u20ac620m.\n\nOne sign of change is already very visible: a new tram system that was opened in December 2017. The tram line currently covers about 5km and links the centre of Luxembourg City to the business and EU institutional district of Kirchberg in the north-east.\n\nThe government\u2019s plans, unusually for a national transport strategy, stretch beyond its borders\n\nThe reintroduction of tram transport follows its abandonment 50 years ago. Initial take-up of the new service is good, with passenger numbers exceeding government projections. The tram network is set to be steadily expanded over the next five years, with plans to link it to the central rail station.\n\nFor Mr Bausch, the tram was also an attempt to redefine the image of public transport identified with crowded buses. The trams are virtually silent, have at-seat USB charging sockets and a colourful interior of pinks and blues. These are not the only embellishments: each stop is announced with its musical motif, while information screens in the interior display the number of minutes remaining to every stop on the line.\n\nDahlia Englaro, a local student, says that the system is already being well used. \u201cIt is on time, and it has made it easier to get around, for example to Kirchberg. It\u2019s practical.\u201d\n\nAnother passenger, a retired magistrate who did not want to be named, says that the tram was \u201cnot a white elephant,\u201d although it would not be enough to solve the congestion problems. \u201cThere is no right solution,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are too many people coming to work in Kirchberg.\u201d\n\nAgainst all these other investments, the move to free public transport is a relatively cheap step that has garnered much publicity \u2014 the annual income the country makes from ticket sales is about \u20ac40m. \u201cCompared to the whole investment in the mobility sector [the scrapping of fares] is really small money,\u201d says Mr Bausch.\n\nThe question is, will all this really do enough to get both Luxembourgers and cross-border commuters out of their cars? Policymakers concede that a residual snobbery about using public transport continues to encourage car use.\n\n\u201cFor me, the answer lies in the quality of the alternatives,\u201d Mr Bausch says. \u201cPublic transport must come out of the niche that it was in the past, when it was seen as only good for people who did not have a car . . . You must have a complete change in image.\u201d\n\nOne thorny question has been what to do about first-class travel on the soon-to-be-free system. After much deliberation it was decided to keep it as a paid-for tier, not least to avoid confusion on cross-border services.\n\nThe apparently simple task of providing free public transport has proven more culturally complex than one might have imagined."

  "text": "In the south of Luxembourg, along the border with France, a former steelworks site is offering a template for brownfield redevelopment that according to its advocates is attracting interest from observers across Europe.\n\nFor a century, Belval was a massive steelworks site operated by Arbed, now part of ArcelorMittal, with six blast furnaces and employing thousands of people at its peak in the 1960s and 1970s. Now the site situated between the country\u2019s second city, Esch-sur-Alzette, and neighbouring Sanem is home to Luxembourg\u2019s university, its only purpose-built rock music venue, and a thriving start-up scene.\n\n\u201cWe have already seen visitors come from countries such as Belgium and Poland to understand how we did it,\u201d says Gilles Feider, vice-chairman of Agora, the public-private partnership redeveloping the site. \u201cAnd it is still a work in progress.\u201d\n\nAfter the steelmaker switched to electric steel production and shut down its blast furnaces, Agora was created in 2000 to create a new urban district on the site. First came the Rockhal, which opened in 2005 to host large-scale pop music concerts by the likes of Mariah Carey, Bryan Adams and Shakira.\n\nThis was followed by an office opening for Banque Internationale \u00e0 Luxembourg and a commercial complex with shopping mall, caf\u00e9s, restaurants and a multiplex cinema. Belval will eventually also include housing for 7,000 people. Two blast furnaces remain on the site as a symbol of the area\u2019s industrial heritage and a tourist attraction, renovated and maintained by the state.\n\n\u201cOriginally, we thought we could complete the project in 15 years, but ultimately it will be more like 25.\u201d says Mr Feider. \u201cIn the beginning it was difficult to attract developers to the site, but today there is no longer a problem.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledges that there was concern over a development seen as too far and too isolated from Luxembourg City, the country\u2019s economic hub.\n\nCritical mass has come with the establishment in Belval of the main campus of the University of Luxembourg and a railway connection. A biomedicine facility was the first to open in Belval in 2011, with the first undergraduates arriving in September 2015.\n\n\u201cThe university gave us the final impulsion that we needed, to bring the diversity of young people and their teachers alongside the people living and working there,\u201d Mr Feider says. \u201cToday we also have retirement homes, so all parts of society are represented. In the past the commercial centre was fairly empty at weekends, but now it is full of people.\u201d\n\nWe have seen visitors come from countries such as Belgium and Poland to understand how we did it\n\nResidents, students and local workers say the project has its teething troubles. Undergraduates complain that there is insufficient accommodation available nearby and a shortage of affordable entertainment as well as a lack of green spaces. In common with much of Luxembourg, Belval suffers from a shortage of car parking and big events at the Rockhal create large traffic jams.\n\nMr Feider acknowledges that there is still work to do. \u201cIn the middle the Belval Square Mile, the heart of the whole site, is only now being developed.\u201d\n\nBelval\u2019s aim is to create synergies between the university and the Technoport incubator facility, installed in a former steel industry site under the guidance of Luxinnovation, the national innovation agency.\n\nThese efforts are starting to bear fruit, according to Patrizia Luchetta, an adviser to IT and biotech businesses setting up in Luxembourg, many of which have premises in Belval. \u201cIt was a political decision to put the university in Belval, and it\u2019s hard to start something like that from scratch, but it is amazing what they have achieved,\u201d she says.\n\nThe Technoport is largely full, while the intended mingling between those working at the university and adjacent industrial zones is occurring, adds Ms Luchetta. taking off. \u201cWhile it\u2019s true that Belval is still less lively at weekends than the city, it\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d\n\nMr Feider says the Belval project has had to be self-financing. \u201cAgora is not a promoter that needs to make a particular margin, but the project should at least pay for itself and make a bit of profit,\u201d he says. \u201cOver time we moved out of the red and into the black.\u201d\n\nLessons from Belval will be applied to the redevelopment of another former steelworks site a few miles to the east in Schifflange, he adds.\n\n\u201cIn Belval some stakeholders felt left out, especially the general public, so the planning process will be more open for Schifflange.\u201d"

  "authors": [

    "Nina Ricci"
  ],
  "text": "Is Puig becoming one of luxury\u2019s big disrupters? They\u2019ve been doing some interesting business of late. The Spanish beauty group bought a majority stake in fashion label Dries Van Noten last year and, thanks to designer Julien Dossena, Puig has pushed Paco Rabanne from a place of moribund irrelevance to respectable fashionability in recent years. While it banks its fortunes on fragrances, this attention to more fashionable concerns is perhaps worthy of note.\n\nLast August, Puig made an even more unlikely announcement: the appointment of Rushemy Botter and Lisi Herrebrugh, the duo behind the menswear brand Botter, as the new creative directors of Nina Ricci. The French house has been part of Puig since 1998.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nBarely anyone has heard of Botter. The brand got some attention last year when the pair were shortlisted for the LVMH Prize and they received the Grand Prize at the Festival d\u2019Hy\u00e8res where their designs were bold, colourful and adorned with inflatable balloons. They seemed the least likely successors at a house known for its bourgeois elegance and the flighty fragrance, L\u2019Air de Temps. But then stranger things have happened \u2014 look at the success of Balenciaga. Fashion legends have been created via the Unknown Designer Law.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nNina Ricci is a challenge. The closest it got to being commercial was under Peter Copping, who stayed faithful to its delicate aesthetic and delivered lots of lacy, very pretty little knits. Under Guillaume Henry it became more bourgeois and abandoned its client base. For better or worse, Botter and Herrebrugh have inherited a blank slate.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nThis first outing did not have the makings of a legend but was instead a pleasant enough collection of some clothes. To find their modern elegance, and by rooting through the archive, the designers had focused on fluidity and movement instead of the house\u2019s famous florals, and rather than pretty dresses they showed pinstripe suiting, scuba and lots of organza shirts. Some of them looked a bit like beach mats with a ruffle trim.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nNot surprisingly for a team with roots in menswear, there were mannish elements here. The tailoring was tidy and there were many of the more athletic signatures that now define that market; a swimsuit functioned as an alternative corset, and there were polo-necks, too. In a season in which few brands have done athleisure \u2014 even Off-White was surprisingly demure \u2014 this was a rare moment that sportswear got a look in.\n\n\u00a9 Jason Lloyd-Evans\n\nWill it succeed? Nina Ricci is a difficult brand to make seem relevant. This made for an interesting starter, but it needed more meat on the plate.\n\nJo Ellison will be hosting the FT\u2019s Business of Luxury Summit in Madrid on May 19-21.
