  "text": "A Michigan couple who rarely spent a day apart after 56 years of marriage died on the same day in the hospital.\n\nJudy and Will Webb of Southgate, Michigan, both 77, were holding hands before they died in a hospice center on March 6, their daughter, MaryBeth Webb, told ABC Detroit affiliate WXYZ.\n\nThey first connected at the age of 14, according to WXYZ. When Will Webb enlisted in the U.S. military, Judy Webb would write letters to him, their daughter said.\n\n\"They just became friends and have been together ever since,\" MaryBeth Webb said.\n\nWill and Judy Webb, both 77 years old, died just hours apart while holding hands on March 6, 2019.\n\n\n\nThey spent their final hours together in hospice care after both battling a series of health complications. https://t.co/EZAyd63avQ \u2014 WXYZ Detroit (@wxyzdetroit) March 22, 2019\n\nLater, Will Webb worked nights as a printer and Judy Webb worked days at a local hospital. She would stay up late to wait for him to get home every night.\n\nMaryBeth Webb said her parents are the reason her family is tight-knit.\n\n\"We just had a lot of fun -- a lot of good times,\" MaryBeth Webb said.\n\nThe couple rarely spent a day apart before their health started to decline late last year, their daughter said.\n\nIn December, Judy Webb's health began to suffer following a medical procedure that \"basically didn't go well,\" MaryBeth Webb told The News-Herald. She suffered from an infection that almost killed her on New Year's Eve and was then transported to Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, where she remained on a ventilator, their daughter told the Southgate-based newspaper.\n\n(WXYZ) MaryBeth Webb looks at family photos of her parents, Judy and Will Webb, married for 56 years before they died within hours of each other on March 6, 2019.\n\nThe next day, Will Webb collapsed from exhaustion, The News-Herald reported.\n\n\u201cMy dad \u2014 seeing her like that \u2014 it was too much for him,\u201d MaryBeth Webb told the newspaper. \u201cFrom that point on, everything that happened to her happened to him in a different place.\"\n\nWhen Judy Webb spiked a fever, so did her husband. When she began to suffer from congestion, he got pneumonia, and their health failures continued to parallel each other's until they died, their daughter said.\n\nAfter Will Webb was put into hospice care, his wife requested that she be placed there too.\n\nOn the day they died, their beds had been pushed together and they were holding hands, MaryBeth Webb told WXYZ. Will Webb died at 2 a.m., and Judy Webb died just hours later, their daughter said.\n\nShe continued, \"When my dad died, my mom just kind of \u2013 she wasn\u2019t responsive at all, verbally -- but you could see her pick up her hand and she was rubbing my dad\u2019s hand like, 'I\u2019ll be there soon.'\"\n\n(WXYZ) Judy and Will Webb spent 56 years married to one another before they died within hours of each other on March 6.\n\nMaryBeth Webb said her parents \"didn't want to live without each other,\" describing their relationship as \"a great love story.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m happy that they went together and don\u2019t have to suffer losing each other, but it\u2019s still hard,\" MaryBeth Webb told The News-Herald.\n\nThe couple leaves behind three daughters, five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, according to their obituary."

  "text": "Special counsel Robert Mueller's report into the Kremlin's interference in the 2016 presidential election did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia, according to a letter to Congress from Attorney General William Barr.\n\nThe letter describes \"two main\" Russian efforts to influence the election including \u201cattempts by a Russian organization\u2026 to conduct disinformation and social media operations in the United States\u201d and \u201cthe Russian government\u2019s efforts to conduct computer hacking operations\u201d targeting former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic Party.\n\nIn both circumstances, the \u201cSpecial Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts.\u201d\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s office made no conclusion on the matter of possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump.\n\n\"The Special Counsel, therefore, did not draw a conclusion \u2013 one way or the other \u2013 as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction,\" the letter read. \"Instead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out 'difficult issues' of law and fact concerning whether the President's actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction.\"\n\nIn his communique to lawmakers, Barr underscored that the special counsel states that \u201cwhile this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\u201d\n\n(Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images) Special Counsel Robert Mueller, March 24, 2019, in Washington, D.C. Special counsel Robert Mueller has delivered his report on alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election to Attorney General William Barr.\n\nWhile Mueller\u2019s report did not reach a conclusion as to whether obstruction of justice occurred, Attorney General Barr\u2019s letter said he determined a case for obstruction was not warranted.\n\n\u201cIn cataloging the President\u2019s actions many of which took place in public view, the report identities no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent, each of which, under the Department's principles of federal prosecution guiding charging decisions, would need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish an obstruction-of-justice offense.\"\n\nBarr said his intent is to release as much as possible but there are grand jury secrecy concerns with some portions.\n\nThe White House celebrated the news, with President Donald Trump hailing the report on Twitter and, later in comments to reporters, as an \"exoneration.\"\n\n\"This was an illegal takedown that failed and hopefully, someone is going to be looking at the other side,\" Trump told reporters on Sunday.\n\nHe tweeted: \"No Collusion, No Obstruction, Complete and Total EXONERATION. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!\"\n\nNo Collusion, No Obstruction, Complete and Total EXONERATION. KEEP AMERICA GREAT! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 24, 2019\n\n\"The Special Counsel did not find any collusion and did not find any obstruction,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. \"Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein further determined there was no obstruction. The findings of the Department of Justice are a total and complete exoneration of the President of the United States.\u201d\n\nJay Sekulow, one of President Trump\u2019s lawyers, told ABC News chief anchor George Stephanopoulos that the report was a \"complete win for the president and the American people.\"\n\n\"Not just a win.\" Sekulow said. \"The entire basis upon which this inquiry was instituted was a concern over collusion between the Russian government and the trump campaign, Bob Mueller and the Department of Justice could not be clearer. To have the obstruction issue even as a viable one, which it was not, there would have to be an underlying crime, which there wasn't.\"\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., questioned the timing of the letter tweeting \"Special Counsel Mueller worked for 22 months to determine the extent to which President Trump obstructed justice. Attorney General Barr took 2 days to tell the American people that while the President is not exonerated, there will be no action by DOJ.\" He later tweeted that \"in light of the very concerning discrepancies and final decision making at the Justice Department following the Special Counsel report,\" the House Judiciary Committee will be calling Barr in to testify in the near future.\n\nIn his letter to members of Congress on Sunday, Barr described the breadth of the special counsel\u2019s extensive and exhaustive probe. Mueller\u2019s 19 prosecutors and 40 FBI agents issued more than 2,800 subpoenas, executed nearly 500 search warrants, and interviewed approximately 500 witnesses, Barr wrote, the results of which amounted to 37 indictments and six guilty pleas to date.\n\nThe news comes amid Democrats continued calls for the full release of the findings.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in a joint letter, seemed to sum up the sentiment of many congressional Democrats in saying that Barr's letter \"raises as many questions as it answers\" and that Congress \"requires the full report and the underlying documents.\"\n\n\"The fact that Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s report does not exonerate the president on a charge as serious as obstruction of justice demonstrates how urgent it is that the full report and underlying documentation be made public without any further delay,\" they wrote. \"Given Mr. Barr\u2019s public record of bias against the Special Counsel\u2019s inquiry, he is not a neutral observer and is not in a position to make objective determinations about the report.\"\n\nThe congressional leaders also took issues with the president's claims of being \"exonerated.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail and on the Hill, Democrats made clear they are going to want every detail and document about the investigation and some have said they are willing to use their subpoena power in order to get it.\n\n\"It means make the request, if the request is denied subpoena, if the subpoenas are denied we will hold people before the Congress and yes, we will prosecute in court as necessary to get this information,\" House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Sunday on \"This Week\".\n\nDemocratic candidates running to unseat President Donald Trump in 2020 reacted quickly to the news that Mueller delivered his report to DOJ with one consistent message: Make it public.\n\n\"The Mueller report must be made public \u2014 all of it,\" Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-NY said in a presidential campaign speech outside the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York City.\n\n\"The Mueller report must be made public \u2014 all of it,\" Sen.

Barr has promised to be as transparent as possible, but it's unclear how extensive or detailed Barr's own \"report\" to Congress will be.\n\nIn a letter to the leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary committees, Barr wrote that he intends to \"consult with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Special Counsel Mueller to determine what other information from the report can be released to Congress and the public consistent with the law.\"\n\nA senior Department of Justice official told ABC News on Friday that the report would not include any further indictments.\n\nMueller and his team investigated how far the Kremlin went to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, including trying to determine whether any Americans may have helped those efforts.\n\nAt the heart of Mueller\u2019s probe were two Russian operations: the spread of disinformation on social media, and the release of thousands of sensitive emails stolen by hackers from the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic targets. Mueller\u2019s team has charged 25 Russian nationals and three foreign companies for their alleged role in those operations.\n\nIn appointing a special counsel to investigate, however, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein also directed Mueller to look into \u201callegations\u201d of possible \u201ccoordination\u201d between Russian operatives and associates of President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies have derided the investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d But Rosenstein, FBI Director Chris Wray and Barr have each explicitly disputed that description.\n\nAt least four Trump associates, including Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, have pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents during the Russia-related investigation.\n\nAnother Trump associate, the president\u2019s former attorney Michael Cohen, has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump\u2019s business dealings in Moscow. And former Trump adviser Roger Stone has been charged with lying to Congress about his alleged role in tracking information stolen from Democrats during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n(Leah Millis/Reuters) The Department of Justice building is pictured in Washington D.C., March 21, 2019.\n\nMueller\u2019s investigation grew out of a probe the FBI launched in late July 2016.\n\nBy then, the FBI was already scrutinizing Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort\u2019s business dealings with pro-Russian officials in Ukraine \u2013 dealings that have since landed Manafort in jail. And the FBI was keeping tabs on Trump adviser Carter Page, who was previously targeted for recruitment by Russian spies and had raised eyebrows with a trip to Moscow in mid-July 2016.\n\nBut claims by Trump adviser George Papadopoulos \u2013 that the Russians were touting \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton \u2013 really set off alarms inside the FBI.\n\n\u201cIf any Americans were part of helping the Russians [attack] us, that is a very big deal,\u201d James Comey, who was FBI director at the time, later told lawmakers.\n\nSeveral weeks after formally launching the Russia probe, counterintelligence agents leading the investigation in Washington received a so-called \u201cdossier,\u201d which had been compiled at the behest of Democrats and detailed uncorroborated allegations of coordination between Trump\u2019s campaign and the Kremlin.\n\nSome of the allegations involved Page, who was already on the FBI\u2019s radar, so agents began secretly intercepting his communications. Page has never been charged with any crimes.\n\nThe wide-ranging investigation continued even after Trump took office. After Jeff Sessions became attorney general, he recused himself from oversight of the FBI\u2019s Russia-related probe, citing his previous advocacy for Trump on the campaign trail.\n\nRosenstein subsequently assumed oversight of the investigation.\n\nAnd then Trump shocked the federal law enforcement community: He fired Comey.\n\nThe move prompted Rosenstein to appoint Mueller to take over the whole matter, including a review of whether Comey's firing and other actions meant Trump improperly tried to obstruct the probe.\n\nComey later alleged that in a private meeting with Trump before his removal, the president directed Comey to \u201clet [Flynn] go.\u201d\n\nMueller has not released any evidence suggesting Trump committed a crime related to Russian efforts.\n\nHowever, Mueller did uncover evidence of other possible crimes and referred those cases to other federal prosecutors.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Manhattan ended up tying Trump to federal campaign violations, alleging that \u2013 in the midst of the 2016 presidential campaign \u2013 Trump personally directed Cohen to silence two woman claiming affairs with Trump by making illegal payments to them; Trump has repeatedly denied the affairs.\n\nCohen has pleaded guilty for his role in the matter, but no other charges have been filed.\n\nABC News' Pierre Thomas, John Santucci and Kyra Phillips contributed to this report."

I love this country as much as I can anything -- my family, my country, my God, but what they did was a false narrative. It was a terrible thing.

Trump also said he isn't thinking about pardoning anyone sentenced during the probe.\n\nThe summary of the report, submitted to Congress Sunday by Barr, said there was no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Mueller did not come to a conclusion on obstruction of justice, according to Barr's summary, so Barr took that on himself, concluding that the evidence Muller found didn't support a charge, although Barr didn't reveal all that Mueller discovered.\n\nCongressional Democrats continue to demand the full report from Mueller.\n\nLast week, the president told reporters at the White House, \"let it come out, let people see it.\"\n\nThe president has claimed \"complete and total exoneration\" from the report, which White House press secretary Sarah Sanders insisted was justified despite Mueller stating, according to Barr, that his not making a decision on the question did not amount to an exoneration on the matter of obstruction.\n\nSanders was asked on NBC Monday morning to acknowledge that it was incorrect to say the report is a full vindication for the president.\n\n\"Not at all. It is,\" she said.\n\n\"It is a complete and total exoneration, and here's why, because the special counsel, they said they couldn't make a decision one way or the other. The way the process works is then they leave that up to the attorney general. The attorney general and the deputy attorney general went through and based their decision on Mueller's investigation. This wasn't based on just their own ideas and their own thinking. It was based on Mueller's investigation,\" Sanders said.\n\n(Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images) Special Counsel Robert Mueller leaves after attending church on March 24, 2019 in Washington, D.C.\n\nCritics, however, rejected Trump's claims of exoneration -- and rejected the notion that Barr was objective in his summary.\n\n\"Given Mr. Barr\u2019s public record of bias against the Special Counsel\u2019s inquiry, he is not a neutral observer and is not in a position to make objective determinations about the report,\" Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement over the weekend.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, criticized Barr's quick turnover of a summary on an investigation that took almost two years and said Barr is likely to be subpoenaed to explain his actions and conclusions.\n\n\"We will ask the attorney general to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. We will demand the release of the full report. The American people are entitled to a full accounting of the president's misconduct referenced by the special counsel,\" Nadler said at a press conference over the weekend in New York district..\n\nIn a tweet over the weekend, Nadler described \"very concerning discrepancies\" within the report and \"final decision making at the Justice Department.\" The report \"did not exonerate the President,\" Nadler tweeted.\n\nFormer U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, said that while the case on collusion \"is closed,\" on the issue of obstruction of justice, \"we're sort of not done.\"\n\n\"It seems to me it was a very close case. Bob Mueller decided not to make a determination about whether or not a charge can be brought, and you only do that if there is substantial evidence of obstruction,\" Bharara said on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" Monday.\n\nWhile it's clear Congress will continue to investigate the questions around obstruction of justice, it remains to be seen whether the president will be receptive to those questions.\n\nAsked on \"Good Morning America\" if the president was prepared to cooperate with any continuing investigations in the House, one of the president's lawyers, Jay Sekulow, said it would be a waste of taxpayer money, listing off all of the evidence Mueller obtained in the probe that lasted the past 22 months.\n\n\u201cI think the reality is that Congress is wasting the taxpayers' money, frankly, and they should be going about legislating and governing rather than continuing this that is a prerogative they have,\u201d Sekulow said. \u201cI think at this point it\u2019s ridiculous to put people through this.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s attorney Jay Sekulow on the Mueller report: \u201dI think the reality is that congress is wasting the tax payers' money.\u201d https://t.co/HUcY9gPmao pic.twitter.com/dqMkc7ZIVn \u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) March 25, 2019\n\nTrump went as far as to call the entire investigation an \"\u201cillegal takedown that failed\" on Sunday. Trump made the claim despite Mueller having been appointed as special counsel by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein after the president's own decision to fire then-FBI Director James Comey, who was leading an investigation into possible Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Trump and congressional Republicans have claimed that there was wrongdoing in the way the investigation was carried out.\n\nCounselor to the president Kellyanne Conway aired those grievances Monday morning, sharing sharp criticism of those who \"let this lie fly for two years, hanging and harrassing and trying to embarass -- and worse -- those of us connected to the 2016 campaign.\" Those critics now owe Trump, his family and the country an apology, Conway said on Fox News.\n\nConway specifically called out Rep. Adam Schiff, a critic of the president and a Democrat who heads the House Intelligence Committee.\n\n\"He ought to resign today,\" Conway said. \"He has been on every TV show 50 times a day for practically the last two years promising Americans that the president would either be impeached or indicted.\"\n\nConway also previewed the way the administration will seek to use the Mueller report in the face of upcoming Congressional investigations, despite almost two years spent escalating attacks on the investigation and Mueller as biased and a witch hunt.\n\n\"Bob Mueller already ran the fair and the full investigation. And any partisan, politicized investigation from here on in will never have the credibility of the Mueller investigation, and the credibility of Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein -- what they have done here,\" Conway said."

  "text": "The Kremlin has responded cautiously to the conclusion of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation that found no evidence of a conspiracy by Donald Trump's presidential campaign to help Russia interfere in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday he couldn't comment on Mueller's findings since no one had seen the report in full, and he denied again that Russia had meddled in 2016.\n\n\"We haven\u2019t seen the report itself,\" Peskov said in a daily briefing call with reporters. \"We have seen a certain condensed version, a summary, which, moreover, tells nothing new, except the acknowledgment of the absence of any conspiracy.\"\n\nReiterating Russia's long-standing blanket denial that it had interfered in the 2016 election, Peskov said of Mueller's investigation, \"It's hard to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if it's not there.\"\n\nAttorney General William Barr on Sunday released a summary of the key findings of Mueller\u2019s 22-month investigation into Russia's effort to influence the 2016 election. In a letter to Congress, Barr quoted from Mueller's own report that the special counsel had found no evidence that Trump or anyone associated with his campaign had conspired with Russia, \"despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.\"\n\nPeskov rejected that Russia had sought to aid Trump or meddled in 2016 in any way. He also rejected Mueller's finding that Moscow mounted a two-pronged influence operation targeting American social media and an hacking attack that stole and then leaked documents from the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign.\n\nOther Russian officials' reactions were far more strident, however.\n\nRussia's foreign ministry criticized Mueller\u2019s investigation in a Monday statement as a waste of time and resources, and said the accusation of Russian interference was an \"obvious fake.\"\n\nAlexei Pushkov, head of the Russian Senate's information committee, wrote on Twitter, \"The results of Mueller\u2019s investigation are a disgrace for the U.S. and its political elites.\"\n\n(Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images) Special counsel Robert Mueller walks with his wife Ann Mueller, March 24, 2019, in Washington, D.C. Mueller has delivered his report on alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election to Attorney General William Barr.\n\nMueller\u2019s investigation saw 34 people charged, among them six Trump aides and advisers. Twenty-five Russians, many of them military intelligence officers, were indicted for their role in the hack of Democratic party institutions, or for taking part in the social media campaign. In those indictments, Mueller laid out how the Russia\u2019s intelligence services and a so-called \"troll factory\" in Saint Petersburg had sought to influence the U.S. electorate.\n\nRussian officials and state media for two years have insisted the accusations of election meddling are fantasies invented by the Democrats to be used as a pretext to sanction Moscow.\n\nOn Monday, the Russian foreign ministry also attacked the Obama administration, accusing it of trying \"to discredit Trump\" in 2016 by making \"unfounded accusations of 'hacking attacks.'\"\n\nThe Obama administration in 2016 agonized over how to make Russia's election operations public, former administration officials have since said. In the end, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National intelligence released a joint statement in October 2016 noting the Russian efforts, but leaving out whether the Russians had sought to help a particular candidate.\n\nWith Mueller's investigation over, some Russian lawmakers said they now hoped Trump would be able to improve relations with Russia, but most expressed doubts.\n\n\"There is a chance to reset much in our relations, but whether Trump will risk it remains an open question. We, obviously, are ready,\" politician Konstantin Kosachev wrote in a Facebook post, adding he hoped Trump would use the moment to begin negotiations on two key arms agreements, the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces and the START treaties.\n\nBut Kosachev wrote he doubted U.S. attitudes towards Russia or the enthusiasm for fresh sanctions against Russia would be changed much by the end of the Mueller inquiry.\n\nMaria Lipman, a veteran Russian journalist and editor of the Counterpoint journal, agreed.\n\n\"The antagonism between Russia and the U.S. has become so deep that I don't think there can be any improvement. I don't think we should expect any change,\" she said."

Netanyahu and Pompeo, who earlier Thursday made a symbolic visit to the Western Wall in Jerusalem, were about to hold a news conference when Trump tweeted.\n\n\"President Trump has just made history,\" said a clearly pleased Netanyahu when the news conference got underway.\n\n\"I called him. I thanked him on behalf of the people of Israel. He did it again,\" he said, referring to Trump recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and getting rid of the Iran nuclear deal.\n\n\"Now he did something of equal historic importance -- and he did so at a time when Iran is trying to use Syria as a platform to attack Israel,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Business, Trump sought to downplay any connection between the announcement and Israel's election on April 9.\n\n\"No \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t even know about that,\" Trump said. \"Every president has said \u2018do that.\u2019 I\u2019m the one that gets it done.\"\n\nThe president said that the decision had been under consideration for a \"long time.\"\n\n(Abir Sultan/AFP/Getty Images) From left, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, visit the Western Wall Tunnels in Jerusalem's Old City on March 21, 2019.\n\nNetanyahu has repeatedly pressed for the U.S. to recognize Israeli governance in that region. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 six-day Arab-Israeli War.\n\nNetanyahu has since accused Iran of trying to set up a terrorist network from the area.\n\nNext week, Netanyahu will hold a meeting with the president and a private dinner at the White House."

  "text": "The second-largest, second-deadliest Ebola outbreak in history has exceeded 1,000 cases in less than nine months.\n\nA total of 1,009 people have reported symptoms of hemorrhagic fever in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's northeastern provinces of North Kivu and Ituri since \u202aAug. 1.\u202c Among those cases, 944 have tested positive for Ebola, which causes an often-fatal type of hemorrhagic fever, according to Sunday night's bulletin from the country's health ministry.\n\nThe ever-growing outbreak has a case fatality rate of about 60 percent. There have been 629 deaths so far, including 564 people who died from confirmed cases of Ebola. The other deaths are from probable cases.\n\n\"Before being a public health emergency, an Ebola epidemic is above all a human and social tragedy,\" the health minister, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, said in a statement Sunday. \"Behind these numbers are several hundred Congolese families directly affected by the virus and hundreds of orphans.\"\n\n(John Wessels/MSF via AP) Health workers move a patient to a hospital after he was cleared of having Ebola inside of a Medecins Sans Frontieres supported Ebola treatment center in Butembo, Congo, Nov. 4, 2018.\n\nA vast majority of cases have been recorded in the towns of Katwa and Beni in North Kivu province.\n\nSo far, no cases have spread beyond North Kivu and Ituri provinces, nor across international borders. But the risk of national and regional spread remains \"very high,\" according to the World Health Organization.\n\n\"We use words like 'cases' and 'containment' to be scientific, but behind every number is a person, a family and a community that is suffering,\" Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said in a statement Saturday. \"This outbreak has gone on far too long. We owe it to the people of North Kivu to work with them in solidarity not only to end this outbreak as soon as possible, but to build the health systems that address the many other health threats they face on a daily basis.\"\n\n(John Wessels/AFP/Getty Images) Health workers burn medical waste generated during care of patients with the Ebola virus, Aug. 21, 2018, in Mangina, Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nThis is the 10th outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the most severe seen in the Central African nation since 1976, when scientists first identified the virus near the eponymous Ebola River. It's also one of the worst outbreaks, second only to the 2014-2016 plague in multiple West African nations that infected 28,652 people and killed 11,325, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIt's the first Ebola outbreak in history to occur in an active war zone. North Kivu and Ituri, the two provinces where people have been infected, are awash with conflict and insecurity. Health and frontline workers are facing sporadic attacks from armed groups operating near the country's mineral-rich, volatile borderland with Uganda.\n\nResponse teams are also grappling with a highly mobile population and resistance from a local community that has never before seen Ebola.\n\n\"Every member of the community,\" the country's health minister said, \"has a role to play in stopping the spread of the virus.\"\n\n\"The response begins at the level of the mother who brings her sick child to the health center and accepts that a sample is taken for the laboratory,\" he continued. \"It is also based on the head of the family, who accepts that all family members are vaccinated after one of them has been infected with Ebola.\"\n\n(John Wessels/AFP/Getty Images) A military truck for the United Nations Organization and Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) patrols the road linking Beni to Mangina, Aug. 23, 2018, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nSince Aug. 8, more than 96,000 people have been vaccinated against Ebola in the outbreak zone in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, along with health workers in Uganda and South Sudan, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nAt least 321 Ebola patients have recovered, \"but returning home is not always easy,\" the country's health minister said.\n\n\"Already forced to live with the legacy of the disease,\" he added, \"these Ebola survivors also face stigma within their community.\""

  "authors": [],
  "text": "The father of a slain black teenager pleaded for peace Saturday after the acquittal of a white police officer triggered an apparent retaliatory shooting at the defense attorney's office and touched off protests in the streets of Pittsburgh.\n\nPolice put officers on 12-hour shifts until further notice.\n\nThe verdict late Friday in the deadly shooting of 17-year-old Antwon Rose II angered his family and civic leaders and prompted hundreds of people to gather Saturday afternoon at an intersection called Freedom Corner in the Hill District neighborhood, the historic center of black cultural life in Pittsburgh. One man held a sign with the names of black men killed by police around the U.S.\n\n\"It's very painful to see what happened, to sit there and deal with it,\" Rose's father, Antwon Rose Sr., told the crowd. \"I just don't want it to happen to our city no more.\"\n\nAfterward, he told reporters: \"I want peace, period, all the way around. ... Just because there was violence doesn't mean that we counter that with violence.\"\n\nThe mostly white crowd then marched through downtown Pittsburgh and other city neighborhoods, periodically blocking streets as they chanted, \"Who did this? Police did this!\" The protest soon moved onto the University of Pittsburgh campus. Police reported no immediate arrests or injuries.\n\nEarly Saturday, five to eight shots were fired into the building where the officer's attorney, Patrick Thomassey, works, police in nearby Monroeville said. No one was hurt. Police said they had been staking out the place as a precaution, and the gunfire erupted after they left to answer another call around midnight.\n\nFormer East Pittsburgh police Officer Michael Rosfeld had been charged with homicide for shooting Rose as the unarmed teenager ran away from a traffic stop in June. Rosfeld testified that he thought Rose or another suspect had a gun pointed at him and that he fired to protect himself and the community.\n\n\"I hope that man never sleeps at night,\" Rose's mother, Michelle Kenney, said of Rosfeld after the verdict, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \"I hope he gets as much sleep as I do, which is none.\"\n\nRose's family is now pressing ahead with a federal civil rights lawsuit filed against Rosfeld and East Pittsburgh, a small municipality about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from downtown Pittsburgh, where the trial was held.\n\nAttorney S. Lee Merritt, who represents Rose's mother in the litigation, said the verdict was based on Pennsylvania law regarding the use of force that he considers unconstitutional.\n\n\"The protest is an appropriate response to injustice,\" Merritt said, adding that he believes the state law is why jurors reached their verdict of acquittal.\n\nHe also called the shots at Rosfeld's attorney's office \"an act of cowardice and barbarism that does nothing but perpetuate the stereotypes often used to justify police brutality.\"\n\nThomassey told reporters after the verdict that Rosfeld is \"a good man, he is.\" The defense attorney said he hopes the city remains calm and \"everybody takes a deep breath and gets on with their lives.\"\n\nThe leaders of two major Pittsburgh charities issued a statement expressing \"shock and outrage\" over the verdict.\n\n\"Pittsburgh now sadly joins a disturbing and ever-growing catalogue of cases across the United States where law enforcement or security officials have walked free after the killings of young black men under questionable circumstances,\" wrote Maxwell King, president and CEO of the Pittsburgh Foundation, and Grant Oliphant, president of the Heinz Endowments.\n\n\"We have asked the question, 'Would Antwon Rose be alive today if he had been white?' We, his family and African American community leaders believe that more than likely he would be.\"\n\nPittsburgh was in the spotlight less than five months ago, when a gunman ranting about Jews killed 11 people at a synagogue.\n\nRose was riding in an unlicensed taxi that had been involved in a drive-by shooting minutes earlier when Rosfeld pulled the car over and shot the teenager in the back, arm and side of the face. Neither Rose nor another teen in the taxi was holding a weapon when the officer opened fire, though two guns were later found in the vehicle.\n\nRosfeld had worked for the East Pittsburgh Police Department for only a few weeks and was sworn in just hours before the shooting.\n\nThe 12-person jury \u2014 including three black members \u2014 saw video of the fatal confrontation. The jury took less than four hours to reach a verdict.\n\nProsecutor Jonathan Fodi argued that the video showed there was no threat to the officer. But a defense expert testified Rosfeld was within his rights to use deadly force to stop suspects he thought had been involved in a shooting.\n\nThe prosecution did not call its own use-of-force expert, a decision the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania questioned. But Mike Manko, a spokesman for the district attorney's office, said prosecutors were confident they had what they needed to make their case.\n\nShortly before the traffic stop, another person in the taxi, Zaijuan Hester, rolled down a window and shot at two men on the street, hitting one in the abdomen. Hester, 18, pleaded guilty last week to aggravated assault and firearms violations. He said he, not Rose, did the shooting.\n\nProsecutors had charged Rosfeld with an open count of homicide, meaning the jury had the option of convicting him of murder or manslaughter.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press journalists Michael Rubinkam in northeastern Pennsylvania, Ramesh Santanam in Pittsburgh and Keith Srakocic in Pittsburgh contributed to this story.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that shots were fired into the lawyer's building early Saturday, not early Friday."

  "text": "In his first remarks on special counsel Robert Mueller since his report was turned in Friday, President Donald Trump on Monday offered an opinion in sharp contrast to the past two years of insults he's hurled at both the special counsel and his investigation.\n\n\"Do you think Robert Mueller acted honorably?\u201d ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Jon Karl asked the president during an event with Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu. \"Yes, he did,\" Trump responded. Trump has previously described Mueller as \u201cconflicted,\u201d \u201cdisgraced\u201d and a \u201cliar.\u201d\n\nAsked at an Oval Office photo-op a few minutes later if he still believed the investigation was a witch hunt, Trump said it ended the way it should have but went on for far too long. Trump added that no other president should have to face an investigation like it ever again.\n\n\"It's 100 percent the way it should have been. I wish it could have gone a lot sooner, a lot quicker. There are a lot of people out there that have done some very, very evil things, very bad things, I would say treasonous things against our country,\" Trump said. \"Those people will certainly be looked at. I've been looking at them for a long time and I'm saying 'why haven't they been looked at?' Congress, many of them you know who they are. They've done so many evil things,\" Trump said.\n\n\"I will tell you I love this country. I love this country as much as I can anything -- my family, my country, my God, but what they did was a false narrative. It was a terrible thing. We can never let this happen to another president again. I can tell you that. Very few people I know could have handled it. We can never, ever let this happen to another president again.\"\n\nABC News' @jonkarl: \"Mr. President, do you think Robert Mueller acted honorably?\"\n\n\n\nPresident Trump: \"Yes, he did\" https://t.co/jDcFIi8ll8 pic.twitter.com/evrPMdGXfO \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) March 25, 2019\n\nTrump also reiterated his view Attorney General William Barr should decide whether to make the full report becomes public.\n\n\"Up to the attorney general, wouldn't bother me at all,\" Trump said, referring to a public release. Trump also said he isn't thinking about pardoning anyone sentenced during the probe.\n\nThe summary of the report, submitted to Congress Sunday by Barr, said there was no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Mueller did not come to a conclusion on obstruction of justice, according to Barr's summary, so Barr took that on himself, concluding that the evidence Muller found didn't support a charge, although Barr didn't reveal all that Mueller discovered.\n\nCongressional Democrats continue to demand the full report from Mueller.\n\nLast week, the president told reporters at the White House, \"let it come out, let people see it.\"\n\nThe president has claimed \"complete and total exoneration\" from the report, which White House press secretary Sarah Sanders insisted was justified despite Mueller stating, according to Barr, that his not making a decision on the question did not amount to an exoneration on the matter of obstruction.\n\nSanders was asked on NBC Monday morning to acknowledge that it was incorrect to say the report is a full vindication for the president.\n\n\"Not at all. It is,\" she said.\n\n\"It is a complete and total exoneration, and here's why, because the special counsel, they said they couldn't make a decision one way or the other. The way the process works is then they leave that up to the attorney general. The attorney general and the deputy attorney general went through and based their decision on Mueller's investigation. This wasn't based on just their own ideas and their own thinking. It was based on Mueller's investigation,\" Sanders said.\n\n(Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images) Special Counsel Robert Mueller leaves after attending church on March 24, 2019 in Washington, D.C.\n\nCritics, however, rejected Trump's claims of exoneration -- and rejected the notion that Barr was objective in his summary.\n\n\"Given Mr. Barr\u2019s public record of bias against the Special Counsel\u2019s inquiry, he is not a neutral observer and is not in a position to make objective determinations about the report,\" Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement over the weekend.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, criticized Barr's quick turnover of a summary on an investigation that took almost two years and said Barr is likely to be subpoenaed to explain his actions and conclusions.\n\n\"We will ask the attorney general to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. We will demand the release of the full report. The American people are entitled to a full accounting of the president's misconduct referenced by the special counsel,\" Nadler said at a press conference over the weekend in New York district..\n\nIn a tweet over the weekend, Nadler described \"very concerning discrepancies\" within the report and \"final decision making at the Justice Department.\" The report \"did not exonerate the President,\" Nadler tweeted.\n\nFormer U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, said that while the case on collusion \"is closed,\" on the issue of obstruction of justice, \"we're sort of not done.\"\n\n\"It seems to me it was a very close case. Bob Mueller decided not to make a determination about whether or not a charge can be brought, and you only do that if there is substantial evidence of obstruction,\" Bharara said on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" Monday.\n\nWhile it's clear Congress will continue to investigate the questions around obstruction of justice, it remains to be seen whether the president will be receptive to those questions.\n\nAsked on \"Good Morning America\" if the president was prepared to cooperate with any continuing investigations in the House, one of the president's lawyers, Jay Sekulow, said it would be a waste of taxpayer money, listing off all of the evidence Mueller obtained in the probe that lasted the past 22 months.\n\n\u201cI think the reality is that Congress is wasting the taxpayers' money, frankly, and they should be going about legislating and governing rather than continuing this that is a prerogative they have,\u201d Sekulow said. \u201cI think at this point it\u2019s ridiculous to put people through this.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s attorney Jay Sekulow on the Mueller report: \u201dI think the reality is that congress is wasting the tax payers' money.\u201d https://t.co/HUcY9gPmao pic.twitter.com/dqMkc7ZIVn \u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) March 25, 2019\n\nTrump went as far as to call the entire investigation an \"\u201cillegal takedown that failed\" on Sunday. Trump made the claim despite Mueller having been appointed as special counsel by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein after the president's own decision to fire then-FBI Director James Comey, who was leading an investigation into possible Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Trump and congressional Republicans have claimed that there was wrongdoing in the way the investigation was carried out.\n\nCounselor to the president Kellyanne Conway aired those grievances Monday morning, sharing sharp criticism of those who \"let this lie fly for two years, hanging and harrassing and trying to embarass -- and worse -- those of us connected to the 2016 campaign.\" Those critics now owe Trump, his family and the country an apology, Conway said on Fox News.\n\nConway specifically called out Rep. Adam Schiff, a critic of the president and a Democrat who heads the House Intelligence Committee.\n\n\"He ought to resign today,\" Conway said. \"He has been on every TV show 50 times a day for practically the last two years promising Americans that the president would either be impeached or indicted.\"\n\nConway also previewed the way the administration will seek to use the Mueller report in the face of upcoming Congressional investigations, despite almost two years spent escalating attacks on the investigation and Mueller as biased and a witch hunt.\n\n\"Bob Mueller already ran the fair and the full investigation. And any partisan, politicized investigation from here on in will never have the credibility of the Mueller investigation, and the credibility of Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein -- what they have done here,\" Conway said."

Barr has promised to be as transparent as possible, but it's unclear how extensive or detailed Barr's own \"report\" to Congress will be.\n\nIn a letter to the leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary committees, Barr wrote that he intends to \"consult with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Special Counsel Mueller to determine what other information from the report can be released to Congress and the public consistent with the law.\"\n\nA senior Department of Justice official told ABC News on Friday that the report would not include any further indictments.\n\nMueller and his team investigated how far the Kremlin went to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, including trying to determine whether any Americans may have helped those efforts.\n\nAt the heart of Mueller\u2019s probe were two Russian operations: the spread of disinformation on social media, and the release of thousands of sensitive emails stolen by hackers from the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic targets. Mueller\u2019s team has charged 25 Russian nationals and three foreign companies for their alleged role in those operations.\n\nIn appointing a special counsel to investigate, however, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein also directed Mueller to look into \u201callegations\u201d of possible \u201ccoordination\u201d between Russian operatives and associates of President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies have derided the investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d But Rosenstein, FBI Director Chris Wray and Barr have each explicitly disputed that description.\n\nAt least four Trump associates, including Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, have pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents during the Russia-related investigation.\n\nAnother Trump associate, the president\u2019s former attorney Michael Cohen, has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump\u2019s business dealings in Moscow. And former Trump adviser Roger Stone has been charged with lying to Congress about his alleged role in tracking information stolen from Democrats during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n(Leah Millis/Reuters) The Department of Justice building is pictured in Washington D.C., March 21, 2019.\n\nMueller\u2019s investigation grew out of a probe the FBI launched in late July 2016.\n\nBy then, the FBI was already scrutinizing Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort\u2019s business dealings with pro-Russian officials in Ukraine \u2013 dealings that have since landed Manafort in jail. And the FBI was keeping tabs on Trump adviser Carter Page, who was previously targeted for recruitment by Russian spies and had raised eyebrows with a trip to Moscow in mid-July 2016.\n\nBut claims by Trump adviser George Papadopoulos \u2013 that the Russians were touting \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton \u2013 really set off alarms inside the FBI.\n\n\u201cIf any Americans were part of helping the Russians [attack] us, that is a very big deal,\u201d James Comey, who was FBI director at the time, later told lawmakers.\n\nSeveral weeks after formally launching the Russia probe, counterintelligence agents leading the investigation in Washington received a so-called \u201cdossier,\u201d which had been compiled at the behest of Democrats and detailed uncorroborated allegations of coordination between Trump\u2019s campaign and the Kremlin.\n\nSome of the allegations involved Page, who was already on the FBI\u2019s radar, so agents began secretly intercepting his communications. Page has never been charged with any crimes.\n\nThe wide-ranging investigation continued even after Trump took office. After Jeff Sessions became attorney general, he recused himself from oversight of the FBI\u2019s Russia-related probe, citing his previous advocacy for Trump on the campaign trail.\n\nRosenstein subsequently assumed oversight of the investigation.\n\nAnd then Trump shocked the federal law enforcement community: He fired Comey.\n\nThe move prompted Rosenstein to appoint Mueller to take over the whole matter, including a review of whether Comey's firing and other actions meant Trump improperly tried to obstruct the probe.\n\nComey later alleged that in a private meeting with Trump before his removal, the president directed Comey to \u201clet [Flynn] go.\u201d\n\nMueller has not released any evidence suggesting Trump committed a crime related to Russian efforts.\n\nHowever, Mueller did uncover evidence of other possible crimes and referred those cases to other federal prosecutors.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Manhattan ended up tying Trump to federal campaign violations, alleging that \u2013 in the midst of the 2016 presidential campaign \u2013 Trump personally directed Cohen to silence two woman claiming affairs with Trump by making illegal payments to them; Trump has repeatedly denied the affairs.\n\nCohen has pleaded guilty for his role in the matter, but no other charges have been filed.\n\nABC News' Pierre Thomas, John Santucci and Kyra Phillips contributed to this report."

Barr has promised to be as transparent as possible, but it's unclear how extensive or detailed Barr's own \"report\" to Congress will be.\n\nIn a letter to the leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary committees, Barr wrote that he intends to \"consult with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Special Counsel Mueller to determine what other information from the report can be released to Congress and the public consistent with the law.\"\n\nA senior Department of Justice official told ABC News on Friday that the report would not include any further indictments.\n\nMueller and his team investigated how far the Kremlin went to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, including trying to determine whether any Americans may have helped those efforts.\n\nAt the heart of Mueller\u2019s probe were two Russian operations: the spread of disinformation on social media, and the release of thousands of sensitive emails stolen by hackers from the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic targets. Mueller\u2019s team has charged 25 Russian nationals and three foreign companies for their alleged role in those operations.\n\nIn appointing a special counsel to investigate, however, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein also directed Mueller to look into \u201callegations\u201d of possible \u201ccoordination\u201d between Russian operatives and associates of President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies have derided the investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d But Rosenstein, FBI Director Chris Wray and Barr have each explicitly disputed that description.\n\nAt least four Trump associates, including Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, have pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents during the Russia-related investigation.\n\nAnother Trump associate, the president\u2019s former attorney Michael Cohen, has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump\u2019s business dealings in Moscow. And former Trump adviser Roger Stone has been charged with lying to Congress about his alleged role in tracking information stolen from Democrats during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n(Leah Millis/Reuters) The Department of Justice building is pictured in Washington D.C., March 21, 2019.\n\nMueller\u2019s investigation grew out of a probe the FBI launched in late July 2016.\n\nBy then, the FBI was already scrutinizing Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort\u2019s business dealings with pro-Russian officials in Ukraine \u2013 dealings that have since landed Manafort in jail. And the FBI was keeping tabs on Trump adviser Carter Page, who was previously targeted for recruitment by Russian spies and had raised eyebrows with a trip to Moscow in mid-July 2016.\n\nBut claims by Trump adviser George Papadopoulos \u2013 that the Russians were touting \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton \u2013 really set off alarms inside the FBI.\n\n\u201cIf any Americans were part of helping the Russians [attack] us, that is a very big deal,\u201d James Comey, who was FBI director at the time, later told lawmakers.\n\nSeveral weeks after formally launching the Russia probe, counterintelligence agents leading the investigation in Washington received a so-called \u201cdossier,\u201d which had been compiled at the behest of Democrats and detailed uncorroborated allegations of coordination between Trump\u2019s campaign and the Kremlin.\n\nSome of the allegations involved Page, who was already on the FBI\u2019s radar, so agents began secretly intercepting his communications. Page has never been charged with any crimes.\n\nThe wide-ranging investigation continued even after Trump took office. After Jeff Sessions became attorney general, he recused himself from oversight of the FBI\u2019s Russia-related probe, citing his previous advocacy for Trump on the campaign trail.\n\nRosenstein subsequently assumed oversight of the investigation.\n\nAnd then Trump shocked the federal law enforcement community: He fired Comey.\n\nThe move prompted Rosenstein to appoint Mueller to take over the whole matter, including a review of whether Comey's firing and other actions meant Trump improperly tried to obstruct the probe.\n\nComey later alleged that in a private meeting with Trump before his removal, the president directed Comey to \u201clet [Flynn] go.\u201d\n\nMueller has not released any evidence suggesting Trump committed a crime related to Russian efforts.\n\nHowever, Mueller did uncover evidence of other possible crimes and referred those cases to other federal prosecutors.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Manhattan ended up tying Trump to federal campaign violations, alleging that \u2013 in the midst of the 2016 presidential campaign \u2013 Trump personally directed Cohen to silence two woman claiming affairs with Trump by making illegal payments to them; Trump has repeatedly denied the affairs.\n\nCohen has pleaded guilty for his role in the matter, but no other charges have been filed.\n\nABC News' Pierre Thomas, John Santucci and Kyra Phillips contributed to this report."

  "text": "The TAKE with Rick Klein\n\nNo collusion, no obstruction and no prosecution -- that's true to a point, and a significant point at that.\n\nBut despite what President Donald Trump says, there is no exoneration. There is certainly no conclusion to the issues that have consumed much of the Trump presidency, either.\n\nThe questions probed by special counsel Robert Mueller and examined by the Department of Justice have now been kicked over to the political processes that were always going to have to deal with them anyway.\n\nMueller was imbued with unrealistic expectations that he would render final judgments on an immensely complicated series of subjects. He left it to the attorney general to determine whether the president obstructed justice, and Democrats on Capitol Hill will ask questions about that decision.\n\n(Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images) Special Counsel Robert Mueller walks with his wife Ann Mueller after attending church, March 24, 2019, in Washington, D.C.\n\nBeyond that, and beyond the calls for the full Mueller report to be released, the Democratic presidential candidates are largely shrugging off the end of the Mueller era. Most of them have long known he was never going to do the hard work for them.\n\n\"We need to recognize that's not going to change a lot of hearts and minds,\" Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said over the weekend regarding the release of the Mueller report.\n\nThe focus on Mueller will be in large measure about what he didn't find and what he opted not to do.\n\nBut what he did bring to light -- in taking his time, in submitting his findings and in drawing out presidential actions along the way -- will be quite enough for the political system to digest for a long while.\n\nThe RUNDOWN with John Verhovek\n\nWhile the key findings of Mueller's report have been made public, Democrats vying for the party's presidential nomination are still preaching transparency. And as they prepare to campaign in the post-Mueller era, they are beginning to search for an effective messaging strategy that can no longer rely on the uncertainty surrounding the famed prosecutor's findings.\n\n\"It is not often that I agree with Richard Nixon, but he was right to say that the American people have a right to know whether or not their president is a crook.\" Sen.

The people have a right to know what's in that report,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders said over the weekend during a swing through California.\n\nBut in a sign that they have known for some time that their hopes of beating Trump in 2020 could never depend on the contents of Mueller's report, most Democratic presidential hopefuls -- Gillibrand and Sanders included -- are instead focused on pitching policies and honing a message of an America that could move on from the partisan bickering and rancor that has defined the last two years.\n\n\"I am not running for president because of who I'm fighting against, I'm running for president because of who I'm fighting for,\" Gillibrand said Sunday.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has been running a policy-centric campaign, while former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke is pitching himself as a unifying figure that could transcend the nastiness of today's political discourse.\n\nWhatever Mueller's full report does reveal, the tone of these Democratic contenders indicates that their strategy for victory in 2020 is not just to offer an anti-Trump argument, but to articulate a clear vision of the type of change they want to see in this country.\n\nThe TIP with Samantha Sergi\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates flocked to South Carolina in an attempt to court the black vote, but there were actually very few black voters at four events ABC News covered this weekend.\n\nNoticeably, O'Rourke and Buttigeig lacked diversity among the crowds they drew on Friday and Saturday in Columbia and Rock Hill, South Carolina.

Lindsey Graham is accompanied by Israeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman as they visit the border line between Syria and the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights on March 11, 2019.\n\nThe unexpected announcement comes just days before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits the White House on Monday and speaks at the pro-Israel AIPAC conference in Washington.\n\nWithin minutes, Netanyahu tweeted \"Thank You President Trump!\"\n\nAt a time when Iran seeks to use Syria as a platform to destroy Israel, President Trump boldly recognizes Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.

Netanyahu and Pompeo, who earlier Thursday made a symbolic visit to the Western Wall in Jerusalem, were about to hold a news conference when Trump tweeted.\n\n\"President Trump has just made history,\" said a clearly pleased Netanyahu when the news conference got underway.\n\n\"I called him. I thanked him on behalf of the people of Israel. He did it again,\" he said, referring to Trump recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and getting rid of the Iran nuclear deal.\n\n\"Now he did something of equal historic importance -- and he did so at a time when Iran is trying to use Syria as a platform to attack Israel,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Business, Trump sought to downplay any connection between the announcement and Israel's election on April 9.\n\n\"No \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t even know about that,\" Trump said. \"Every president has said \u2018do that.\u2019 I\u2019m the one that gets it done.\"\n\nThe president said that the decision had been under consideration for a \"long time.\"\n\n(Abir Sultan/AFP/Getty Images) From left, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, visit the Western Wall Tunnels in Jerusalem's Old City on March 21, 2019.\n\nNetanyahu has repeatedly pressed for the U.S. to recognize Israeli governance in that region. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 six-day Arab-Israeli War.\n\nNetanyahu has since accused Iran of trying to set up a terrorist network from the area.\n\nNext week, Netanyahu will hold a meeting with the president and a private dinner at the White House."

  "text": "The TAKE with Rick Klein\n\nNo collusion, no obstruction and no prosecution -- that's true to a point, and a significant point at that.\n\nBut despite what President Donald Trump says, there is no exoneration. There is certainly no conclusion to the issues that have consumed much of the Trump presidency, either.\n\nThe questions probed by special counsel Robert Mueller and examined by the Department of Justice have now been kicked over to the political processes that were always going to have to deal with them anyway.\n\nMueller was imbued with unrealistic expectations that he would render final judgments on an immensely complicated series of subjects. He left it to the attorney general to determine whether the president obstructed justice, and Democrats on Capitol Hill will ask questions about that decision.\n\n(Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images) Special Counsel Robert Mueller walks with his wife Ann Mueller after attending church, March 24, 2019, in Washington, D.C.\n\nBeyond that, and beyond the calls for the full Mueller report to be released, the Democratic presidential candidates are largely shrugging off the end of the Mueller era. Most of them have long known he was never going to do the hard work for them.\n\n\"We need to recognize that's not going to change a lot of hearts and minds,\" Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said over the weekend regarding the release of the Mueller report.\n\nThe focus on Mueller will be in large measure about what he didn't find and what he opted not to do.\n\nBut what he did bring to light -- in taking his time, in submitting his findings and in drawing out presidential actions along the way -- will be quite enough for the political system to digest for a long while.\n\nThe RUNDOWN with John Verhovek\n\nWhile the key findings of Mueller's report have been made public, Democrats vying for the party's presidential nomination are still preaching transparency. And as they prepare to campaign in the post-Mueller era, they are beginning to search for an effective messaging strategy that can no longer rely on the uncertainty surrounding the famed prosecutor's findings.\n\n\"It is not often that I agree with Richard Nixon, but he was right to say that the American people have a right to know whether or not their president is a crook.\" Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., said Sunday during her official campaign launch speech standing in front of the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York City.\n\n(Kena Betancur/Getty Images) Democratic presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand speaks during a rally in front of Trump International Hotel & Tower, March 24, 2019, in New York.\n\n\"Nobody, including the president of the United States, is above the law. The people have a right to know what's in that report,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders said over the weekend during a swing through California.\n\nBut in a sign that they have known for some time that their hopes of beating Trump in 2020 could never depend on the contents of Mueller's report, most Democratic presidential hopefuls -- Gillibrand and Sanders included -- are instead focused on pitching policies and honing a message of an America that could move on from the partisan bickering and rancor that has defined the last two years.\n\n\"I am not running for president because of who I'm fighting against, I'm running for president because of who I'm fighting for,\" Gillibrand said Sunday.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has been running a policy-centric campaign, while former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke is pitching himself as a unifying figure that could transcend the nastiness of today's political discourse.\n\nWhatever Mueller's full report does reveal, the tone of these Democratic contenders indicates that their strategy for victory in 2020 is not just to offer an anti-Trump argument, but to articulate a clear vision of the type of change they want to see in this country.\n\nThe TIP with Samantha Sergi\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates flocked to South Carolina in an attempt to court the black vote, but there were actually very few black voters at four events ABC News covered this weekend.\n\nNoticeably, O'Rourke and Buttigeig lacked diversity among the crowds they drew on Friday and Saturday in Columbia and Rock Hill, South Carolina. Both cities are made up of roughly 47 percent of people of color.\n\n(Richard Ellis/ZUMA Press) Beto O'Rourke addresses supporters during a campaign stop at Tradesman Brewing Company, March 22, 2019, in Charleston, S.C.\n\nAt a meet-and-greet event with O'Rourke on the University of South Carolina's campus in Columbia, five young, black women left 13 minutes into his speech when he was talking about the mass incarceration of black men.\n\nCompared to Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and O'Rourke, Buttigeig drew the largest overall crowd during a Q&A session in the gymnasium of Clinton College, a historically black college in Rock Hill, South Carolina. While the crowd was large, there were only a handful of people of color in attendance.\n\nTHE PLAYLIST\n\nABC News' \"Start Here\" podcast.

Scott Applewhite/AP, FILE) House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff speaks with reporters after his panel voted in a closed session to send more than 50 interview transcripts from its now-closed Russia investigation to special counsel Robert Mueller, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Feb. 6, 2019.\n\nNadler, in a statement with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, said it was \"unacceptable that, after Special Counsel Mueller spent 22 months meticulously uncovering this evidence, Attorney General Barr made a decision not to charge the President in under 48 hours,\" and did so without interviewing Trump."

  "text": "So this is what Tim Cook does with $1 billion.\n\nThat's the amount that Apple has invested in developing its entertainment division, including original programming in the company's closest approximation of a Hollywood studio to date. The company is expected to reveal its lineup of shows and movies, in addition to how to stream them at its \"show time\" event Monday in San Francisco.\n\n(Michael Short/Getty Images) Roger Rosner, vice president of applications at Apple Inc., speaks during the launch of their new video streaming service, and unveiled a premium subscription tier to its News app, March 25, 2019, in Cupertino, Calif.\n\nThe event starts at 1 p.m. ET and can be streamed here.\n\nIt's show time. Tune in March 25th at 10 a.m. PT to watch our #AppleEvent live on Twitter.\n\n\n\nTap \u2764\ufe0f below to get updates from @Apple pic.twitter.com/b6qno83rqS \u2014 Apple (@Apple) March 20, 2019\n\nThe event is a pivotal moment for the company, which is rebranding itself as a services company amid a saturated iPhone market. As is typical with Apple events, it's shrouded in secrecy with a few strategic leaks. But this is what we we're hearing so far:\n\nApple streaming video\n\nIt's expected that Apple will shift its video content to the Apple TV app that comes pre-installed on its devices. Insider tech sites also assume it will operate like the Amazon Prime setup, which offers both other streaming services apps as well as its own channel.\n\n\"Apple plans on making a new storefront that's much more prominent for those who use Apple TV boxes and other Apple hardware. It will also be able to offer its own bundles -- for instance, it could offer a package of HBO, Showtime and Starz at a price that's lower than you'd pay for each pay TV service on its own,\" according to Recode.\n\nIt will not include Hulu or Netflix, according to several reports. The pricing is anyone's guess.\n\nIn June 2017, Apple created Hollywood buzz when it hired Sony presidents Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg to head its original programming division. It has since poached more execs from Sony. However, its first two attempts at original programming -- \"Planet of the Apps,\" an entrepreneur reality show similar to \"Shark Tank,\" and \"Carpool Karaoke: The Series\" with James Corden -- fell short of, say, AMC's \"Mad Men\" as a calling card for original programming.\n\nTo compete with Netflix or Amazon Prime, Apple has spent heavily on recruiting talent ranging from marquee names -- Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, J.J. Abrams and Brie Larson -- to more niche personalities -- Josh Gad and Alan Yang. Of course, it remains under wraps whether any of these stars will be at the event, but it seems likely there will be at least a few.\n\nThe talent and format look to be more diverse than network TV, featuring scripted and unscripted shows, as well as a focus on audio storytelling, which fits into Apple's established foray into music and podcasts. It also heavily leans on women and minorities in talent both in front of and behind the camera. There's an immigrant-focused show called \"Little America,\" from Lee Eisenberg (\"The Office\") and Alan Yang (\"Master of None\"), and \"Pachinko,\" which is based on Min Jin Lee's novel about generations of a Korean family living through Japanese occupation.\n\nApple News\n\nApple News Plus, launched on Monday, is a subscription within Apple News, and will provide subscriptions to over 300 magazine subscriptions, along with subscriptions to the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal. \u201cApple News Plus is the only place that you will find all these magazines in a single package,\u201d said Roger Rosner, Apple\u2019s vice president of applications.\n\nThe company touted the design of Apple News Plus, and how it would showcase the pictures and text of magazines on both the iPhone and the iPad. Along with being able to read full magazine issues, articles will be curated by Apple News editors.\n\nIt was reported that The New York Times and The Washington Post (owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos) would not be participating in Apple News Plus. A subscription to Apple News Plus will cost $9.99 per month. It will be launching in Europe and Australia later this year.\n\nMark Thompson, CEO of The New York Times told Reuters, \"We tend to be quite leery about the idea of almost habituating people to find our journalism somewhere else. We're also generically worried about our journalism being scrambled in a kind of Magimix [blender] with everyone else's journalism.\"\n\nApple Credit Card\n\nApple currently offers a Barclaycard Visa, but it unveiled a Goldman Sachs credit card at the event. The Apple Card, connected to the Wallet app, and can be used anywhere that accepts Apple Pay.\n\nInstead of a \u201cpoints\u201d system, the card provides \u201cdaily cash.\u201d Using the card on your phone will give 2 percent back on purchases, and 3 percent back on purchase from Apple.\n\nThe company said the card will have no late fees, no annual fees and no international fees."

There have been 629 deaths so far, including 564 people who died from confirmed cases of Ebola. The other deaths are from probable cases.\n\n\"Before being a public health emergency, an Ebola epidemic is above all a human and social tragedy,\" the health minister, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, said in a statement Sunday. \"Behind these numbers are several hundred Congolese families directly affected by the virus and hundreds of orphans.\"\n\n(John Wessels/MSF via AP) Health workers move a patient to a hospital after he was cleared of having Ebola inside of a Medecins Sans Frontieres supported Ebola treatment center in Butembo, Congo, Nov. 4, 2018.\n\nA vast majority of cases have been recorded in the towns of Katwa and Beni in North Kivu province.\n\nSo far, no cases have spread beyond North Kivu and Ituri provinces, nor across international borders. But the risk of national and regional spread remains \"very high,\" according to the World Health Organization.\n\n\"We use words like 'cases' and 'containment' to be scientific, but behind every number is a person, a family and a community that is suffering,\" Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said in a statement Saturday. \"This outbreak has gone on far too long. We owe it to the people of North Kivu to work with them in solidarity not only to end this outbreak as soon as possible, but to build the health systems that address the many other health threats they face on a daily basis.\"\n\n(John Wessels/AFP/Getty Images) Health workers burn medical waste generated during care of patients with the Ebola virus, Aug. 21, 2018, in Mangina, Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nThis is the 10th outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the most severe seen in the Central African nation since 1976, when scientists first identified the virus near the eponymous Ebola River. It's also one of the worst outbreaks, second only to the 2014-2016 plague in multiple West African nations that infected 28,652 people and killed 11,325, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIt's the first Ebola outbreak in history to occur in an active war zone. North Kivu and Ituri, the two provinces where people have been infected, are awash with conflict and insecurity. Health and frontline workers are facing sporadic attacks from armed groups operating near the country's mineral-rich, volatile borderland with Uganda.\n\nResponse teams are also grappling with a highly mobile population and resistance from a local community that has never before seen Ebola.\n\n\"Every member of the community,\" the country's health minister said, \"has a role to play in stopping the spread of the virus.\"\n\n\"The response begins at the level of the mother who brings her sick child to the health center and accepts that a sample is taken for the laboratory,\" he continued. \"It is also based on the head of the family, who accepts that all family members are vaccinated after one of them has been infected with Ebola.\"\n\n(John Wessels/AFP/Getty Images) A military truck for the United Nations Organization and Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) patrols the road linking Beni to Mangina, Aug. 23, 2018, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nSince Aug. 8, more than 96,000 people have been vaccinated against Ebola in the outbreak zone in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, along with health workers in Uganda and South Sudan, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nAt least 321 Ebola patients have recovered, \"but returning home is not always easy,\" the country's health minister said.\n\n\"Already forced to live with the legacy of the disease,\" he added, \"these Ebola survivors also face stigma within their community.\""

  "text": "With the election in Israel a little more than two weeks away, President Donald Trump on Monday gave what many are calling a political gift to his close friend Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu -- vying for his fifth term: a high-profile visit to the White House.\n\nNetanyahu's red carpet welcome comes just days after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Netanyahu in Israel and the president made a surprise announcement that the U.S. would recognize Israel\u2019s sovereignty over the disputed Golan Heights, an issue the administration had been mulling for weeks at the urging of the Israeli prime minister.\n\n\"This is truly an historic day,\" Netanyahu said as Trump looked on for a signing ceremony to make the U.S. recognition official. \"Thank you, President Trump,\" he said.\n\n\"Israel won the Golan Heights in a historic fight of self-defense,\" Netanyahu said, referring to Israel capturing the strategic high ground fro Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.\n\n\"This is a long time in the making. Should have taken place many decades ago,\" Trump said, as he signed the proclamation.\n\nTrump and Netanyahu have been dubbed by some as political \"twins\" on the global stage given the parallels between their leadership styles, their close strategic coordination and personal friendship, as both have been hampered by lingering investigations into potential misconduct.\n\nNetanyahu has embraced his close relations with Trump throughout his re-election bid, with many of his political billboards featuring photos of them together.\n\nThis latest series of goodwill gestures from the Trump administration toward Israel in the closing days of the campaign amounted to what some scholars characterize as \"blatant\" meddling in Israeli domestic politics.\n\n\"We\u2019ve interceded in other Israeli elections but not with this sort of brazenness,\" said Aaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center.\n\n\"Every U.S. president has had either a confrontational or friendly relationship with the Israeli prime minister, and that\u2019s largely been shaped by their positions on the Palestinian issue, but no previous president has ever so blatantly interfered to help an Israeli prime minister this way,\" said Haim Malka, deputy director and senior fellow of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n(Evan Vucci/AP, FILE) President Donald Trump meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office of the White House on March 5, 2018, in Washington, D.C.\n\nFor Netanyahu, who's facing his toughest re-election bid yet under a cloud of investigation, Malka says a trip to Washington gives him the opportunity to \"show the voters back in Israeli that he still has the strong backing of the U.S. despite his own troubles back at home.\"\n\nMiller recalled three circumstances in recent history when U.S. presidents have sought to influence the outcome of an Israeli election, including one other occasion when President Bill Clinton invited then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres to the White House a month before an election that he ultimately lost to Netanyahu. But, Miller concluded, Trump's combination of actions represent \"clearly the most blatant attempt\" of interference.\n\nOn the flip side, there have also been cases when U.S. presidents have actively sought to deny Netanyahu the appearance of cooperation with Washington. Back in 2015, President Barack Obama turned down a meeting with Netanyahu, citing the proximity of his trip to the Israeli elections.\n\n\"As a matter of long-standing practice and principle, we do not see heads of state or candidates in close proximity to their elections, so as to avoid the appearance of influencing a democratic election in a foreign country,\" Obama's National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said at the time. \"Accordingly, the president will not be meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu because of the proximity to the Israeli election, which is just two weeks after his planned address to the U.S. Congress.\"\n\nTrump has denied that he's motivated to help Netanyahu politically. Asked specifically about whether his Golan Heights announcement was related to Netanyahu's upcoming election, Trump denied it.\n\n\"No, I wouldn\u2019t even know about that. I wouldn't even know about that, I have no idea. I hear he's doing OK,\" Trump said. \"I don't know if he's doing great right now, but I hear he's doing OK. But I would imagine the other side, whoever is against him is also in favor of what I just did.\"\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s actions are interpreted by some observers as an intervention in Israeli domestic politics, Malka points out that it\u2019s also a domestic policy play for Trump.\n\n\"This is consistent with Trump policy toward Israel in terms of his recognition of Jerusalem as the capital and moving the embassy,\" Malka said, \"so this helps him domestically paint a picture that the GOP is more pro-Israel than the Democrats.\""

  "text": "Special counsel Robert Mueller's report into the Kremlin's interference in the 2016 presidential election did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia, according to a letter to Congress from Attorney General William Barr.\n\nThe letter describes \"two main\" Russian efforts to influence the election including \u201cattempts by a Russian organization\u2026 to conduct disinformation and social media operations in the United States\u201d and \u201cthe Russian government\u2019s efforts to conduct computer hacking operations\u201d targeting former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic Party.\n\nIn both circumstances, the \u201cSpecial Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts.\u201d\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s office made no conclusion on the matter of possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump.\n\n\"The Special Counsel, therefore, did not draw a conclusion \u2013 one way or the other \u2013 as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction,\" the letter read. \"Instead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out 'difficult issues' of law and fact concerning whether the President's actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction.\"\n\nIn his communique to lawmakers, Barr underscored that the special counsel states that \u201cwhile this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\u201d\n\n(Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images) Special Counsel Robert Mueller, March 24, 2019, in Washington, D.C. Special counsel Robert Mueller has delivered his report on alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election to Attorney General William Barr.\n\nWhile Mueller\u2019s report did not reach a conclusion as to whether obstruction of justice occurred, Attorney General Barr\u2019s letter said he determined a case for obstruction was not warranted.\n\n\u201cIn cataloging the President\u2019s actions many of which took place in public view, the report identities no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent, each of which, under the Department's principles of federal prosecution guiding charging decisions, would need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish an obstruction-of-justice offense.\"\n\nBarr said his intent is to release as much as possible but there are grand jury secrecy concerns with some portions.\n\nThe White House celebrated the news, with President Donald Trump hailing the report on Twitter and, later in comments to reporters, as an \"exoneration.\"\n\n\"This was an illegal takedown that failed and hopefully, someone is going to be looking at the other side,\" Trump told reporters on Sunday.\n\nHe tweeted: \"No Collusion, No Obstruction, Complete and Total EXONERATION. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!\"\n\nNo Collusion, No Obstruction, Complete and Total EXONERATION. KEEP AMERICA GREAT! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 24, 2019\n\n\"The Special Counsel did not find any collusion and did not find any obstruction,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. \"Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein further determined there was no obstruction. The findings of the Department of Justice are a total and complete exoneration of the President of the United States.\u201d\n\nJay Sekulow, one of President Trump\u2019s lawyers, told ABC News chief anchor George Stephanopoulos that the report was a \"complete win for the president and the American people.\"\n\n\"Not just a win.\" Sekulow said. \"The entire basis upon which this inquiry was instituted was a concern over collusion between the Russian government and the trump campaign, Bob Mueller and the Department of Justice could not be clearer. To have the obstruction issue even as a viable one, which it was not, there would have to be an underlying crime, which there wasn't.\"\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., questioned the timing of the letter tweeting \"Special Counsel Mueller worked for 22 months to determine the extent to which President Trump obstructed justice. Attorney General Barr took 2 days to tell the American people that while the President is not exonerated, there will be no action by DOJ.\" He later tweeted that \"in light of the very concerning discrepancies and final decision making at the Justice Department following the Special Counsel report,\" the House Judiciary Committee will be calling Barr in to testify in the near future.\n\nIn his letter to members of Congress on Sunday, Barr described the breadth of the special counsel\u2019s extensive and exhaustive probe. Mueller\u2019s 19 prosecutors and 40 FBI agents issued more than 2,800 subpoenas, executed nearly 500 search warrants, and interviewed approximately 500 witnesses, Barr wrote, the results of which amounted to 37 indictments and six guilty pleas to date.\n\nThe news comes amid Democrats continued calls for the full release of the findings.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in a joint letter, seemed to sum up the sentiment of many congressional Democrats in saying that Barr's letter \"raises as many questions as it answers\" and that Congress \"requires the full report and the underlying documents.\"\n\n\"The fact that Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s report does not exonerate the president on a charge as serious as obstruction of justice demonstrates how urgent it is that the full report and underlying documentation be made public without any further delay,\" they wrote. \"Given Mr. Barr\u2019s public record of bias against the Special Counsel\u2019s inquiry, he is not a neutral observer and is not in a position to make objective determinations about the report.\"\n\nThe congressional leaders also took issues with the president's claims of being \"exonerated.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail and on the Hill, Democrats made clear they are going to want every detail and document about the investigation and some have said they are willing to use their subpoena power in order to get it.\n\n\"It means make the request, if the request is denied subpoena, if the subpoenas are denied we will hold people before the Congress and yes, we will prosecute in court as necessary to get this information,\" House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Sunday on \"This Week\".\n\nDemocratic candidates running to unseat President Donald Trump in 2020 reacted quickly to the news that Mueller delivered his report to DOJ with one consistent message: Make it public.\n\n\"The Mueller report must be made public \u2014 all of it,\" Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-NY said in a presidential campaign speech outside the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York City.\n\n\"The Mueller report must be made public \u2014 all of it,\" Sen.

Barr has promised to be as transparent as possible, but it's unclear how extensive or detailed Barr's own \"report\" to Congress will be.\n\nIn a letter to the leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary committees, Barr wrote that he intends to \"consult with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Special Counsel Mueller to determine what other information from the report can be released to Congress and the public consistent with the law.\"\n\nA senior Department of Justice official told ABC News on Friday that the report would not include any further indictments.\n\nMueller and his team investigated how far the Kremlin went to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, including trying to determine whether any Americans may have helped those efforts.\n\nAt the heart of Mueller\u2019s probe were two Russian operations: the spread of disinformation on social media, and the release of thousands of sensitive emails stolen by hackers from the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic targets. Mueller\u2019s team has charged 25 Russian nationals and three foreign companies for their alleged role in those operations.\n\nIn appointing a special counsel to investigate, however, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein also directed Mueller to look into \u201callegations\u201d of possible \u201ccoordination\u201d between Russian operatives and associates of President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies have derided the investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d But Rosenstein, FBI Director Chris Wray and Barr have each explicitly disputed that description.\n\nAt least four Trump associates, including Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, have pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents during the Russia-related investigation.\n\nAnother Trump associate, the president\u2019s former attorney Michael Cohen, has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump\u2019s business dealings in Moscow. And former Trump adviser Roger Stone has been charged with lying to Congress about his alleged role in tracking information stolen from Democrats during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n(Leah Millis/Reuters) The Department of Justice building is pictured in Washington D.C., March 21, 2019.\n\nMueller\u2019s investigation grew out of a probe the FBI launched in late July 2016.\n\nBy then, the FBI was already scrutinizing Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort\u2019s business dealings with pro-Russian officials in Ukraine \u2013 dealings that have since landed Manafort in jail. And the FBI was keeping tabs on Trump adviser Carter Page, who was previously targeted for recruitment by Russian spies and had raised eyebrows with a trip to Moscow in mid-July 2016.\n\nBut claims by Trump adviser George Papadopoulos \u2013 that the Russians were touting \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton \u2013 really set off alarms inside the FBI.\n\n\u201cIf any Americans were part of helping the Russians [attack] us, that is a very big deal,\u201d James Comey, who was FBI director at the time, later told lawmakers.\n\nSeveral weeks after formally launching the Russia probe, counterintelligence agents leading the investigation in Washington received a so-called \u201cdossier,\u201d which had been compiled at the behest of Democrats and detailed uncorroborated allegations of coordination between Trump\u2019s campaign and the Kremlin.\n\nSome of the allegations involved Page, who was already on the FBI\u2019s radar, so agents began secretly intercepting his communications. Page has never been charged with any crimes.\n\nThe wide-ranging investigation continued even after Trump took office. After Jeff Sessions became attorney general, he recused himself from oversight of the FBI\u2019s Russia-related probe, citing his previous advocacy for Trump on the campaign trail.\n\nRosenstein subsequently assumed oversight of the investigation.\n\nAnd then Trump shocked the federal law enforcement community: He fired Comey.\n\nThe move prompted Rosenstein to appoint Mueller to take over the whole matter, including a review of whether Comey's firing and other actions meant Trump improperly tried to obstruct the probe.\n\nComey later alleged that in a private meeting with Trump before his removal, the president directed Comey to \u201clet [Flynn] go.\u201d\n\nMueller has not released any evidence suggesting Trump committed a crime related to Russian efforts.\n\nHowever, Mueller did uncover evidence of other possible crimes and referred those cases to other federal prosecutors.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Manhattan ended up tying Trump to federal campaign violations, alleging that \u2013 in the midst of the 2016 presidential campaign \u2013 Trump personally directed Cohen to silence two woman claiming affairs with Trump by making illegal payments to them; Trump has repeatedly denied the affairs.\n\nCohen has pleaded guilty for his role in the matter, but no other charges have been filed.\n\nABC News' Pierre Thomas, John Santucci and Kyra Phillips contributed to this report."

  "text": "Two of the nation\u2019s most prominent health organizations issued a joint policy statement on Monday endorsing widespread public health regulations to help reduce the amount of sugary drinks that kids consume.\n\nThe statement, issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American Heart Association (AHA), will be published in the April issue of Pediatrics. It calls for additional taxes across the country on sugary beverages and limits on marketing of these drinks to children, as well as making drinks like water and milk the default beverages on children\u2019s menu and ensuring access to healthy foods through federal nutrition assistance programs.\n\n\u201cAs a nation we have to say \u2018no\u2019 to the onslaught of marketing of sugary drinks to our children,\u201d said Rachel K. Johnson, professor emeritus of nutrition at the University of Vermont and former chair of the AHA\u2019s nutrition committee, in a statement. \u201cWe know what works to protect kids\u2019 health and it\u2019s time we put effective policies in place that bring down rates of sugary drink consumption just like we\u2019ve done with tobacco.\u201d\n\nWhy are sugary drinks bad?\n\nChildhood obesity rates have more than tripled since the 1970s, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and sugary drinks are one of the many factors that have contributed to this rise. Other factors include a lack of physical activity, poor sleep routines, and the overall consumption of higher-calorie, low-nutrition foods.\n\nSugary beverages are any drinks that contain added sugar. That includes not only most sodas, but fruit drinks, sports drinks, energy drinks, sweetened waters and coffee and tea beverages. There are also many different names for added sugar that might not immediately be apparent but show up on food labels, such as corn syrup, sucrose, and dextrose.\n\nJuices can also be made with added sugars on top of the natural sugars already present in the fruits. They should not be given to kids under a year old and given in limited quantities to toddlers, according to the AAP. Instead of juice, consider eating whole fruits for their maximum nutritional value with fiber.\n\n\u201cFor children, the biggest source of added sugars often is not what they eat, it\u2019s what they drink,\u201d Dr. Natalie D. Muth, a pediatrician and lead author of the policy statement, told ABC News.\n\nMuth said that on average, children consume over 30 gallons of sugary drinks each year -- that's a bathtub full of sugar -- and that 17 percent of kids are getting their daily recommended amount of calories from sugary drinks rather than nutrient-dense foods.\n\n\u201cAs a pediatrician, I am concerned that these sweetened drinks pose real \u2014 and preventable \u2014 risks to our children\u2019s health, including tooth decay, diabetes, obesity and heart disease,\u201d Muth said.\n\n(STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images)\n\nIn a statement from the American Beverage Association (ABA), the trade group that represents the large non-alcoholic beverage companies, a spokesman told ABC News that \u201cwhile soda consumption has declined by a third, the obesity rates have increased by a quarter, so if obesity was solely related to soda, it should\u2019ve also gone down if they were directly correlated.\u201d\n\nWill these recommendations make a difference?\n\nOne of the AHA and AAP\u2019s strongest recommendations is to introduce taxes on drinks with high sugar content, a move that has already shown success in several cities across the U.S. and other countries.\n\nBerkeley, California, for example, was the first U.S. city to pass a tax on sugary drinks, which went into effect in 2015. In the two years after the tax went into effect, a study found that consumption of sugary drinks fell by 52 percent while water consumption rose by 29 percent. By comparison, there were no significant changes in sugary beverage consumption in San Francisco or Oakland, the two cities closest to Berkeley.\n\nIn other areas of public health, such as alcohol abuse and cigarette smoking, the implementation of higher taxes has also led to reductions in their use.\n\nMuth said that the taxes would, in part, go back to the communities being taxed to help improve health. In Philadelphia, for example, she said that the money generated from a soda tax goes to pre-K programs in neighborhoods where people are most likely to buy sugary drinks. Incidentally, these neighborhoods also tend to be ones with lower socioeconomic status, which also tend to be the ones disproportionately targeted in ads for unhealthy foods and drinks.\n\nIn their statement, the ABA spokesman said that instead of additional taxes and regulations, \u201ca better way to help reduce the amount of sugar consumers get from beverages...includes putting parents in the driver\u2019s seat to decide what\u2019s best for their children.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are supporting parents who want less sugar in their kids\u2019 diets by creating more drinks than ever before with less or no sugar, as well as smaller portion sizes, and by backing efforts to make water, milk or 100 percent juice the default beverages restaurants serve with children\u2019s meals,\u201d the spokesman continued, adding that it is working to reduce beverage calories consumed by 20 percent by 2025.\n\nThe guidelines released Monday are not waiting for the future, though. The AHA and AAP want parents to talk to their kids about healthy drink options and encourage them to drink only milk and water without drinks high in sugar as part of their diets. It\u2019s important to teach kids how to read labels so that they can take initiative with their health.\n\nWhat can parents do?\n\nMuth recommended three ways parents can help:\n\n\n\n\u00b7 Starting at a young age, make water and milk the only available drinks for your kids. Eliminate sugary drinks at home, if possible, and give kids a fun, refillable water bottle that they can carry with them wherever they go. Parents should be role models by not consuming sugary drinks themselves.\n\n\n\n\u00b7 Teach kids that water and milk are the norm, even when going out to eat.\n\n\n\n\u00b7 Starting at around 7 or 8 years old, kids can start to recognize marketing tactics. Parents should talk to their children about these strategies that companies use to make them buy more drinks.\n\n\n\nJamie Felzer, MD, MPH, is an internal medicine resident from Scripps Clinic in San Diego, California, who is working with the ABC News Medical Unit."

  "authors": [],
  "text": "Lawmakers are poised to vote on making New Jersey the 11th state to legalize recreational marijuana.\n\nThe Democrat-led Assembly and Senate have scheduled votes for Monday.\n\nThe vote, whose outcome remains unclear, comes after more than a year of mostly back-room wrangling since Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy came into office. Murphy campaigned on legalization, in contrast with his predecessor, Republican Chris Christie.\n\nNew Jersey would join the District of Columbia and 10 other states with legalized recreational use of the drug for adults if the vote succeeds.\n\nMurphy supports the legislation and has been calling lawmakers seeking their support, according to his office.\n\nDespite Democratic control of state government, the issue has divided legislators, with even some Democrats who supported the measure in committee saying they weren't committed to a yes vote on the floor.\n\nA closer look at the New Jersey measure:\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BILL?\n\nThe measure would allow for the sale and personal use of up to an ounce of marijuana for people 21 and over. The drug would be taxed at $42 an ounce, with the ability for towns that host growers, processors, wholesalers or retailers to charge an additional tax of up to 3 percent in some cases.\n\nThe measure calls for setting up a five-person cannabis regulatory commission, which would set the ground rules and oversee marijuana regulation in New Jersey.\n\nThe governor would name three of the five full-time members, who would serve for five-year terms. The Assembly speaker and Senate president would name the other two members.\n\nThe proposal also calls for expungement of pending charges and prior marijuana-related convictions. Under the proposal, New Jersey would allow for the expungement of marijuana crimes for possession up to 5 pounds. Lawmakers acknowledge it sounds like a lot but say it's necessary in order to allow for an expedited expungement process, since the statute covering possession for small amounts of cannabis goes up to 5 pounds.\n\nThe measure also aims to incentivize women and minorities to participate in the legal marijuana market by requiring 30 percent of licenses go to these groups.\n\nThe bill also calls for an investigation on the influence of cannabis on driving and calls for funding drug-recognition experts for law enforcement.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWHEN COULD YOU START USING RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA?\n\nThe bill says that it would be legal to possess up to an ounce as soon as the bill is enacted, but it would be longer until the legal marketplace is set up.\n\nMedical marijuana facilities would be cleared to begin offering recreational cannabis soon after the bill passes but are required to keep enough product to serve patients first.\n\nIt could be about six months retail locations open since the commission would have to set guidelines.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHOW DOES NEW JERSEY'S TAX COMPARE TO OTHER STATES'?\n\nLawmakers are proposing the $42 per-ounce tax, with towns permitted to tax more, up to 3 percent in the case of retailers.\n\nMost states with recreational marijuana levy an excise tax as a percentage, though Alaska also levies a per-ounce tax, which is set at $50, according to a survey of tax rates by the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation.\n\nNew Jersey's lawmakers have said they're pursuing the flat rate as a way to guard against revenue fluctuations if the market price changes.\n\nMedical marijuana in New Jersey is currently subjected to the state's 6.625 percent sales tax, but that's being phased out by 2024 under the pending legislation."

Barr has promised to be as transparent as possible, but it's unclear how extensive or detailed Barr's own \"report\" to Congress will be.\n\nIn a letter to the leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary committees, Barr wrote that he intends to \"consult with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Special Counsel Mueller to determine what other information from the report can be released to Congress and the public consistent with the law.\"\n\nA senior Department of Justice official told ABC News on Friday that the report would not include any further indictments.\n\nMueller and his team investigated how far the Kremlin went to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, including trying to determine whether any Americans may have helped those efforts.\n\nAt the heart of Mueller\u2019s probe were two Russian operations: the spread of disinformation on social media, and the release of thousands of sensitive emails stolen by hackers from the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic targets. Mueller\u2019s team has charged 25 Russian nationals and three foreign companies for their alleged role in those operations.\n\nIn appointing a special counsel to investigate, however, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein also directed Mueller to look into \u201callegations\u201d of possible \u201ccoordination\u201d between Russian operatives and associates of President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies have derided the investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d But Rosenstein, FBI Director Chris Wray and Barr have each explicitly disputed that description.\n\nAt least four Trump associates, including Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, have pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents during the Russia-related investigation.\n\nAnother Trump associate, the president\u2019s former attorney Michael Cohen, has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump\u2019s business dealings in Moscow. And former Trump adviser Roger Stone has been charged with lying to Congress about his alleged role in tracking information stolen from Democrats during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n(Leah Millis/Reuters) The Department of Justice building is pictured in Washington D.C., March 21, 2019.\n\nMueller\u2019s investigation grew out of a probe the FBI launched in late July 2016.\n\nBy then, the FBI was already scrutinizing Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort\u2019s business dealings with pro-Russian officials in Ukraine \u2013 dealings that have since landed Manafort in jail. And the FBI was keeping tabs on Trump adviser Carter Page, who was previously targeted for recruitment by Russian spies and had raised eyebrows with a trip to Moscow in mid-July 2016.\n\nBut claims by Trump adviser George Papadopoulos \u2013 that the Russians were touting \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton \u2013 really set off alarms inside the FBI.\n\n\u201cIf any Americans were part of helping the Russians [attack] us, that is a very big deal,\u201d James Comey, who was FBI director at the time, later told lawmakers.\n\nSeveral weeks after formally launching the Russia probe, counterintelligence agents leading the investigation in Washington received a so-called \u201cdossier,\u201d which had been compiled at the behest of Democrats and detailed uncorroborated allegations of coordination between Trump\u2019s campaign and the Kremlin.\n\nSome of the allegations involved Page, who was already on the FBI\u2019s radar, so agents began secretly intercepting his communications. Page has never been charged with any crimes.\n\nThe wide-ranging investigation continued even after Trump took office. After Jeff Sessions became attorney general, he recused himself from oversight of the FBI\u2019s Russia-related probe, citing his previous advocacy for Trump on the campaign trail.\n\nRosenstein subsequently assumed oversight of the investigation.\n\nAnd then Trump shocked the federal law enforcement community: He fired Comey.\n\nThe move prompted Rosenstein to appoint Mueller to take over the whole matter, including a review of whether Comey's firing and other actions meant Trump improperly tried to obstruct the probe.\n\nComey later alleged that in a private meeting with Trump before his removal, the president directed Comey to \u201clet [Flynn] go.\u201d\n\nMueller has not released any evidence suggesting Trump committed a crime related to Russian efforts.\n\nHowever, Mueller did uncover evidence of other possible crimes and referred those cases to other federal prosecutors.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Manhattan ended up tying Trump to federal campaign violations, alleging that \u2013 in the midst of the 2016 presidential campaign \u2013 Trump personally directed Cohen to silence two woman claiming affairs with Trump by making illegal payments to them; Trump has repeatedly denied the affairs.\n\nCohen has pleaded guilty for his role in the matter, but no other charges have been filed.\n\nABC News' Pierre Thomas, John Santucci and Kyra Phillips contributed to this report."

Moore III told The Advocate outside court Thursday that the system for \"matching latent fingerprints changed significantly.\"\n\n\"These prints have been run before with no match, and then run again with no match,\" Moore said, \"and now it's run this time and the system has been a lot better, and so now these prints come back to a different person.\"\n\nThis decision today ... was the right, honest, ethical and, now, factual thing to do.\n\nThe testing of nine prints from the crime scene, which were selected by fingerprint experts based on their viability, led to the identification of a different man -- Stephen Forbes, a man with a history of committing similar assaults in the same neighborhood -- as the attacker.\n\nThe Innocence Project reports that Forbes was arrested in 1986, confessed to four other rapes -- not including the one Williams was convicted for -- and died in prison in 1996.\n\n(WBRZ) Archie Williams had his rape conviction vacated and he was exonerated after spending 36 years behind bars.\n\n\"This decision today ... was the right, honest, ethical and, now, factual thing to do. We believe that this was a wrongful conviction based on technology processes that were in place then; things have truly changed since,\" Moore said in the video shared by The Advocate.\n\nWilliams thanked God for carrying him through, saying, \"I just fought for this moment here; I never gave up because he wouldn't let me give up.\"\n\nThough he's happy for his own freedom, he told The Advocate, he's \"not completely happy\" because he can't forget the people he's leaving behind at the Angola prison who may also have had wrongful convictions.\n\n\"I'm not free until they're free,\" Williams said."

Barr has promised to be as transparent as possible, but it's unclear how extensive or detailed Barr's own \"report\" to Congress will be.\n\nIn a letter to the leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary committees, Barr wrote that he intends to \"consult with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Special Counsel Mueller to determine what other information from the report can be released to Congress and the public consistent with the law.\"\n\nA senior Department of Justice official told ABC News on Friday that the report would not include any further indictments.\n\nMueller and his team investigated how far the Kremlin went to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, including trying to determine whether any Americans may have helped those efforts.\n\nAt the heart of Mueller\u2019s probe were two Russian operations: the spread of disinformation on social media, and the release of thousands of sensitive emails stolen by hackers from the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic targets. Mueller\u2019s team has charged 25 Russian nationals and three foreign companies for their alleged role in those operations.\n\nIn appointing a special counsel to investigate, however, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein also directed Mueller to look into \u201callegations\u201d of possible \u201ccoordination\u201d between Russian operatives and associates of President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies have derided the investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d But Rosenstein, FBI Director Chris Wray and Barr have each explicitly disputed that description.\n\nAt least four Trump associates, including Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, have pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents during the Russia-related investigation.\n\nAnother Trump associate, the president\u2019s former attorney Michael Cohen, has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump\u2019s business dealings in Moscow. And former Trump adviser Roger Stone has been charged with lying to Congress about his alleged role in tracking information stolen from Democrats during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n(Leah Millis/Reuters) The Department of Justice building is pictured in Washington D.C., March 21, 2019.\n\nMueller\u2019s investigation grew out of a probe the FBI launched in late July 2016.\n\nBy then, the FBI was already scrutinizing Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort\u2019s business dealings with pro-Russian officials in Ukraine \u2013 dealings that have since landed Manafort in jail. And the FBI was keeping tabs on Trump adviser Carter Page, who was previously targeted for recruitment by Russian spies and had raised eyebrows with a trip to Moscow in mid-July 2016.\n\nBut claims by Trump adviser George Papadopoulos \u2013 that the Russians were touting \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton \u2013 really set off alarms inside the FBI.\n\n\u201cIf any Americans were part of helping the Russians [attack] us, that is a very big deal,\u201d James Comey, who was FBI director at the time, later told lawmakers.\n\nSeveral weeks after formally launching the Russia probe, counterintelligence agents leading the investigation in Washington received a so-called \u201cdossier,\u201d which had been compiled at the behest of Democrats and detailed uncorroborated allegations of coordination between Trump\u2019s campaign and the Kremlin.\n\nSome of the allegations involved Page, who was already on the FBI\u2019s radar, so agents began secretly intercepting his communications. Page has never been charged with any crimes.\n\nThe wide-ranging investigation continued even after Trump took office. After Jeff Sessions became attorney general, he recused himself from oversight of the FBI\u2019s Russia-related probe, citing his previous advocacy for Trump on the campaign trail.\n\nRosenstein subsequently assumed oversight of the investigation.\n\nAnd then Trump shocked the federal law enforcement community: He fired Comey.\n\nThe move prompted Rosenstein to appoint Mueller to take over the whole matter, including a review of whether Comey's firing and other actions meant Trump improperly tried to obstruct the probe.\n\nComey later alleged that in a private meeting with Trump before his removal, the president directed Comey to \u201clet [Flynn] go.\u201d\n\nMueller has not released any evidence suggesting Trump committed a crime related to Russian efforts.\n\nHowever, Mueller did uncover evidence of other possible crimes and referred those cases to other federal prosecutors.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Manhattan ended up tying Trump to federal campaign violations, alleging that \u2013 in the midst of the 2016 presidential campaign \u2013 Trump personally directed Cohen to silence two woman claiming affairs with Trump by making illegal payments to them; Trump has repeatedly denied the affairs.\n\nCohen has pleaded guilty for his role in the matter, but no other charges have been filed.\n\nABC News' Pierre Thomas, John Santucci and Kyra Phillips contributed to this report."

  "title": "FDA takes up decades-long debate over breast implant safety",
  "authors": [],
  "text": "U.S. health officials are taking another look at the safety of breast implants, the latest review in a decades-long debate.\n\nAt a two-day meeting that starts Monday, a panel of experts for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will hear from researchers, plastic surgeons and implant makers, as well as from women who believe their ailments were caused by the implants.\n\nThe panel will consider next steps, but for now, the FDA isn't proposing any new restrictions or warnings. The agency's longstanding position is that implants are essentially safe as long as women understand they can have complications, including scarring, pain, swelling and implant rupture.\n\nBut the FDA and other regulators around the world have been grappling with how to manage a recently confirmed link to a rare cancer and the thousands of unconfirmed complaints of other health problems.\n\nIn documents released before the meeting, FDA regulators said it is \"impossible\" for them to determine how frequently the cancer \u2014 a form of lymphoma \u2014 occurs because the U.S. does not track the total number of implants on the market. Estimates of the frequency of the disease range from 1 in 3,000 women to 1 in 30,000.\n\nMost confirmed cases of the disease, known as breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma, have involved a particular style of implants with a textured surface, designed to reduce scar tissue and slippage. But the FDA said it has also received reports of the disease in smooth implants \u2014 which account for most of the U.S. market \u2014 raising questions about whether the cancer is a risk with both implant types.\n\nThe disease is not breast cancer, but a form of cancer that attacks the immune system and usually forms in the scar tissue surrounding implants. It grows slowly and can usually be successfully treated by surgically removing the implants.\n\nThousands of women have also blamed their implants for a host of ailments, including rheumatoid arthritis, chronic fatigue and muscle pain. In the documents, the FDA reiterated its position that \"there is not sufficient evidence\" linking them to breast implants. The agency also sidestepped requests from patients to add a boxed warning \u2014 the agency's most serious type \u2014 to breast implants and to require manufacturers to give women a checklist of potential harms and complications before surgery.\n\n\"I'm a little discouraged,\" said Jamee Cook, one of more than 20 patients set to speak at the meeting, after reviewing the FDA materials. \"But I guess I'm hoping that what we have to say will prompt discussion on those action points.\"\n\nA former paramedic, Cook said she had an array of health problems after getting implants in 1998, including exhaustion, migraines and an immune system disorder. She said her symptoms either resolved or improved after the implants were removed in 2015.\n\nBreast augmentation is the most popular form of cosmetic surgery in the U.S., with roughly 300,000 women undergoing the procedure each year. Another 100,000 women receive implants for breast reconstruction after cancer surgery. Most women choose silicone gel-filled implants, which are considered more natural looking than saline implants.\n\nImplants first went on sale in the mid-1960s. But they attracted little attention until the late 1980s, when a wave of lawsuits alleged serious harms and diseases linked to the devices. The FDA banned the silicone gel type in 1992 because of fears they might cause breast cancer, lupus and other disorders. But when studies seemed to rule out most of the disease concern, regulators returned the implants to the market in 2006 with the requirement that manufacturers track recipients to see how they fare long term.\n\nImplant makers Allergan and Mentor \u2014 which is now part of Johnson & Johnson \u2014 enrolled nearly 100,000 women in a 10-year study. But more than half of the women dropped out within three years, leaving insufficient data to draw firm safety conclusions.\n\nLast September, researchers at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center analyzed the company reports and found that women with silicone implants seemed to have greater rates of an immune system disorder called Sjogren syndrome, a connective tissue disorder called scleroderma and the skin cancer melanoma. But the authors acknowledged the limitations of the data, which often relied on incomplete, undiagnosed patient reports. FDA regulators said they \"respectfully disagree\" with the conclusions.\n\nLast week, the FDA sent warning letters to Mentor and a smaller implant maker, Sientra, for failing to enroll or retain enough patients in their long-term studies. Allergan and the other U.S. manufacturer of breast implants \u2014 Ideal Implant \u2014 did not receive warnings.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Matthew Perrone at @AP\u2014FDAwriter\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

  "authors": [],
  "text": "This is the letter sent to Congress from Attorney General William Barr summarizing Robert Mueller's report.\n\nDear Chairman Graham, Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Ranking Member Collins:\n\nAs a supplement to the notification provided on Friday, March 22, 2019, I am writing today to advise you of the principal conclusions reached by Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III and to inform you about the status of my initial review of the report he has prepared.\n\nThe Special Counsel's Report\n\nOn Friday, the Special Counsel submitted to me a \"confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions\" he has reached, as required by 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.8(c). This report is entitled \"Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election.\" Although my review is ongoing, I believe that it is in the public interest to describe the report and to summarize the principal conclusions reached by the Special Counsel and the results of his investigation.\n\nThe report explains that the\u00b7 Special Counsel and his staff thoroughly investigated allegations that members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump, and others associated with it, conspired with the Russian government in its efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, or sought to obstruct the related federal investigations. In the report, the Special Counsel noted that, in completing his investigation, he employed 19 lawyers who were assisted by a team of approximately 40 FBI agents, intelligence analysts, forensic accountants, and other professional staff. The Special Counsel issued more than 2,800 subpoenas, executed nearly 500 search warrants, obtained more than 230 orders for communication records, issued almost 50 orders authorizing use of pen registers, made 13 requests to foreign governments for evidence, and interviewed approximately 500 witnesses.\n\n(Win McNamee/Getty Images) U.S. Attorney General William Barr departs his home March 22, 2019 in McLean, Va.\n\nThe Special Counsel obtained a number of indictments and convictions of individuals and entities in connection with his investigation, all of which have been publicly disclosed. During the course of his investigation, the Special Counsel also referred several matters to other offices for further action. The report does not recommend any further indictments, nor did the Special Counsel obtain any sealed indictments that have yet to be made public. Below, I summarize the principal conclusions set out in the Special Counsel's report.\n\nRussian Interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. The Special Counsel's report is divided into two parts. The first describes the results of the Special Counsel's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The report outlines the Russian effort to influence the election and documents crimes committed by persons associated with the Russian government in connection with those efforts. The report further explains that a primary consideration for the Special Counsel's investigation was whether any Americans -including individuals associated with the Trump campaign - joined the Russian conspiracies to influence the election, which would be a federal crime. The Special Counsel's investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. As the report states: \"[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\"\n\n[Footnote from letter: In assessing potential conspiracy charges, the Special Counsel also considered whether members of the Trump campaign \"coordinated\" with Russian election interference activities. The Special Counsel defined \"coordination\" as an \"agreement-tacit or express-between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference.\"]\n\nThe Special Counsel's investigation determined that there were two main Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election. The first involved attempts by a Russian organization, the Internet Research Agency (IRA), to conduct disinformation and social media operations in the United States designed to sow social discord, eventually with the aim of interfering with the election. As noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that any U.S. person or Trump campaign official or associate conspired or knowingly coordinated with the IRA in its efforts, although the Special Counsel brought criminal charges against a number of Russian nationals and entities in connection with these activities.\n\nThe second element involved the Russian government's efforts to conduct computer hacking operations designed to gather and disseminate information to influence the election. The Special Counsel found that Russian government actors successfully hacked into computers and obtained emails from persons affiliated with the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations, and publicly disseminated those materials through various intermediaries, including WikiLeaks. Based on these activities, the Special Counsel brought criminal charges against a number of Russian military officers for conspiring to hack into computers in the United States for purposes of influencing the election. But as noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts, despite multiple. offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.\n\n(Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images) Special counsel Robert Mueller walks with his wife Ann Mueller, March 24, 2019, in Washington, D.C. Mueller has delivered his report on alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election to Attorney General William Barr.\n\nObstruction of Justice. The report's second part addresses a number of actions by the President - most of which have been the subject of public reporting - that the Special Counsel investigated as potentially raising obstruction-of-justice concerns. After making a \"thorough factual investigation\" into these matters, the Special Counsel considered whether to evaluate the conduct under Department standards governing prosecution and declination decisions but ultimately determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment. The Special Counsel therefore did not draw a conclusion - one way or the other - as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction. Instead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the Special Counsel views as \"difficult issues\" of law and fact concerning whether the President's actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction .. The Special Counsel states that \"while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\"\n\nPresident Trump (MORE: in a 'great mood' as Washington waits for Attorney General William Barr to act on special counsel report: Sources)\n\nThe Special Counsel's decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves itto the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime. Over the course of the investigation, the Special Counsel's office engaged in discussions with certain Department officials regarding many of the legal and factual matters at issue in the Special Counsel's obstruction investigation. After reviewing the Special Counsel's final report on these issues; consulting with Department officials, including the Office of Legal Counsel; and applying the principles of federal prosecution that guide our charging decisions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense. Our determination was made without regard to, and is not based on, the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president.\n\n[Footnote from letter: See A Sitting President's Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution, 24 Op. O.L.C. 222 (2000).]\n\n(Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images) President Donald Trump speaks to the press before boarding Marine One as he departs from the South Lawn of the White House, March 22, 2019.\n\nIn making this determination, we noted that the Special Counsel recognized that \"the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,\" and that, while not determinative, the absence of such evidence bears upon the President's intent with respect to obstruction. Generally speaking, to obtain and sustain an obstruction conviction, the government would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person, acting with corrupt intent, engaged in obstructive conduct with a sufficient nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding. In cataloguing the President's actions, many of which took place in public view, the report identifies no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent, each of which, under the Department's principles of federal prosecution guiding charging decisions, would need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish an obstruction-of\u00acjustice offense.\n\n37,040-41 (July 9, 1999). As I have previously stated, however, I am mindful of the public interest in this matter. For that reason, my goal and intent is to release as much of the Special Counsel's report as I can consistent with applicable law, regulations, and Departmental policies.\n\nBased on my discussions with the Special Counsel and my initial review, it is apparent that the report contains material that is or could be subject to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6( e ), which imposes restrictions on the use and disclosure of information relating to \"matter[ s] occurring before [a] grand jury.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(2)(B). Rule 6(e) generally limits disclosure of certain grand jury information in a criminal investigation and prosecution. Id. Disclosure of 6( e) material beyond the strict limits set forth in the rule is a crime in certain circumstances. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(3). This restriction protects the integrity of grand jury proceedings and ensures that the unique and invaluable investigative powers of a grand jury are used strictly for their intended criminal justice function. Given these restrictions, the schedule for processing the report depends in part on how quickly the Department can identify the 6( e) material that by law cannot be made public. I have requested the assistance of the Special Counsel in identifying all 6( e) information contained in the report as quickly as possible. Separately, I also must identify any information that could impact other ongoing matters, including those that the Special Counsel has referred to other offices. As soon as that process is complete, I will be in a position to move forward expeditiously in determining what can be released in light of applicable law, regulations, and Departmental policies.\n\nAs I observed in my initial notification, the Special Counsel regulations provide that \"the Attorney General may determine that public release of' notifications to your respective Committees \"would be in the public interest.\" 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.9(c). I have so determined, and I will disclose this letter to the public after delivering it to you."

  "text": "It was the Instagram post that shook the NFL. New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski took to the social-media platform Sunday night to announce what had been speculated for the better part of two years: He was retiring from football at age 29, leaving the Pats less than two months after New England won Super Bowl LIII. Despite his relatively short career, Gronk seems like an ironclad lock for the Pro Football Hall of Fame based on his three championships and many spike-worthy touchdowns. And there\u2019s plenty of evidence that the traditional markers of tight end production undersell Gronkowski\u2019s success. When healthy, Gronk was one of the most efficient offensive weapons in NFL history, notable as much for the nightmares he caused defenses as for the short amount of time his star shone (or his party-loving ways off the field).\n\nNot that Gronkowski\u2019s conventional stats are anything to scoff at. He was named to the Pro Bowl in five of the seven seasons in which he played more than half of the Patriots\u2019 games and was the first-team All-Pro tight end in four of those years. In the 2010s, no tight end had more receiving yards, and no receiver of any kind scored more receiving touchdowns. Only two tight ends in history \u2014 Antonio Gates and Tony Gonzalez \u2014 have more regular-season career TD catches, and Gronkowski caught 12 more in the postseason, which ties him with John Stallworth for the second-most playoff TDs among all players behind Jerry Rice.\n\nOn a per-16-game basis, the average Gronk campaign would consist of 72 catches, 1,094 yards and 11 touchdowns \u2014 numbers that would rank among the top 25 tight end seasons in history. And Gronkowski sustained that pace for nine seasons.\n\nThose numbers are only scratching the surface in terms of how valuable Gronk was to Tom Brady and the Patriots over the years. On a per-target basis, Gronkowksi picked up 9.9 yards \u2014 basically an entire first down every time the ball was thrown in his direction \u2014 according to Pro-Football-Reference.com. Since 1992 (the first season for target data on PFR), that\u2019s the best of any receiver \u2014 wideout or tight end \u2014 in the NFL.\n\nGood things happened when you throw to Gronk Most career yards per target for NFL players, 1992-2018 Player Position Targets Yards yards per target 1 Rob Gronkowski TE 794 7,861 9.9 2 Julio Jones WR 1,095 10,731 9.8 3 Malcom Floyd WR 570 5,550 9.7 4 DeSean Jackson WR 1,057 10,261 9.7 5 Brandin Cooks WR 546 5,147 9.4 6 Michael Irvin WR 960 8,936 9.3 7 Jordy Nelson WR 924 8,587 9.3 8 T.Y. Hilton WR 878 8,097 9.2 9 Doug Baldwin WR 722 6,563 9.1 10 Travis Kelce TE 579 5,236 9.0 Among players with at least 500 career targets Source: Pro-Football-Reference.com\n\nRemember longtime Vikings WR Cris Carter\u2019s old reputation \u2014 \u201call he does is catch touchdowns\u201d? For Gronkowski, that was closer to being true than for any player of his generation \u2014 and it was a very good thing for the Patriots. With 521 career receptions and 79 career touchdown grabs, Gronk hauled in a TD once every 6.6 catches. Only eight players in NFL history with a minimum of 400 lifetime receptions \u2014 Don Hutson, Paul Warfield, Tommy McDonald, Art Powell, Jimmy Orr, Wesley Walker, Randy Moss and Lance Alworth \u2014 caught touchdowns as a greater share of their total catches than Gronkowski did.\n\nWith those rates of great things happening whenever he was involved in the play, it\u2019s easy to make a case that Gronkowski was the most efficient receiver (of any type) in NFL history. What\u2019s more, Gronkowski consistently made his teammates more efficient, too.\n\nWhen our colleague Kyle Wagner looked at Gronk\u2019s impact during the 2017-18 playoffs, he found that Brady\u2019s passing efficiency numbers were significantly higher when his favorite tight end was on the field than not, one of the big ways Gronkowski has been a secret weapon for the Pats during the latter phase of their record-smashing dynasty. Since Gronk\u2019s debut in 2010, Brady\u2019s passer rating when targeting Gronkowski is 124.7, but it was just 96.8 when throwing to any other receiver. Even when it came to the greatest quarterback of all time, Gronkowski found a way to make him look much better.\n\nAnd then there was Gronkowski\u2019s effect as a blocker. He frequently graded out as the best blocking tight end in the game, according to ProFootballFocus.com\u2019s ratings. This aspect of his game made Gronk an asset whether the play call was a pass or run \u2014 keeping the Patriots from having to sub him in and out depending on the situation, or having his presence tip the Pats\u2019 hand on which type of play was coming. No matter what Gronkowski was asked to do, he generated a mismatch with the defense.\n\n(All of this is to say nothing of the fun-loving image Gronkowski cultivated both on and off the field. We\u2019ll leave others to judge his extracurricular activities, but we\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t reference this great description of Gronkowski\u2019s playing style from The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jason Gay: He was \u201csix-foot-6, 265 pounds, galloping straight at you in the open field like a pony who just broke loose at a children\u2019s birthday party.\u201d)\n\nGronkowski was still a valuable player in 2018, but there\u2019s no denying that he was a shell of his old self. According to ProFootballFocus, he was ranked 11th best overall at the position. But as he showed in the Patriots\u2019 Super Bowl victory this year, Gronkowski could still be a game-changing player. His 29-yard reception in the fourth quarter set New England up on the goal line, leading to the game\u2019s only touchdown. While Gronkowksi\u2019s impact as a blocker generated great fanfare during the regular season and in the playoffs, he also was the team\u2019s primary downfield weapon after Josh Gordon exited New England, averaging 16.4 air yards per reception, according to ESPN\u2019s Stats & Information Group. That was more than 50 percent greater than Brady\u2019s overall mark per attempt during the same span.\n\nFew Hall of Famers have ever retired before their age-30 season, but Gronkowski is destined to join a group that also includes Jim Brown, Terrell Davis, Kenny Easley and Gale Sayers (among modern players). Though his time in the NFL was relatively short, Gronk made his mark on the league as a receiver, blocker and all-around offensive terror. The game \u2014 and its greatest quarterback \u2014 will miss him dearly next season."
