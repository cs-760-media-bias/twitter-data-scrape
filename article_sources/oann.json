    "text": "OAN Newsroom\n\nUPDATED 1:13 PM PT \u2014 Tuesday, March 26, 2019\n\nChicago Police and the city\u2019s mayor express outrage after prosecutors drop charges against Jussie Smolett in connection with allegations of planning and carrying out a hate crime against himself.\n\nDuring a press briefing Tuesday, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson accused prosecutors of brokering a deal with defense attorneys to clear Smollett of state charges. Johnson said justice was not served in this case. He stands by the evidence, and said charges were rightfully filed.\n\nChicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said the unexpected move sends a clear message that if you\u2019re in a position of influence you will be treated differently.\n\n\u201cMr. Smolett is still saying that he is innocent, still running down the Chicago Police Department \u2014 how dare him, how dare him after everybody saw, and I want to remind you this is not the superintendent\u2019s word against his\u2026the grand jury\u2026a sliver of the evidence\u2026they came to a conclusion as did the state\u2019s attorneys office,\u201d he stressed. \u201cThis is not superintendent and the detective\u2019s department\u2019s word against his, and even after this white wash, still no sense of ownership of what he\u2019s done \u2014 he says that, in fact, he is the wronged in this case.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump Jr. applauded Emanuel for his response.\n\nProsecutors said they made the decision, because they believe a jury would not find Smollett guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nOthers argue the Cook County State attorney \u2014 Kim Foxx \u2014 did it for political reasons, citing her previous recusal from the case over conflict of interest. Reports also cited Foxx\u2019s connection to left-wing Hollywood players, and the nearly half a million dollar donation she received from billionaire liberal George Soros.\n\nSmollett could still face federal charges."

As above, a breath of fresh air that has become my go-to source for news.\n\n\n\nSince I wrote this review I have learned Amazon no longer carries OAN (confirmed today). Talked today with customer service rep who swore up, down, and sideways that the move was not political (methinks the gentleman protested too much (and I now know why)). I guess I was a bit paranoid that it might be political, inasmuch as Mr. Bezos bought the Washington Post and immediately detached 20 \"reporters\" to get out and find lots of dirt about Trump. Nothing turned up (unless it was they who found a private conversation that somewhat embarrassed the Donald. Anyway, we all know how that turned out for Mr. B (for Billions). Maybe this move (on OAN) will turn out the same for him. If the rants in this space are any indication, it may happen in time. A smart businessman leaves his politics at home. As for me, I'm sticking with OAN, wherever they go. If you don't know, the network is on Frontier (who'd have thought that). Haven't checked Sony, Apple, or anywhere else."

Over the weekend, the El Paso sector was forced to shut down its checkpoints, so agents could help process asylum applicants.\n\nThe Texas Monthly magazine was the first to break the news, revealing agents who usually inspect cargo were reassigned indefinitely. This impacted all checkpoints spanning from New Mexico to the Rio Grande in Texas.\n\nWhile border apprehensions are down from last year, it comes at a time when the country is grappling with an influx of migration.\n\nSeveral caravans from Central America have traveled to the U.S. in the last year, bringing thousands of migrants to the border and driving up wait times to file for asylum. This influx is putting intense strain on Border Patrol, who have said their facilities were not designed to process so many people at once.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear that this wave of migration will be slowing any time soon. Smugglers in Central America have reportedly been stepping up their operations by advertising that they can get migrants to the U.S. border in a matter of days. Once they do arrive, however, migrants face the long battle of convincing U.S. immigration judges their asylum claims are valid and they deserve to stay in the U.S."

As the president was headed to Florida on Air Force One Friday, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders showed reporters a map of the region and stated ISIS territory in the region is now completely destroyed.\n\nSecretary Sanders then referred all questions to the Pentagon.\n\nThis comes after U.S.- backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) announced they were clearing out the last areas held by ISIS in the city of Baghouz on Thursday.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted about ISIS shortly after Sanders spoke with the press. He condemned the terror group\u2019s extremist propaganda, saying it is the only thing keeping them alive."

Paris police have announced that demonstrations will be banned on that street on Saturday.\n\nFrench soldiers will also be deployed across the country to help maintain security.\n\n\u201cI think using the army is risky, because the protesters, the violent ones, are only waiting for one thing \u2014 a blunder, which is a huge problem,\u201d said Olivier Procacce, a businessman from Lyon, France. \u201cBut if it happens, they\u2019re going to blame the government again, so it\u2019s a trap and they (the army) have to be careful not to fall into the trap.\u201d\n\nThe weekly protests started in November over gas tax increases, but have evolved into anti-government demonstrations against President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s policies."

It would be under the Department of the Air Force (DAF), which is similar to the Marine Corps\u2019 relationship with the Navy.\n\nThe Pentagon has requested more than $72 million for fiscal year 2020 to set up the branch.

Roughly 25,000 retired miners depend on the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund that was established in 1978, with that number increasing in recent years.\n\nDoctors working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are also seeing younger miners diagnosed with the disease, especially in big coal country states like Kentucky.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at men in their 30s and their 40s on oxygen, being evaluated for lung transplant, which was unheard of even when I was worked in the mines or my father worked in the mines,\u201d stated Dr. Brandon Crumm. \u201cWe never saw or heard of anything like that and we were around it every single day.\u201d\n\nBlack lung restricts lung function due to scaring left behind from years of inhaling coal and silica dust. It affects about one-in-five workers who spent an average of 25 years in the Central Appalachian mines.\n\nVirginia native and ex-miner John Robinson is one of those five people. His monthly bills total around $4,000 for critical machinery just to help him breathe.\n\n\u201cI use oxygen, three-percent of oxygen, and a CPAP every night and then during the day,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf I get out here and get myself messed up, get short of wind, I have to come in the house and use my oxygen.\u201d\n\nA federal watchdog decried cutting taxes on coal companies over concerns it would hurt the miners disability fund.\n\nBack in January, the warned the trust is at risk of depletion by 2020 if Congress failed to extend or increase taxes on coal production. However, the industry disagrees and has argued the program\u2019s financial struggles are a result of government mismanagement and fraud.\n\nThe Disability Fund provides monthly payments and treatments to black lung sufferers, and is largely financed by taxes on coal production.\n\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill are said to be in talks to enact legislation to restore the coal tax over the next decade. However, Washington\u2019s treatment of the nation\u2019s miners leaves Robinson with harsh words of criticism.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re pretty important, coal miners are, but they just ain\u2019t being done right,\u201d he stated. \u201cThey\u2019re being robbed, they really are being robbed.\u201d"

However, Bharara isn\u2019t buying that explanation.\n\n\u201cAnd I tend to believe that he (Rosenstein) was not joking, because there has been a certain kind of conduct that happens and when you\u2019re use to someone, seeing someone tell untruths about what happens in a conversation and you care about your own integrity \u2014 I didn\u2019t want anybody to say you had some side conversation with the President of the Untied States,\u201d expalined Bharara.\n\nAfter the Trump administration took over the White House, he and 46 other attorneys were fired after refusing to resign.

    "text": "OAN Newsroom\n\nUPDATED 6:24 AM PT \u2014 Wednesday, March 20, 2019\n\nThe Green New Deal is offering, among other things, a plan to convert the U.S. to 100-percent clean energy by 2030. However, mounting research suggests the proposed plan would both be costly and difficult to apply due to massive infrastructure changes that would be essential for it to work.\n\nThe Democrat-proposed bill has faced a host of criticism from both politicians and economists in regards to the pricing and implementation of the bill.\n\nSome studies, such as one from the non-profit American Action Forum, has suggested the proposed bill would cost between 51 to 93 trillion dollars in taxpayer money over the next decade.\n\nAnother major issue plaguing the potentially costly bill is the proposal of the U.S. switching to 100-percent clean energy by 2030. Experts warn without proper updates to the country\u2019s transmission lines it would essentially be impossible to transport an adequate amount of wind and solar energy from energy farms, which would be in mostly rural areas. This means cities would be left with insufficient energy unless they implement large-scale infrastructure overhauls.\n\nHowever, a new report released this month by economists from The Brattle Group found 30 to 90 billion dollars would have to be spent on transmission lines by 2030 to serve the deal\u2019s plans for clean energy. This translates a 20 to 50 percent increase in average annual transmission spending compared to the past decade.\n\nAnother problem is how the nationwide infrastructure overhaul would be implemented. Approving transmission lines is a decade-long process between proposals and approval from local and state governments. In fact, states have most of the power in approving transmission lines, not the federal government. This means if state governments decide they do not wish to upgrade their power lines, the federal government would have little to no ways of combating their decision.\n\nSo, as a growing number of Democrats continue to support the bill, questions continue to arise surrounding its practicality."

Additionally, in the 90\u2019s he also voted in favor of legislation to outlaw gay marriage.\n\nPoliticians have said given the changes in his platform, Biden could easily be painted as a \u2018flip-flopper.\u2019 This could potentially mean it will be an uphill battle to gain support from both the right and left if he confirms his run."

The United States spends over $268 billion dollars a year supporting illegal aliens. That money covers expenses such as healthcare, education, childcare, the justice system, and welfare\u2014forcing US taxpayers to shell out $734 million dollars every single day.

It argues that applicants who played by the rules were victimized when these wealthy parents paid bribes enabling unqualified students to get into highly selective universities.\n\nLegal experts say the student could have difficulty holding the colleges responsible.

This exceeds the limits the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) places on ground-launched missiles.\n\nLast month, President Trump said he would pull out of the 1987 agreement within six-months if Russia continued to violate the terms of the treaty.\n\n\u201cI hope that we are able to get everybody in a big and beautiful room and do a new treaty that would be much better, cause certainly I would like to see that, but you have to have everybody adhere to it and you have a certain side that almost pretends it doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d stated the president.\n\nThe Kremlin has repeatedly denied accusations of breaking the agreement. Instead, they are claiming the U.S. is the one in violation of the accord.\n\nRussia suspended its side of the long-standing agreement last week as it reportedly continues to develop missile capabilities.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin made a statement last month, claiming if the U.S. were to deploy missiles in Europe then Russia would be forced to respond swiftly.\n\n\u201cRussia will be forced to create and develop weapons, which can be used not only towards those territories that from which direct threats may be directed at us, but also towards those territories where centers of decision making in employing rocket systems that are threatening to us,\u201d stated the Russian president.\n\nWhile no current plans have been announced for the U.S. to deploy missiles in Europe, President Trump has said the U.S. would not back down from developing a military response to counter Russia\u2019s actions.\n\nThe U.S. military plans to roll out the missile for deployment within 18-months if testing proves a success. There are also plans to test a second intermediate range missile in November.\n\nWith hopes for reconciliation of the INF Treaty quickly fleeting, only time will tell if a new Cold War -style nuclear arms race will soon emerge."

Patrick McHenry, ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nAt the hearing, CEO Tim Sloan reiterated the nation\u2019s fourth largest bank has taken steps to correct past issues. Those issues include the opening of millions of fake bank accounts and credit cards for its consumers in 2016, which was done in order to meet unrealistic sales goals. It also includes its mortgage scandal in which it mistakenly foreclosed hundreds of homes after improperly handling mortgage applications.\n\n\u201cThe past few years have reinforced to us that our company does well by doing right, and doing right does not stop with simply repairing harm and rebuilding trust,\u201d said Sloan. \u201cWe have more work to do and that is an ongoing commitment by all of Wells Fargo\u2019s 260000 team members starting with me.\u201d\n\nHowever, lawmakers, including committee chairwoman Maxine Waters, questioned whether the bank should be reined in over its past indiscretions.\n\n\u201cWith all of this experience and the length of time that you have been there, the roles you have played, you have not been able to keep Wells Fargo out of trouble,\u201d she stated. \u201cYou keep getting fined \u2014 why should Wells Fargo continue to be the size that it is, and should it be downsized or what else could be done?\u201d\n\nBy any means, Wells Fargo hasn\u2019t escaped totally scot-free. As Rep. Waters noted, the company has faced billions in fines over its past scandals. However, consumer advocates are saying that\u2019s not enough. They cited the financial damages millions of Americans have had to deal with as a result of the bank\u2019s behavior. Even worse, advocates have said despite dealing with billions of dollars in wealth, the bank and its leadership lack common sense."

The United States spends over $268 billion dollars a year supporting illegal aliens. That money covers expenses such as healthcare, education, childcare, the justice system, and welfare\u2014forcing US taxpayers to shell out $734 million dollars every single day. President Trump is requesting $5.7 billion dollars to build a border wall. Meanwhile, since January first, we\u2019ve already spent far more than that paying for aliens who are here illegally. These numbers are based off estimates from the Center for Immigration Studies, Federation for Immigration Reform, Institute for Defense Analyses, and the Department for Homeland Security.

The event was confirmed Tuesday, and will include Senator Amy Klobuchar and Senator Elizabeth Warren.\n\nAlso in attendance will be former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro and Ohio Representative Tim Ryan.\n\nThe event is expected to focus on how monopoly power has led to economic disparity, and the decline of rural America. The debate comes as candidates are questioning the power corporate giants have over the U.S. political system.\n\nLast week, Senator Warren expressed how she would approach the problem if she were elected president:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little like baseball \u2014 you could be an umpire, a platform, or you could own teams. That\u2019s fine, but you can\u2019t be an umpire and own one of the teams that\u2019s in the game. So the principal here, is to break those apart and you can work for the platform part, you can work for one of the teams, but if you work for one of the teams you compete like every other team in America.\u201d\n\nThe focus of the talks will revolve around how tech giants, like Facebook and Google, have damaged democracy. The debate is expected to take place on March 30th."

Romney called on Boeing to keep the crafts grounded until responders complete an investigation into the cause of the crash. Blumenthal followed suit, taking to Twitter to write:\n\nThe FAA & the airline industry must act quickly & decisively to protect American travelers, pilots, & flight attendants.

    "text": "OAN Newsroom\n\nUPDATED 11:08 AM PT \u2014 Tuesday, March 12, 2019\n\nSenate Republicans are inching closer toward deploying their last resort option in the face of Democrat obstruction.\n\nMembers of the GOP leadership caucus met with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday, where they considered the possible use of a procedural tactic called the nuclear option. This would allow Republicans to advance confirmation votes with only a simple majority instead of the current 60 vote threshold needed. The nuclear option has been triggered two times during the last six years by Republicans and Democrats alike.\n\nMcConnell said he\u2019d still prefer to strike a deal with Democrats to speed up the confirmation process for President Trump\u2019s nominees, but warned he would move forward with the nuclear option if they continue to block the president from filling a backlog of essential nominations.\n\nMcConnell explained how Democrats are taking advantage of current rules to eat up valuable floor time to delay nominations, even for candidates that are not considered controversial. He claimed this has lead to a crisis in the administration due to an enormous amount of vacancies below the cabinet level. This concern has been echoed by many in the upper chamber.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, what we are seeing on the other side is just obstruction, they don\u2019t want to move people,\u201d said Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan. \u201cCome on down, explain it \u2014 tell the American people why assistant secretaries across federal agencies, who have been waiting months to be confirmed by this body, who have been voted out of committee with big bipartisan numbers, sit and wait and wait and wait.\u201dThe measure would allow the Senate to consider an executive nominee or district judge after just two-hours of debate, substantially reducing the current 30-hour wait time after a cloture vote.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note nominations to the cabinet, supreme court or appellate court would be exempt from the rule change.\n\nAt this point, Republicans think they have the 50 votes needed to approve use of the nuclear option if Democrats refuse to work together to pass this measure in the traditional way.\n\nSenators Roy Blunt and John Cornyn, both members of the caucus, are confident the rules change proposal will receive a vote soon. They said it could happen as early as this month after senators get back from recess on March 25th."

    "text": "OAN Newsroom\n\nUPDATED 8:20 AM PT \u2014 Monday, March 11, 2019\n\nBy law the president is required to present his proposed budget to Congress by the first Monday in February, but it was delayed due to the partial government shutdown. With that now in the past, all eyes will be turning to the 2020 budget proposal, which is set to be officially unveiled on Monday.\n\nThe president reportedly plans to increase the $22 Trillion debt limit, while also looking to lift spending caps for domestic and defense programs by using war contingency funds to bypass budget limits.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the blueprint will request over $400 million to build a replacement VA hospital in Louisville, Kentucky. It would also cover the rest of the hospital\u2019s cost.\n\n\u201cThis will be the first time any presidential budget has included full funding for the entire VA medical center,\u201d said McConnell. \u201cThat will make it a lot easier for us when the appropriations process actually unfolds to complete the funding.\u201d\n\nMcConnell noted this will be a big relief to the more than 300,000 veterans who live in Kentucky.\n\n$100 million will reportedly be allocated to the Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative spearheaded by first daughter Ivanka Trump to help 50 million women in developing countries. That type of initiative has been supported by the president himself.\n\n\u201cBy investing in women around the world, we\u2019re investing in families, we\u2019re investing in prosperity, and we\u2019re investing in peace,\u201d the president stated. \u201cThe United States will continue to lead the world stage in developing policies to empower women financially in our modern economy.\u201d\n\nThe administration plans to receive the funding through the Agency for International Development, and be supported by other government programs in addition to private investment.\n\nHowever, other fields will be seeing some cuts. An Energy Department official said the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy would see its $2.3 billion budget slashed by around 70-percent to $700 million.\n\nPresident Trump is not expected to make cuts to Medicare and social security, but isn\u2019t likely to increase taxes either.\n\nThe president\u2019s budget will likely face opposition from Democrats as the party has the majority in the House.\n\nPresident Trump has touted his negotiation skills and has voiced in the past he won\u2019t sign off on any bad deals. Americans can assume the president will stoke that same message come Monday when the 2020 budget proposal is officially revealed."

    "text": "OAN Newsroom\n\nUPDATED 10:38 AM PT \u2014 Friday, March 8, 2019\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray is sounding the alarm over cybersecurity threats reaching unprecedented levels across the globe. Wray made the comment while speaking at the recent RSA Conference in San Francisco, which is the biggest cybersecurity event in the nation.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s cyber threat is bigger than any one government agency, frankly, bigger than government itself, but I think no agency brings the same combination of scope and scale, experience, tools, and relationships that the FBI has,\u201d said Wray.\n\nWhile the mainstream media has focused on the security threat Russia poses following the 2016 election, it has largely ignored the emerging threat China poses to U.S. cybersecurity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not somebody who is prone to hyperbole, but of all the things that surprised me when I came back into this world, the thing that most shocked me was the breadth, the depth, the scale of the Chinese counterintelligence threat,\u201d said the FBI director.\n\nAccording to recent reports from private intelligence firms, a group of Chinese hackers has targeted at least 27 universities worldwide. This includes the University of Hawaii, the University of Washington, and MIT.\n\nThese studies found the hackers mostly targeted schools that either have programs focusing on technology or staff that are experts in related fields. Experts say one reason for this is that universities are likely to exchange important information and research with colleagues from other research centers. This means hackers can pose as representatives from other institutions to gain valuable information about current research and technology without trying to infiltrate government servers.\n\nAlthough the Chinese government denies any connection with this hacking group, multiple intelligence agencies, including the FBI, have linked this particular firm to Beijing.\n\nWhile cybersecurity threats from China may not be going anywhere anytime soon, the FBI remains confident in its ability to thwart future attacks."

According to Jordan, Cohen has lied to the Oversight Committee at least seven times on a wide range of topics, including his alleged request for a presidential pardon.\n\n\u201cI have never asked for, nor would I accept, a pardon from Mr. Trump,\u201d Cohen claimed.\n\nThat statement later appeared to contradict remarks made by Cohen\u2019s own personal attorney.\n\n\u201cAll I can say is Mr. Cohen\u2019s got a story to tell, he was a leaky ship to begin with,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham. \u201cThere was discussions about a pardon and he denied it, but that just furthers the narrative that maybe he\u2019s not the best conveyor of the truth.\u201d\n\nThis comes after Cummings warned Cohen about the consequences for lying to Congress.\n\n\u201cI have made it abundantly clear to Mr. Cohen, that if he comes here today and he does not tell the truth, tell us the truth, I will be the first one to refer those untruthful statements to DOJ,\u201dstated Cummings. \u201cSo. when people say he doesn\u2019t have anything to lose, he does have a lot to lose if he lies\u201d.\n\nJordan was joined by Congressman Mark Meadows the day after Cohen\u2019s hearing in calling for the Justice Department to investigate the inconsistencies."

Florida Senator Marco Rubio said this was only a ploy to intimidate journalists from reporting on Guaido in the country.\n\nWeddle is the second journalist to be detained and interrogated by the Venezuelan government.

The study predicts this number could rise to more than 100,000 by the end of this year.\n\nResearchers also expect an increase in the number of migrant kidnappings, assaults, and robberies.\n\nOn Wednesday, Republican Congressman Dan Crenshaw brought attention to the issue of migrant girls being trafficked into the U.S. and forced into prostitution. He had this to say:\n\n\u201cThere was a young woman in my office yesterday, she\u2019s from Mexico, she\u2019s about 18 years old. She was taken across the border, kidnapped about five years ago on the third attempt, because they were turned back twice by Border Patrol. On the third attempt they made it through, and she was brought to NYC where raped approximately 30 times a day for five years. I don\u2019t know why nobody talks about that kinda stuff.\u201d\n\nPrinceton researchers suggested by expanding guest-worker programs, the U.S. could reduce criminal abuse and exploitation of migrants."

    "text": "Published on Mar 7, 2019\n\nAs Democrats in Congress refuse to secure the US southern border, the cost of illegal immigration continues to mount. The United States spends over $268 billion dollars a year supporting illegal aliens. That money covers expenses such as healthcare, education, childcare, the justice system, and welfare\u2014forcing US taxpayers to shell out $734 million dollars every single day. President Trump is requesting $5.7 billion dollars to build a border wall. Meanwhile, since January first, we\u2019ve already spent far more than that paying for aliens who are here illegally. These numbers are based off estimates from the Center for Immigration Studies, Federation for Immigration Reform, Institute for Defense Analyses, and the Department for Homeland Security. These are the most exact estimates from official Border Patrol reports, as well as crime stats and census reports. One America News will continue share these numbers daily to show just how much illegal immigration costs American citizens every second.\n\n\n\nVisit us at:\n\n\n\nWebsite: https://www.oann.com\n\n\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OneAmericaNe...\n\n\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OANN"

President Trump\u2019s former lawyer is coming under fire yet again, this time about his claims surrounding a presidential pardon.\n\nIn a new report by the Wall Street Journal Wednesday, Cohen\u2019s attorney \u2014 Lanny Davis \u2014 reportedly reached out to the president\u2019s legal team last spring to discuss a potential pardon. This is something Cohen has adamantly denied.\n\n\u201cI have never asked for, nor would I accept, a pardon from Mr. Trump,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe report goes on to allege Cohen made the call after the FBI raid on his law office and residence back in April.\n\nMost recently, Cohen\u2019s attorney said his client regrets his loyalty to President Trump, which is an ironic statement for someone reportedly seeking a pardon.\n\n\u201cNow that he saw Donald Trump as president, he underwent a genuine transformation because he feared for his country and his family when Donald Trump was president,\u201d said Davis. \u201cHe ended up lying and he has regretted it and he\u2019s going to jail for it, and he said to the court in his heartfelt way \u2014 I take ownership and I don\u2019t blame anybody but myself.\u201d\n\nCohen wrapped up another round of testimony before the House Intelligence Committee this week, saying he will continue to work and cooperate with Congress.\n\nThis all comes on the heels of a New York Times article Wednesday. It claimed multiple people involved in the special counsels investigation have also reached to Rudy Giuliani over the possibility of a presidential pardon.\n\nAccording to the Constitution, a sitting U.S. president only has the power to grant a pardon to someone convicted of a federal crime not a state level offense."

They said Manafort engaged in a scheme to hide tens of millions of dollars from the federal government by hiding money abroad, evading taxes, and defrauding several financial institutions.\n\nHowever, the crimes didn\u2019t stop there. The special counsel\u2019s office revealed last month that Manafort broke a plea deal by lying to investigators, meaning the possibility of a light sentence was thrown off the table.\n\n\u201cPaul Manafort\u2019s deceit has now extended to virtually everyone he\u2019s met, I mean his nose is longer than Pinocchio\u2019s at this point,\u201d said Rep.

Up until this week, his legal team had been calling for a lenient sentence. They have argued that due to his age and health, he could likely spend the rest of his life behind bars.\n\nHowever, the special counsel fired back by saying it\u2019s clear Manafort has no remorse for his crimes and hasn\u2019t taken responsibility for his actions.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear President Trump will be helping him out of his legal trouble.\n\n\u201cThe question was asked yesterday about pardons, with respect to Paul Manafort, who \u2014 it\u2019s very sad what\u2019s happened to Paul, the way he\u2019s bring treated, I\u2019ve never seen anybody treated so poorly \u2014 but the question was asked to me by the New York Post and I said no, I have not offered any pardons,\u201d said the president.\n\nThursday\u2019s sentencing in Virginia is just one of two Manafort faces.

He also cut the route by more than half.\n\n\u201cThe current project as planned would cost too much and respectfully take too long, and there\u2019s been too little oversight and not enough transparency,\u201d stated the California lawmaker.\n\nKelly said since the governor is not totally abandoning the project, the state is not in violation of its agreement. He blasted the Trump administration for halting an additional $930 million pledged for the project, calling the move illegal and wasteful.\n\nHowever, President Trump disagrees and has demanded the state to repay $2.5 billion dollars."

Additionally, two U.S. senators have proposed a motion, dubbed the \u2018Brink Act,\u2019 which would impose additional sanctions on any bank that does business with the North Korean government.\n\nThe threats come as new satellite images appear to show North Korea rebuilding a partially dismantled long-range missile site. Experts have said the images suggest a launch pad is under construction, but no missiles are in range. The rebuilding reportedly occurred sometime between mid-February and the beginning of March, but there is little evidence to suggest a new test is imminent.\n\nOn the other hand, this brings into question if the Korean Peninsula is really committed to denuclearization, which could challenge hopes of a potential third summit between President Trump and Kim Jong-un.\n\nBolton and other administration officials have continued to reiterate the president\u2019s stance on North Korea despite the two sides failing to a reach a consensus last week in Vietnam.\n\n\u201cThe possibility was there for North Korea to make a big deal with us to do complete denuclearization in exchange for the potential for a very bright economic future,\u201d said Bolton. \u201cThe president wanted to make that big deal, he pushed very hard for it \u2014 the North Koreans were not willing.\u201d\n\nThis week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo offered hopes of sending a U.S. delegation to North Korea as the president would like to continue to keep an open dialogue between the White House and Pyongyang.\n\nHowever, the president is continuing to advocate for a hard line approach with North Korea, assuring the only way sanctions will be eased is if they completely dismantle their nuclear program and all that comes with it."

    "text": "OAN Newsroom\n\nUPDATED 9:44 AM PT \u2014 Monday, March 4, 2019\n\nIsrael\u2019s prime minister recently recapped his trip to Russia with assurances President Vladimir Putin shares his goal of getting all foreign troops out of Syria.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu made those comments on Sunday after visiting Moscow for talks on Iran\u2019s presence in Syria. The Jewish leader said Iran is the biggest threat in the Middle East, and reiterated his stance that Israel will not allow Iran to have a permanent military presence so close to its borders.\n\nThis comes after Israel acknowledged carrying out several air strikes on Iranian military targets inside Syria in the past months.\n\nPutin pledged his help in getting all foreign troops out of Syria.\n\n\u201cPresident Putin and I also agreed on a shared goal \u2014 the removal from Syria of the foreign forces that came in after the civil war erupted,\u201d stated Netanyahu. \u201cWe agreed to set up a joint task force which, together with others, will work to advance toward this goal.\u201d\n\nIsrael said it will continue to carry out strikes. However, officials are saying there will now be an Israeli-Russia hot line, so the two countries don\u2019t accidentally clash in Syrian air space."

He said he is working to take concrete action to address the issue of detainees, abductees, and missing persons as well as to work on a new constitution for the country.\n\nDespite the imminent defeat of ISIS, Syria is still in political turmoil after years of civil war. More than five million Syrians fled to nearby countries since the start of the war seven-years ago. A UN expert said even though violence is down in Syria, many refugees are not returning home because of ongoing crimes against humanity.\n\nFrance, Germany, and the U.K. confirmed they won\u2019t help rebuild Syria until a political transition is underway.

However, Macron believes that they do not need more time, but instead need decisions.\n\n\u201cThe withdrawal agreement cannot be renegotiated,\u201d stated the French president. \u201cIf the British need more time, we could consider an extension request only if it is justified by a new choice of the British, but we would in no way accept an extension without a clear perspective on the objective being pursued.\u201d\n\nMerkel also weighed in by saying Germany and France \u201cagree completely\u201d that the already negotiated withdrawal agreement stands."

However, the motion was struck down.\n\nDuring his opening statement, Cohen told lawmakers the president instructed him to lie about his plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. He also called him a racist and accused him of knowing about damaging emails WikiLeaks obtained on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cHe is a racist, he is a con man, and he is a cheat,\u201d stated Cohen. \u201cHe was a presidential candidate, who knew that Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about a WikiLeaks drop on Democratic National Committee emails.\u201d\n\nHe also accused President Trump of threatening him and his family.\n\nFormer Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone has refuted Michael Cohen\u2019s allegation about the president\u2019s knowledge of his contact with WikiLeaks. On Wednesday, he told The Hill that Cohen\u2019s\u2019 claim \u201cis not true.\u201d Stone, who has been charged in the special counsel\u2019s probe, has previously denied knowing in advance about the emails or having direct contact with WikiLeaks.\n\nIn addition to Stone\u2019s denial, Cohen reportedly doesn\u2019t have any evidence other than his word to support his allegation.\n\nBoth the president and Republicans have accused Cohen of making up allegations in order to reduce his prison sentence after he was convicted of lying to Congress among other crimes."

Any guns inside the their home could be forcibly taken away by law enforcement.\n\nSpeaker Pelosi also spoke to the supportive crowd, claiming the law is not meant to stigmatize people with mental illnesses.\n\n\u201cWe just want to identify, prioritize to save lives and to save lives of the person themselves, a danger to themselves or to others,\u201d she explained.\n\nHowever, right before that she stated 99-percent of people diagnosed by a mental health professional are \u2014 what she called \u2014 \u201claw abiding citizens.\u201d\n\nOpponents argue the law will take away gun owner\u2019s due process rights, with the National Rifle Association calling it the \u201cmost dangerous\u201d out of all the gun control bills considered by New York lawmakers in 2019.\n\nDespite that, the bill was passed by the Democrat-controlled legislature in January. The law is now scheduled to take effect in August."

On Monday, the UN said nearly all of the polio cases in Afghanistan are linked to neighboring Pakistan, where people are freely crossing the border and spreading the disease.\n\nMany people in the area do not trust the polio vaccine, because a fake vaccination program was used as a cover to search for Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan. This led to rumors the injection is used for spying.\n\nIn response, the UN is continuing to have teams travel around Afghanistan to administer the vaccine in hopes of eradicating the disease.\n\n\u201cPolio is a dangerous virus in the world which targets children.

The two men, who reported to McCabe, denigrated her as weak and not up to the job after her divorce.\n\nMcCabe heard her out and told her that as long as she kept doing her job, she would have nothing to worry about, she said.\n\n\u201cIt was comforting and I thanked him, I said that is what I needed to hear,\u201d said the former supervisory agent, who had been a FBI liaison with both the Central Intelligence Agency and its military version, the Defense Intelligence Agency. \u201cI trusted him, but he\u2019s obviously a very good scammer, he plays with your emotions.\u201d\n\nWhat she did not know until later was that at the same time McCabe was telling her everything would be okay, he had already authorized an Office of Professional Responsibility investigation aimed at ended her career.\n\n\u201cI found out after I filed my discrimination complaint on June 15th, on July 20th Andrew McCabe had signed off and authorized an internal investigation into me on time and attendance and insubordination \u2014 just bogus charges,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was a strange twist that Gritz left the FBI in August 2013, eight months before her friend retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn was sacked as the commanding general of the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n\nGritz said she first met Flynn in 2005, when he was a lieutenant colonel serving at the director of intelligence at Joint Special Operations Command, Fort Bragg, North Carolina.\n\nWhile Flynn led the DIA, Gritz was an FBI liaison there. Then, after she filed her complaint and continued to pursue it after she left the bureau, the general was adamant in vouching for her professionalism."

However, soldiers set up roadblocks and got in scuffles with the lawmakers, so only a few vehicles managed to get close to Colombia by the end of the day.\n\n\u201cPretending that humanitarian aid is not going to reach Venezuela is an act of cruelty, we know that these soldiers are facing the same need as all the people of Venezuela \u2014 humanitarian aid comes in yes or yes,\u201d stated Venezuelan lawmaker Delsa Solorzano.\n\nTraffic was jammed along the border as troops tried to prevent people from crossing to bring back needed food and medicine.\n\n\u201cLook, this is just a taste of what happens everyday, and with violence. Nothing is achieved, we are victims of this on a daily basis.\u201d \u2014 Jose Martinez, Venezuelan citizen\n\nMaduro has continued to deny there is a humanitarian crisis at all, and has claimed aid efforts are just a front for the U.S. to invade the country. Protesters at the border are pushing for Maduro to let in the aid as the country faces shortages of food and medicine.\n\n\u201cMaduro wants to close the border, because he doesn\u2019t want to recognize that Venezuela is in an economic crisis, a food crisis, of heath care, of medical attention \u2014 he does not want to recognize it.\u201d \u2014 Frank Mendonca, Venezuelan citizen\n\nThe final showdown over humanitarian aid is set for Saturday after Guaido set the deadline for the government to let in the aid."

    "title": "Presidential Proclamation on Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "The current situation at the southern border presents a border security and humanitarian crisis that threatens core national security interests and constitutes a national emergency. The southern border is a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics. The problem of large-scale unlawful migration through the southern border is long-standing, and despite the executive branch\u2019s exercise of existing statutory authorities, the situation has worsened in certain respects in recent years. In particular, recent years have seen sharp increases in the number of family units entering and seeking entry to the United States and an inability to provide detention space for many of these aliens while their removal proceedings are pending. If not detained, such aliens are often released into the country and are often difficult to remove from the United States because they fail to appear for hearings, do not comply with orders of removal, or are otherwise difficult to locate. In response to the directive in my April 4, 2018, memorandum and subsequent requests for support by the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense has provided support and resources to the Department of Homeland Security at the southern border. Because of the gravity of the current emergency situation, it is necessary for the Armed Forces to provide additional support to address the crisis.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 201 and 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), hereby declare that a national emergency exists at the southern border of the United States, and that section 12302 of title 10, United States Code, is invoked and made available, according to its terms, to the Secretaries of the military departments concerned, subject to the direction of the Secretary of Defense in the case of the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. To provide additional authority to the Department of Defense to support the Federal Government\u2019s response to the emergency at the southern border, I hereby declare that this emergency requires use of the Armed Forces and, in accordance with section 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1631), that the construction authority provided in section 2808 of title 10, United States Code, is invoked and made available, according to its terms, to the Secretary of Defense and, at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense, to the Secretaries of the military departments. I hereby direct as follows:\n\nSection 1 . The Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of each relevant military department, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, shall order as many units or members of the Ready Reserve to active duty as the Secretary concerned, in the Secretary\u2019s discretion, determines to be appropriate to assist and support the activities of the Secretary of Homeland Security at the southern border.\n\nSec . 2 . The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and, subject to the discretion of the Secretary of Defense, the Secretaries of the military departments, shall take all appropriate actions, consistent with applicable law, to use or support the use of the authorities herein invoked, including, if necessary, the transfer and acceptance of jurisdiction over border lands.\n\nSec . 3 . This proclamation is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand nineteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-third.\n\nDONALD J. TRUMP"

    "text": "Published on Jan 17, 2019\n\nAs Democrats in Congress refuse to secure the US southern border, the cost of illegal immigration continues to mount. The United States spends over $268 billion dollars a year supporting illegal aliens. That money covers expenses such as healthcare, education, childcare, the justice system, and welfare\u2014forcing US taxpayers to shell out $734 million dollars every single day. President Trump is requesting $5.7 billion dollars to build a border wall. Meanwhile, since January first, we\u2019ve already spent far more than that paying for aliens who are here illegally. These numbers are based off estimates from the Center for Immigration Studies, Federation for Immigration Reform, Institute for Defense Analyses, and the Department for Homeland Security. These are the most exact estimates from official Border Patrol reports, as well as crime stats and census reports.

    "text": "My name is Brian Kolfage, I have a verified blue check facebook page as a public figure and I\u2019m a Purple Heart Recipient triple amputee veteran. Like a majority of those American citizens who voted to elect President Donald J Trump, we voted for him to Make America Great Again. President Trump\u2019s main campaign promise was to BUILD THE WALL. And as he\u2019s followed through on just about every promise so far, this wall project needs to be completed still. As a veteran who has given so much, 3 limbs, I feel deeply invested to this nation to ensure future generations have everything we have today. Too many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society. I have grandparents who immigrated to America legally, they did it the correct way and it\u2019s time we uphold our laws, and get this wall BUILT! It\u2019s up to Americans to help out and pitch in to get this project rolling. \u201cIf the 63 million people who voted for Trump each pledge $80, we can build the wall.\u201d That equates to roughly 5Billion Dollars, even if we get half, that\u2019s half the wall. We can do this. Democrats are going to stall this project by every means possible and play political games to ensure President Trump doesn\u2019t get his victor. They\u2019d rather see President Trump fail, than see America succeed. However, if we can fund a large portion of this wall, it will jumpstart things and will be less money Trump has to secure from our politicians. This won\u2019t be easy, but it\u2019s our duty as citizens. This needs to be shared every single day by each of you on social media. We can do it, and we can help President Trump make America safe again!"
