    "text": "Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III submitted a long-awaited report to Attorney General William P. Barr on Friday, marking the end of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible obstruction of justice by President Trump.\n\nThe submission of Mueller\u2019s report ends his closely watched inquiry \u2014 a case that has engulfed the Trump administration since its inception, leading to criminal charges against 34 people, including six former Trump associates and advisers.\n\nA senior Justice Department official said the special counsel has not recommended any further indictments \u2014 a revelation that buoyed Trump\u2019s supporters, even as other Trump-related investigations continue in other parts of the Justice Department. It is also unclear whether a Mueller report that does not result in additional charges could still hurt the president politically.\n\nJustice Department officials notified Congress late Friday that they had received Mueller\u2019s report, but they did not describe its contents. Barr is expected to summarize the findings for lawmakers as early as this weekend.\n\nOnly a small number of people inside the Justice Department know the document\u2019s contents, but it immediately sparked a furious political reaction, with Democrats vying for the presidential nomination in 2020 demanding a public release of the findings and the two top Democrats in Congress, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), calling for the full report and its \u201cunderlying documentation\u201d to be provided to Congress.\n\n[\u2018The watchword is transparency\u2019: Democrats ready to fight for Mueller\u2019s complete findings]\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters viewed the news as an optimistic indication that he was on the cusp of being vindicated.\n\n\u201cThe fact that there are no more indictments is a big deal,\u201d said David Bossie, a Trump ally. \u201cThis president has had his entire two-year presidency under a cloud of this fake, made-up Russian collusion story.\u201d\n\nTrump flew to his Florida resort Friday, accompanied by senior aides and White House lawyers. Trump did not immediately speak or tweet about the report\u2019s delivery. Privately, some Trump advisers expressed relief that the report had been filed, but the president\u2019s spokeswoman and lawyers were more guarded in their initial reaction.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said that the next steps \u201care up to Attorney General Barr, and we look forward to the process taking its course. The White House has not received or been briefed on the special counsel\u2019s report.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to the leaders of the House and Senate judiciary committees, Barr wrote that Mueller \u201chas concluded his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and related matters.\u201d\n\nView Graphic How public perception of Mueller changed over his two-year investigation\n\n[Read the attorney general\u2019s letter: Justice Dept. notification to Congress regarding the conclusion of the Mueller investigation]\n\nBarr wrote that Mueller submitted a report to him explaining his prosecution decisions. The attorney general told lawmakers he was reviewing the report and anticipated that \u201cI may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel\u2019s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend.\u201d\n\nThe attorney general wrote he would consult with Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein \u201cto determine what other information from the report can be released to Congress and the public consistent with the law, including the Special Counsel regulations, and the Department\u2019s long-standing practices and policies.\u201d\n\nBarr said there were no instances in the course of the investigation in which any of Mueller\u2019s decisions were vetoed by his superiors at the Justice Department.\n\n\u201cI remain committed to as much transparency as possible, and I will keep you informed as to the status of my review,\u201d Barr wrote.\n\nAfter a week of growing expectation that Mueller\u2019s report would soon arrive, a security officer from Mueller\u2019s office delivered it Friday afternoon to Rosenstein\u2019s office at Justice Department headquarters, according to spokeswoman Kerri Kupec. Within minutes of that delivery, the report was transmitted upstairs to Barr.\n\nAround 4:35 p.m., White House lawyer Emmet Flood was notified that the Justice Department had received the report. Around that same time, Rosenstein called Mueller to personally thank him for his work, according to a Justice Department official.\n\nAbout a half-hour after the White House was notified, a department official delivered Barr\u2019s letter to the relevant House and Senate committees and senior congressional leaders, officials said.\n\nOne official described the report as \u201ccomprehensive\u201d but added that very few people have seen it.\n\nEven with the report\u2019s filing, Mueller is expected to retain his role as special counsel for a wind-down period, though it is unclear how long that may last, officials said. A small number of his staffers will remain in the office to help shut down the operations.\n\n\u201cThe investigation is complete,\u201d Kupec said.\n\nTwo of the president\u2019s attorneys, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Jay Sekulow, said in a joint statement: \u201cWe\u2019re pleased that the Office of Special Counsel has delivered its report to the Attorney General pursuant to the regulations. Attorney General Barr will determine the appropriate next steps.\u201d\n\nGiuliani said he did not know whether he would get a briefing this weekend on the report\u2019s contents.\n\nWell before its completion, Mueller\u2019s report was a hotly debated topic. Lawmakers sought to wrest guarantees from the Justice Department that the special counsel would give a complete public accounting of what he found during the nearly two-year inquiry.\n\nAccording to Justice Department regulations, the special counsel\u2019s report should explain Mueller\u2019s decisions \u2014 who was charged, who was investigated but not charged, and why.\n\nMueller\u2019s work consumed Washington and at times the country as the special counsel and his team investigated whether any Trump associates conspired with Russian officials to interfere in the election.\n\nIt is unclear how much of what Mueller found will be disclosed in Barr\u2019s summary for Congress. Congressional Democrats, anticipating an incomplete accounting, have already sent extensive requests to the Justice Department for documents that would spell out what Mueller discovered.\n\nFive people close to the president have pleaded guilty:Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort; former deputy campaign manager Rick Gates; former national security adviser Michael Flynn; former personal attorney Michael Cohen; and former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos.\n\nA sixth, Trump\u2019s longtime friend Roger Stone, was indicted in January and accused of lying to Congress. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nMore than two dozen of the people charged by Mueller are Russians, and because the United States does not have an extradition treaty with Russia, they are unlikely ever to see the inside of a U.S. courtroom.\n\nNone of the Americans charged by Mueller are accused of conspiring with Russia to interfere in the election \u2014 the central question of Mueller\u2019s work. Instead, they pleaded guilty to various crimes, including lying to the FBI.\n\nThe investigation ended without charges for a number of key figures who had long been under Mueller\u2019s scrutiny, including conservative writer Jerome Corsi, who said Friday that he felt \u201cvindicated\u201d by the development.\n\nCorsi met with prosecutors repeatedly about communications he had before the November 2016 election with Stone about the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks. In November, Corsi took the unorthodox step of publishing draft court documents Mueller\u2019s team had provided to him as they urged him to plead guilty to lying in an October 2018 debriefing. He said that his memory had been faulty but that he had not intentionally lied, and he refused to take the deal.\n\n\u201cThey lost. They tried to give me a plea deal that was a lie and I exposed it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey wisely left me alone. Seven months through absolute hell when all I did was try to cooperate.\u201d\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s investigation was launched May 17, 2017, in a moment of crisis for the FBI, the Justice Department and the country.\n\n[Mueller appointed special counsel]\n\nDays earlier, Trump had fired FBI Director James B. Comey. The purported reason was Comey\u2019s handling of the 2016 investigation of former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, but Trump said in an interview with NBC News shortly after the firing that he was thinking about the Russia inquiry when he decided to remove Comey.\n\nComey\u2019s firing set off alarms in the Justice Department and in Congress, where lawmakers feared the president was determined to end the Russia investigation before it was completed.\n\nAfter then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation, Rosenstein chose Mueller as special counsel in part to quell the burgeoning political crisis.\n\nMueller\u2019s team pursued a number of investigative tracks, including whether the president\u2019s behavior leading up to and after Comey\u2019s firing amounted to an attempt to obstruct justice.\n\n[Who\u2019s been charged in Mueller-linked probes, and why]\n\nAs the investigation proceeded, Republican opposition to Mueller\u2019s work grew, encouraged in part by the president\u2019s repeated declarations that the investigation was a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nWhile those fights raged on, Mueller said virtually nothing. In part because of this silence, political factions tended to say almost anything they wanted about his work. Republicans in the House Freedom Caucus called it a money-wasting farce; Democrats touted every new investigative step as further evidence that the probe was so serious that Trump\u2019s days as president could be numbered.\n\nIn 2018, Mueller\u2019s office took direct aim at Moscow. Thirteen Russians were charged as part of an online \u201ctroll farm\u201d accused of sowing political division and distrust among Americans via social media. Five months later, Mueller\u2019s office indicted a dozen Russian military intelligence officials, saying they conspired to hack into Democrats\u2019 computer accounts and publicize the stolen files.\n\nLast year, much of Mueller\u2019s time and energy was focused on the question of obstruction. Whether Trump or his senior advisers had sought to stop or cripple the Russia inquiry was a key reason that Mueller\u2019s job as special counsel existed in the first place.\n\nProving a suspect\u2019s intent is an important element of any obstruction case, and there was one witness Mueller was never able to get in a room: Trump. After negotiating for months, the president\u2019s attorneys agreed to submit written answers to questions from the special counsel. Ultimately, Mueller and the Justice Department did not serve the president with a subpoena, which could have led to a fight at the Supreme Court.\n\nBarr\u2019s letter to Congress revealed Mueller\u2019s superiors never rejected an investigative step he wanted to take \u2014 meaning Mueller never formally sought permission to subpoena the president.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, Mueller and his team continued to hold the vague threat of a subpoena over Trump\u2019s attorneys up until December, insisting they had to interview Trump to complete their work. Up until January, Mueller\u2019s team had sought to have Trump answer additional questions.\n\nRosalind S. Helderman, Ellen Nakashima, Carol D.

    "text": "Cedar Rapids, Iowa (CNN) Beto O'Rourke said Friday night that he had been wrong for joking at several events in his first two days campaigning in Iowa that his wife has been raising their three children \"sometimes with my help.\"\n\nThe former congressman from Texas, who launched his bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination Thursday, addressed the remarks during a recording of the podcast Political Party LIVE! in Cedar Rapids. The comments triggered complaints from Democratic operatives and activists, many of them women, that female candidates could never similarly joke about their roles raising their children.\n\n\"Not only will I not say that again, but I'll be more thoughtful going forward in the way that I talk about our marriage, and also the way in which I acknowledge the truth of the criticism that I have enjoyed white privilege,\" he said.\n\nHe pointed to his ability to walk away from two arrests as a young man without serious consequences as a example.\n\n\"So yes, I think the criticism is right on. My ham-handed attempt to try to highlight the fact that Amy has the lion's share of the burden in our family -- that she actually works but is the primary parent in our family, especially when I served in Congress, especially when I was on the campaign trail -- should have also been a moment for me to acknowledge that that is far too often the case, not just in politics, but just in life in general. I hope as I have been in some instances part of the problem, I can also be part of the solution,\" he said.\n\nRead More"

    "text": "I. The Wisdom of Friends The clinic permitted Paul Manafort one 10-minute call each day. And each day, he would use it to ring his wife from Arizona, his voice often soaked in tears. \u201cApparently he sobs daily,\u201d his daughter Andrea, then 29, texted a friend. During the spring of 2015, Manafort\u2019s life had tipped into a deep trough. A few months earlier, he had intimated to his other daughter, Jessica, that suicide was a possibility. He would \u201cbe gone forever,\u201d she texted Andrea. To hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app. His work, the source of the status he cherished, had taken a devastating turn. For nearly a decade, he had counted primarily on a single client, albeit an exceedingly lucrative one. He\u2019d been the chief political strategist to the man who became the president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, with whom he\u2019d developed a highly personal relationship. Manafort would swim naked with his boss outside his banya, play tennis with him at his palace (\u201cOf course, I let him win,\u201d Manafort made it known), and generally serve as an arbiter of power in a vast country. One of his deputies, Rick Gates, once boasted to a group of Washington lobbyists, \u201cYou have to understand, we\u2019ve been working in Ukraine a long time, and Paul has a whole separate shadow government structure \u2026 In every ministry, he has a guy.\u201d Only a small handful of Americans\u2014oil executives, Cold War spymasters\u2014could claim to have ever amassed such influence in a foreign regime. The power had helped fill Manafort\u2019s bank accounts; according to his recent indictment, he had tens of millions of dollars stashed in havens like Cyprus and the Grenadines. Manafort had profited from the sort of excesses that make a country ripe for revolution. And in the early months of 2014, protesters gathered on the Maidan, Kiev\u2019s Independence Square, and swept his patron from power. Fearing for his life, Yanukovych sought protective shelter in Russia. Manafort avoided any harm by keeping a careful distance from the enflamed city. But in his Kiev office, he\u2019d left behind a safe filled with papers that he would not have wanted to fall into public view or the wrong hands. Money, which had always flowed freely to Manafort and which he\u2019d spent more freely still, soon became a problem. After the revolution, Manafort cadged some business from former minions of the ousted president, the ones who hadn\u2019t needed to run for their lives. But he complained about unpaid bills and, at age 66, scoured the world (Hungary, Uganda, Kenya) for fresh clients, hustling without any apparent luck. Andrea noted her father\u2019s \u201ctight cash flow state,\u201d texting Jessica, \u201cHe is suddenly extremely cheap.\u201d His change in spending habits was dampening her wedding plans. For her \u201cwedding weekend kick off\u201d party, he suggested scaling back the menu to hot dogs and eliminated a line item for ice.\n\nHe seemed unwilling, or perhaps unable, to access his offshore accounts; an FBI investigation scrutinizing his work in Ukraine had begun not long after Yanukovych\u2019s fall. Meanwhile, a Russian oligarch named Oleg Deripaska had been after Manafort to explain what had happened to an $18.9 million investment in a Ukrainian company that Manafort had claimed to have made on his behalf. Manafort had been dodging Deripaska. The Russian oligarch wanted to know what had become of his money. Manafort had known Deripaska for years, so he surely understood the oligarch\u2019s history. Deripaska had won his fortune by prevailing in the so-called aluminum wars of the 1990s, a corpse-filled struggle, one of the most violent of all the competitions for dominance in a post-Soviet industry. In 2006, the U.S. State Department had revoked Deripaska\u2019s visa, reportedly out of concern over his ties to organized crime (which he has denied). Despite Deripaska\u2019s reputation, or perhaps because of it, Manafort had been dodging the oligarch\u2019s attempts to contact him. As Deripaska\u2019s lawyers informed a court in 2014 while attempting to claw back their client\u2019s money, \u201cIt appears that Paul Manafort and Rick Gates have simply disappeared.\u201d Nine months after the Ukrainian revolution, Manafort\u2019s family life also went into crisis. The nature of his home life can be observed in detail because Andrea\u2019s text messages were obtained last year by a \u201chacktivist collective\u201d\u2014most likely Ukrainians furious with Manafort\u2019s meddling in their country\u2014which posted the purloined material on the dark web. The texts extend over four years (2012\u201316) and 6 million words. Manafort has previously confirmed that his daughter\u2019s phone was hacked and acknowledged the authenticity of some texts quoted by Politico and The New York Times. Manafort and Andrea both declined to comment on this article. Jessica could not be reached for comment.\n\nCollectively, the texts show a sometimes fraught series of relationships, by turns loving and manipulative. Manafort was generous with his family financially\u2014he\u2019d invested millions in Jessica\u2019s film projects, and millions more in her now-ex-husband\u2019s real-estate ventures. But when he called home in tears or threatened suicide in the spring of 2015, he was pleading for his marriage. The previous November, as the cache of texts shows, his daughters had caught him in an affair with a woman more than 30 years his junior. It was an expensive relationship. According to the text messages, Manafort had rented his mistress a $9,000-a-month apartment in Manhattan and a house in the Hamptons, not far from his own. He had handed her an American Express card, which she\u2019d used to good effect. \u201cI only go to luxury restaurants,\u201d she once declared on a friend\u2019s fledgling podcast, speaking expansively about her photo posts on social media: caviar, lobster, haute cuisine. The affair had been an unexpected revelation. Manafort had nursed his wife after a horseback-riding accident had nearly killed her in 1997. \u201cI always marveled at how patient and devoted he was with her during that time,\u201d an old friend of Manafort\u2019s told me. But after the exposure of his infidelity, his wife had begun to confess simmering marital issues to her daughters. Manafort had committed to couples therapy but, the texts reveal, that hadn\u2019t prevented him from continuing his affair. Because he clumsily obscured his infidelity\u2014and because his mistress posted about their travels on Instagram\u2014his family caught him again, six months later. He entered the clinic in Arizona soon after, according to Andrea\u2019s texts. \u201cMy dad,\u201d she wrote, \u201cis in the middle of a massive emotional breakdown.\u201d\n\nBy the early months of 2016, Manafort was back in greater Washington, his main residence and the place where he\u2019d begun his career as a political consultant and lobbyist. But his attempts at rehabilitation\u2014of his family life, his career, his sense of self-worth\u2014continued. He began to make a different set of calls. As he watched the U.S. presidential campaign take an unlikely turn, he saw an opportunity, and he badly wanted in. He wrote Donald Trump a crisp memo listing all the reasons he would be an ideal campaign consigliere\u2014and then implored mutual friends to tout his skills to the ascendant candidate. Shortly before the announcement of his job inside Trump\u2019s campaign, Manafort touched base with former colleagues to let them know of his professional return. He exuded his characteristic confidence, but they surprised him with doubts and worries. Throughout his long career, Manafort had advised powerful men\u2014U.S. senators and foreign supreme commanders, imposing generals and presidents-for-life. He\u2019d learned how to soothe them, how to bend their intransigent wills with his calmly delivered, diligently researched arguments. But Manafort simply couldn\u2019t accept the wisdom of his friends, advice that he surely would have dispensed to anyone with a history like his own\u2014the imperative to shy away from unnecessary attention. His friends, like all Republican political operatives of a certain age, could recite the legend of Paul Manafort, which they did with fascination, envy, and occasional disdain. When Manafort had arrived in Washington in the 1970s, the place reveled in its shabby glories, most notably a self-satisfied sense of high duty. Wealth came in the form of Georgetown mansions, with their antique imperfections and worn rugs projecting power so certain of itself, it needn\u2019t shout. But that old boarding-school establishment wasn\u2019t Manafort\u2019s style. As he made a name for himself, he began to dress differently than the Brooks Brothers crowd on K Street, more European, with funky, colorful blazers and collarless shirts. If he entertained the notion, say, of moving his backyard swimming pool a few feet, nothing stopped him from the expense. Colleagues, amused by his sartorial quirks and his cosmopolitan lifestyle, referred to him as \u201cthe Count of Monte Cristo.\u201d\n\nHis acts of rebellion were not merely aesthetic. Manafort rewrote the rules of his adopted city. In the early \u201980s, he created a consulting firm that ignored the conventions that had previously governed lobbying. When it came to taking on new clients, he was uninhibited by moral limits. In 2016, his friends might not have known the specifics of his Cyprus accounts, all the alleged off-the-books payments to him captured in Cyrillic ledgers in Kiev. But they knew enough to believe that he could never sustain the exposure that comes with running a presidential campaign in the age of opposition research and aggressive media. \u201cThe risks couldn\u2019t have been more obvious,\u201d one friend who attempted to dissuade him from the job told me. But in his frayed state, these warnings failed to register. When Paul Manafort officially joined the Trump campaign, on March 28, 2016, he represented a danger not only to himself but to the political organization he would ultimately run. A lifetime of foreign adventures didn\u2019t just contain scandalous stories, it evinced the character of a man who would very likely commandeer the campaign to serve his own interests, with little concern for the collective consequences. Over the decades, Manafort had cut a trail of foreign money and influence into Washington, then built that trail into a superhighway. When it comes to serving the interests of the world\u2019s autocrats, he\u2019s been a great innovator. His indictment in October after investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller alleges money laundering, false statements, and other acts of personal corruption. (He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.) But Manafort\u2019s role in Mueller\u2019s broader narrative remains carefully guarded, and unknown to the public. And his personal corruption is less significant, ultimately, than his lifetime role as a corrupter of the American system. That he would be accused of helping a foreign power subvert American democracy is a fitting coda to his life\u2019s story.\n\nII. The Young Man and His Machine In the spring of 1977, a 28-year-old Paul Manafort sat at a folding table in a hotel suite in Memphis. Photos from that time show him with a Tom Selleck mustache and meaningful sideburns. He was surrounded by phones that he\u2019d specially installed for the weekend. The desk held his copious binders, which he called \u201cwhip books.\u201d Eight hundred delegates had gathered to elect a new leader of the Young Republicans organization, and Manafort, a budding kingmaker, had compiled a dossier on each one. Those whip books provided the basis for deal making. To wheedle and cajole delegates, it helped to have an idea of what job they wanted in return for their support. Control over the Young Republicans\u2014a political and social network for professionals ages 18 to 40\u2014was a genuine prize in those days. Presidential hopefuls sought to harness the group. This was still the era of brokered presidential conventions, and Young Republicans could descend in numbers sufficient to dominate the state meetings that selected delegates. In 1964, the group\u2019s efforts had arguably secured Barry Goldwater the GOP nomination; by the \u201970s every Republican aspirant understood its potency. The attention paid by party elders yielded opportunities for Young Republican leaders. Patronage flowed in their direction. To seize the organization was to come into possession of a baby Tammany. In Memphis, Manafort was working on behalf of his friend Roger Stone, now best known as a pioneer in opposition research and a promiscuous purveyor of conspiracy theories. He managed Stone\u2019s candidacy for chairman of the group. Stone, then 24, reveled in the fact that he\u2019d received his political education during Richard Nixon\u2019s reelection campaign in 1972; he even admitted to playing dirty tricks to benefit his idol. Stone and Manafort had met through College Republicans. They shared a home state, an affection for finely tailored power suits, and a deeper love of power itself. Together, they campaigned with gleeful ruthlessness.\n\nEven at this early stage in his career, Manafort had acquired a remarkable skill for managing a gathering of great size. He knew how to command an army of loyalists, who took his orders via walkie-talkie. And he knew how to put on a show. In Memphis that year, he rented a Mississippi River paddleboat for a booze cruise and dispatched his whips to work over wavering delegates within its floating confines. To the Young Republican elite, the faction Manafort controlled carried a name that conveyed his expectation of unfailing loyalty: the Team. And in the face of the Team\u2019s prowess, Stone\u2019s rival eventually quit the race, mid-convention. \u201cIt\u2019s all been scripted in the back room,\u201d he complained. Manafort had been bred for politics. While he was in high school, his father, Paul Manafort Sr., became the mayor of New Britain, Connecticut, and Manafort Jr. gravitated toward the action\u2014joining a mock city council, campaigning for the gubernatorial candidate Thomas Meskill as part of his Kiddie Corps. For college and law school, he chose Georgetown University, a taxi ride from the big time. In the \u201970s, the big time was embodied by James A. Baker III, the shrewdest Republican insider of his generation. During the epic Republican National Convention of 1976, Manafort holed up with Baker in a trailer outside the Kemper Arena, in Kansas City, Missouri. They attempted to protect Gerald Ford\u2019s renomination bid in the face of Ronald Reagan\u2019s energetic challenge; Manafort wrangled delegates on Baker\u2019s behalf. From Baker, he learned the art of ostentatious humility, how to use the knife to butter up and then stab in the back. \u201cHe was studying at the feet of the master,\u201d Jeff Bell, a Reagan campaign aide, remembers.\n\nBy the late \u201970s, Manafort and Stone could foresee Ronald Reagan\u2019s ascendance, and both intended to become players in his 1980 campaign. For Manafort, this was an audacious volte-face. By flipping his allegiance from the former Ford faction, he provoked suspicion among conservatives, who viewed him as a rank opportunist. There was little denying that the Young Republicans made an ideal vehicle for his ambitions. These ambitions left a trail of damage, including an Alabama lawyer named Neal Acker. During the Memphis convention, Acker had served as a loyal foot soldier on the Team, organizing the southern delegates on Stone\u2019s behalf. In return, Manafort and Stone had promised to throw the Team behind Acker\u2019s campaign to replace Stone as the head of the Young Republicans two years later, in 1979. Manafort would manage the campaign himself. But as the moment of Acker\u2019s coronation approached, Manafort suddenly conditioned his plan. If Acker wanted the job, he had to swear loyalty to Reagan. When Acker ultimately balked\u2014he wanted to stay neutral\u2014Manafort turned on him with fury, \u201can unprecedented 11th-hour move,\u201d the Associated Press reported. In the week leading up to the 1979 Young Republicans convention, Manafort and Stone set out to destroy Acker\u2019s candidacy. At Manafort\u2019s urging, the delegates who were pledged to Acker bolted\u2014and Manafort took over his opponent\u2019s campaign. In a bravura projection of power that no one in the Reagan campaign could miss, Manafort swung the vote sharply against Acker, 465 to 180. \u201cIt was one of the great fuck jobs,\u201d a Manafort whip told me recently.\n\nNot long after that, Stone and Manafort won the crucial positions in the Reagan operation that they\u2019d coveted. Stone directed the campaign in the Northeast, Manafort in the South. The campaign had its share of infighting; both men survived factional schisms and purges. \u201cThey were known as the Young Republican whizzes,\u201d Jeff Bell told me. Their performance positioned them for inner-sanctum jobs in the Reagan administration, but they had even grander plans. III. The Firm During the years that followed World War II, Washington\u2019s most effective lobbyists transcended the transactional nature of their profession. Men such as Abe Fortas, Clark Clifford, Bryce Harlow, and Thomas Corcoran were known not as grubby mercenaries but as elegant avatars of a permanent establishment, lauded as \u201cwise men.\u201d Lobbying hardly carried a stigma, because there was so little of it. When the legendary lawyer Tommy Boggs registered himself as a lobbyist, in 1967, his name was only 64th on the active list. Businesses simply didn\u2019t consider lobbying a necessity. Three leading political scientists had studied the profession in 1963 and concluded: \u201cWhen we look at the typical lobby, we find its opportunities to maneuver are sharply limited, its staff mediocre, and its typical problem not the influencing of Congressional votes but finding the clients and contributors to enable it to survive at all.\u201d On the cusp of the Reagan era, Republican lobbyists were particularly enfeebled. Generations of Democratic majorities in Congress had been terrible for business. The scant tribe of Republican lobbyists working the cloakrooms included alumni of the Nixon and Ford administrations; operating under the shame-inducing cloud of Watergate, they were disinclined toward either ambition or aggression.\n\nThis was the world that brash novices like Manafort and Stone quickly came to dominate. The Reagan administration represented a break with the old Republican establishment. After the long expansion of the regulatory state, business finally had a political partner eager to dismantle it\u2014which generated unprecedented demand for lobbyists. Manafort could convincingly claim to know the new administration better than anyone. During its transition to power, he was the personnel coordinator in the Office of Executive Management, which meant that he\u2019d stacked the incoming government with his people.* Along with Stone and Charlie Black, another veteran of the Young Republican wars, he set up a firm, Black, Manafort and Stone, which soon compiled an imposing client list: Bethlehem Steel, the Tobacco Institute, Johnson & Johnson, Trans World Airlines. Whereas other firms had operated in specialized niches\u2014lobbying, consulting, public relations\u2014Black, Manafort and Stone bundled all those services under one roof, a deceptively simple move that would eventually help transform Washington. Time magazine deemed the operation \u201cthe ultimate supermarket of influence peddling.\u201d Fred Wertheimer, a good-government advocate, described this expansive approach as \u201cinstitutionalized conflict of interest.\u201d The linkage of lobbying to political consulting\u2014the creation of what\u2019s now known as a double-breasted operation\u2014was the real breakthrough. Manafort\u2019s was the first lobbying firm to also house political consultants. (Legally, the two practices were divided into different companies, but they shared the same founding partners and the same office space.) One venture would run campaigns; the other would turn around and lobby the politicians whom their colleagues had helped elect. The consulting side hired the hard-edged operative Lee Atwater, notorious for pioneering race-baiting tactics on behalf of Strom Thurmond. \u201cWe\u2019re getting into servicing what we sell,\u201d Atwater told his friends. Just as imagined, the firm\u2019s political clients (Jesse Helms, Phil Gramm, Arlen Specter) became reliable warhorses when the firm needed them to promote the agendas of its corporate clients. With this evolution of the profession, the effectiveness and influence of lobbying grew in tandem.\n\nIn 1984, the firm reached across the aisle. It made a partner of Peter Kelly, a former finance chairman of the Democratic National Committee, who had earned the loyalty of lawmakers by raising millions for their campaigns. Some members of the firm worked for Democratic Senate candidates in Louisiana, Vermont, and Florida, even as operatives down the hall worked for their Republican foes. \u201cPeople said, \u2018It\u2019s un-American,\u2019 \u201d Kelly told me. \u201c \u2018They can\u2019t lose. They have both sides.\u2019 I kept saying, \u2018How is it un-American to win?\u2019 \u201d This sense of invincibility permeated the lobbying operation too. When Congress passed tax-reform legislation in 1986, the firm managed to get one special rule inserted that saved Chrysler-Mitsubishi $58 million; it wrangled another clause that reaped Johnson & Johnson $38 million in savings. Newsweek pronounced the firm \u201cthe hottest shop in town.\u201d Manafort\u2019s lobbying firm exuded the decadent spirit of the \u201980s. \u201cExcess Is Best\u201d was the theme of one annual gathering. Demand for its services rose to such heights that the firm engineered a virtual lock on the 1988 Republican primary. Atwater became the chief strategist for George H. W. Bush; Black worked with Bob Dole; Stone advised Jack Kemp. A congressional staffer joked to Time, \u201cWhy have primaries for the nomination? Why not have the candidates go over to Black, Manafort and Stone and argue it out?\u201d Manafort cultivated this perception. In response to a questionnaire in The Washington Times, he declared Machiavelli the person he would most like to meet.\n\nDespite his young age, Manafort projected the sort of confidence that inspires others to have confidence, a demeanor often likened to that of a news anchor. \u201cHe is authoritative, and you never see a chink in the armor,\u201d one of his longtime deputies, Philip Griffin, told me. Manafort wrote well, especially in proposals to prospective clients, and excelled at thinking strategically. Name-dropping never substituted for concrete steps that would bolster a client. \u201cIf politics has done anything, it\u2019s taught us to treat everything as a campaign,\u201d he once declared. He toiled for clients with unflagging intensity. His wife once quipped, according to the text messages, that Andrea was conceived between conference calls. He \u201chung up the phone, looked at his watch, and said, \u2018Okay, we have 20 minutes until the next one,\u2019 \u201d Andrea wrote to her then-fianc\u00e9. The firm exuded the decadent spirit of the 1980s. Each year, it hosted a golf outing called Boodles, after the gin brand. \u201cIt would have to move almost every year, because we weren\u2019t invited back,\u201d John Donaldson, an old friend of Manafort\u2019s who worked at the firm, says. \u201cA couple of women in the firm complained that they weren\u2019t ever invited. I told them they didn\u2019t want to be.\u201d As the head of the firm\u2019s \u201csocial committee,\u201d Manafort would supply a theme for the annual gatherings. His masterwork was a three-year progression: \u201cExcess,\u201d followed by \u201cExceed Excess,\u201d capped by \u201cExcess Is Best.\u201d\n\nPartners at the firm let it be known to The Washington Post that they each intended to take home at least $450,000 in 1986 (a little more than $1 million today). \u201cAll of a sudden they came into a lot of money, and I don\u2019t think any of them were used to earning the money that we were earning,\u201d Kelly said. Senior partners were given luxury cars and a membership to the country club of their choosing. Manafort would fly the Concorde to Europe and back as if it were the Acela to New York. \u201cI must confess,\u201d Atwater swooned to The Washington Post, \u201cafter four years on a government payroll, I\u2019m delighted with my new life style.\u201d The firm hired kids straight out of college\u2014\u201cwheel men\u201d in the office vernacular\u2014to drive the partners around town. When Roger Stone\u2019s old hero, Richard Nixon, came to Washington, the wheel men would shuttle him about. Many of these young associates would eventually climb the firm\u2019s ladder, and were often dispatched to manage campaigns on the firm\u2019s behalf. Climbing the ladder, however, in most cases required passing what came to be known as Manafort\u2019s \u201cloyalty tests\u201d\u2014challenging tasks that strayed outside the boundaries of standard professional commitment and demonstrated the control that Manafort expected to exert over the associates\u2019 lives. At the last minute, he might ask a staffer to entertain his visiting law-school buddies, never mind that the staffer had never met them before. For one Saint Patrick\u2019s Day party, he gave two junior staffers 24 hours to track down a plausible impersonator of Billy Barty, the 3-foot-9-inch actor who made movies with Mickey Rooney and Chevy Chase\u2014which they did. \u201cThis was in the days before the internet,\u201d one of them told me. \u201cCan you imagine how hard that was?\u201d\n\nIV. Man of the World By the 1990s, the double-digit list of registered lobbyists that Tommy Boggs had joined back in 1967 had swelled to more than 10,000. Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly had greatly abetted that transformation, and stood to profit from the rising flood of corporate money into the capital. But by then, domestic politics had begun to feel a little small, a bit too unexotic, for Paul Manafort, whom Charlie Black described to me as a self-styled \u201cadventurer.\u201d Manafort had long befriended ambitious young diplomats at the trailhead to power, including Prince Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud, then the Saudi ambassador to Washington. When Bandar attended the 1984 Republican National Convention, Manafort dedicated a small group of advance men to smooth his way. Manafort arranged for Bandar to arrive at the presidential entrance, then had him whisked to seats in the vice-presidential box. Foreign lobbying had certainly existed before the \u201980s, but it was limited in scale and operated under a penumbra of suspicion. Just before World War II, Congress had passed the Foreign Agents Registration Act, largely in response to the campaigns orchestrated by Ivy Lee, an American publicist hired by the German Dye Trust to soften the image of the Third Reich. Congress hadn\u2019t outlawed influence peddling on behalf of foreign interests, but the practice sat on the far fringes of K Street. Paul Manafort helped change that. The Reagan administration had remade the contours of the Cold War, stepping up the fight against communism worldwide by funding and training guerrilla armies and right-wing military forces, such as the Nicaraguan contras and the Afghan mujahideen. This strategy of military outsourcing\u2014the Reagan Doctrine\u2014aimed to overload the Soviet Union with confrontations that it couldn\u2019t sustain.\n\nAll of the money Congress began spending on anti-communist proxies represented a vast opportunity. Iron-fisted dictators and scruffy commandants around the world hoped for a share of the largesse. To get it, they needed help refining their image, so that Congress wouldn\u2019t look too hard at their less-than-liberal tendencies. Other lobbyists sought out authoritarian clients, but none did so with the focused intensity of Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly. The firm would arrange for image-buffing interviews on American news programs; it would enlist allies in Congress to unleash money. Back home, it would help regimes acquire the whiff of democratic legitimacy that would bolster their standing in Washington. The firm won clients because it adeptly marketed its ties to the Reagan administration, and then the George H. W. Bush administration after that. In one proposal, reported in The New York Times in 1988, the firm advertised its \u201cpersonal relationships\u201d with officials and promised to \u201cupgrade\u201d back channels \u201cin the economic and foreign policy spheres.\u201d No doubt it helped to have a friend in James Baker, especially after he became the secretary of state under Bush. \u201cBaker would send the firm clients,\u201d Kelly remembered. \u201cHe wanted us to help lead these guys in a better direction.\u201d But moral improvement never really figured into Manafort\u2019s calculus. \u201cGenerally speaking, I would focus on how to bring the client in sync with western European or American values,\u201d Kelly told me. \u201cPaul took the opposite approach.\u201d (Kelly and Manafort have not spoken in recent years; the former supported Hillary Clinton in the last presidential campaign.) In her memoir, Riva Levinson, a managing director at the firm from 1985 to 1995, wrote that when she protested to her boss that she needed to believe in what she was doing, Manafort told her that it would \u201cbe my downfall in this business.\u201d The firm\u2019s client base grew to include dictatorial governments in Nigeria, Kenya, Zaire, Equatorial Guinea, Saudi Arabia, and Somalia, among others. Manafort\u2019s firm was a primary subject of scorn in a 1992 report issued by the Center for Public Integrity called \u201cThe Torturers\u2019 Lobby.\u201d\n\nThe firm\u2019s international business accelerated when the Philippines became a client, in 1985. President Ferdinand Marcos desperately needed a patina of legitimacy: The 1983 assassination of the chief opposition leader, Benigno Aquino Jr., had imperiled U.S. congressional support for his regime. Marcos hired Manafort to lift his image; his wife, Imelda, personally delivered an initial payment of $60,000 to the firm while on a trip to the States. When Marcos called a snap election to prove his democratic bona fides in 1986, Manafort told Time, \u201cWhat we\u2019ve tried to do is make it more of a Chicago-style election and not Mexico\u2019s.\u201d The quip was honest, if unintentionally so. In the American political lexicon, Chicago-style elections were generally synonymous with mass voter fraud. The late pollster Warren Mitofsky traveled to the Philippines with CBS News to set up and conduct an exit poll for the election. When he returned, he told the political scientist Sam Popkin the story of how a representative of Manafort\u2019s firm had asked him, \u201cWhat sort of margin might make a Marcos victory legitimate?\u201d The implication was clear, Popkin told me: \u201cHow do we rig this thing and still satisfy the Americans?\u201d The firm\u2019s most successful right-wing makeover was of the Angolan guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi, a Maoist turned anti-communist insurgent, whose army committed atrocities against children and conscripted women into sexual slavery. During the general\u2019s 1986 trip to New York and Washington, Manafort and his associates created what one magazine called \u201cSavimbi Chic.\u201d Dressed in a Nehru suit, Savimbi was driven around in a stretch limousine and housed in the Waldorf-Astoria and the Grand Hotel, projecting an image of refinement. The firm had assiduously prepared him for the mission, sending him monthly reports on the political climate in Washington. According to The Washington Post, \u201cHe was meticulously coached on everything from how to answer his critics to how to compliment his patrons.\u201d Savimbi emerged from his tour as a much-championed \u201cfreedom fighter.\u201d When the neoconservative icon Jeane Kirkpatrick introduced Savimbi at the American Enterprise Institute, she declared that he was a \u201clinguist, philosopher, poet, politician, warrior \u2026 one of the few authentic heroes of our time.\u201d\n\nThis was a racket\u2014Savimbi paid the firm $600,000 in 1985 alone\u2014that Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly did its best to keep alive; the firm\u2019s own business was tied to Savimbi\u2019s continued rebellion against Angola\u2019s leftist regime. As the country stood on the brink of peace talks in the late \u201980s, after nearly 15 years of bloody civil war, the firm helped secure fresh batches of arms for its client, emboldening Savimbi to push forward with his military campaign. Former Senator Bill Bradley wrote in his memoir, \u201cWhen Gorbachev pulled the plug on Soviet aid to the Angolan government, we had absolutely no reason to persist in aiding Savimbi. But by then he had hired an effective Washington lobbying firm.\u201d The war continued for more than a decade, killing hundreds of thousands of Angolans. V. The Family Business \u201cPaul\u2019s not especially ideological,\u201d his former partner Charlie Black told me recently. Many of Manafort\u2019s colleagues at Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly professed to believe in the conservative catechism. Words like freedom and liberty flowed through their everyday musings. But Manafort seldom spoke of first principles or political ideals. He descends from a different kind of political lineage, and in his formative experience one can see the makings of his worldview. Back in the \u201960s, Manafort\u2019s hometown, New Britain, Connecticut, was known as Hardware City. It housed the factory that turned out Stanley tools and was a tangle of ethnic enclaves\u2014Poles, Italians, Irish, Ukrainians. Nancy Johnson, who served New Britain in Congress, told me that when she arrived in the city during those years, she couldn\u2019t believe how little it interacted with the outside world. \u201cIt was a small city and very ingrown. When my kids were in high school, the number of their classmates who hadn\u2019t been to Hartford was stunning.\u201d Hartford, the state capital, is a 15-minute drive from New Britain.\n\nIn 1919, not long after the Manaforts emigrated from Naples, the family founded a demolition company, New Britain House Wrecking, which eventually became Manafort Brothers, a force in local construction. When Manafort\u2019s father, Paul Sr., ran for mayor in 1965, he was a lonely Republican attempting to seize a blue bastion. But he had the schmoozing gene, as well as an unmistakable fierceness. Paul Carver, a former New Britain City Council member and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the old man, told me, \u201cIt was like going to the bar with your grandfather. He would stick his hand out and buy a round of drinks. He knew almost everybody in town.\u201d Paul Jr., known as P.J. to his friends, idolized his dad, plunging himself into the campaign, whose success he would decades later describe as \u201cmagic.\u201d Over the years, he would remain a devoted son. All the partners in his firm came to know his father, running into him at parties that P.J. hosted in his Mount Vernon, Virginia, home. \u201cHe was dedicated to him,\u201d Nancy Johnson told me. The elder Manafort\u2019s outsize capacity for charm made him the sort of figure whose blemishes tend to be wiped from public memory. But in 1981, he was charged with perjury for testimony that he had provided in a municipal corruption investigation. New Britain police had been accused of casting a blind eye toward illegal gambling in the city\u2014and of tampering with evidence to protect Joseph \u201cPippi\u201d Guerriero, a member of the DeCavalcante crime family.\n\nSeveral investigations into the tampering drilled through New Britain\u2019s rotten government. The most devastating report came from Palmer McGee, a Hartford lawyer hired by New Britain to sort through its muck. In his findings, he pointed a finger straight at Manafort Sr., calling him the person \u201cmost at fault.\u201d According to the testimony of a whistle-blower, Manafort had flatly announced that he wanted to hire someone \u201cflexible\u201d to manage his personnel office, a place that would \u201cnot [be] 100 percent by the rules.\u201d The whistle-blower also testified that he had delivered an envelope to Manafort\u2019s home containing the answers to the exam that aspiring police officers had to pass\u2014and that Manafort had given it to two candidates via a relative. Manafort never denied receiving the envelope but insisted that he\u2019d merely asked for \u201cboning-up materials.\u201d A statute of limitations precluded prosecutors from filing charges against Manafort for the alleged crime of test-fixing\u2014and ultimately he was never convicted of perjury. But his arrest caused the Hartford Courant to compile a list of dealings that reflected badly on him: \u201cThroughout his more than twenty years in public life, he has been the focus of controversy, and several accusations of wrongdoing.\u201d The litany includes a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development accusing him of steering contracts to Manafort Brothers, whose stock he still owned while mayor. When investors from Florida built a jai alai arena in Bridgeport\u2014using the Teamsters\u2019 pension fund to finance the project\u2014Manafort had \u201cimproperly\u201d finagled its environmental permit. His family business had then inflated the fees for its work on the arena so that cash could be kicked back to the Teamsters. (The business admitted to inflating its fees, but a grand jury declined to issue an indictment.) Even before this scandal broke, a former mayor of New Britain blasted Manafort for behavior that \u201cviolates the very essence of morality.\u201d\n\nConventional wisdom suggests that the temptations of Washington, D.C., corrupt all the idealists, na\u00effs, and ingenues who settle there. But what if that formulation gets the causation backwards? What if it took an outsider to debase the capital and create the so-called swamp? When Paul Manafort Jr. broke the rules, when he operated outside of a moral code, he was really following the example he knew best. As he later said of his work with his father in an interview with a local Connecticut paper, \u201cSome of the skills that I learned there I still use today \u2026 That\u2019s where I cut my teeth.\u201d VI. Al Assir By the late 1980s, Manafort had a new friend from abroad, whom he mentioned to his partners more than any other, an arms dealer from Lebanon named Abdul Rahman Al Assir. \u201cHis name kept popping up,\u201d Peter Kelly remembered. While Al Assir never rated much attention in the American press, he had a familial connection who did. He was, for a time, the brother-in-law of the Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, the middleman used in the arms-for-hostages scheme that became the Iran-Contra scandal. In the early \u201980s, Khashoggi was worth $4 billion; his biography, published in 1986, was titled The Richest Man in the World. At the height of his wealth, Khashoggi spent $250,000 a day to maintain his lifestyle\u2014which reportedly included a dozen houses, 1,000 suits, a $70 million yacht, and a customized airplane, which has been described as a \u201cflying Las Vegas discotheque.\u201d\n\nAl Assir was the Khashoggi empire\u2019s representative in Spain and a broker of big weapons sales to African armies. He\u2019d ensconced himself among the rich and famous, the set that skied in Gstaad, Switzerland, and summered in the south of France. The London-based Arabic-language magazine Sourakia wrote, \u201cThe miracle of Al Assir is that he will have lunch with Don Juan Carlos [the king of Spain], dinner with Hassan II [the king of Morocco], and breakfast the next day with Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez [the prime minister of Spain].\u201d Manafort suggested to his partners that Al Assir might help connect the firm to clients around the world. He wanted to increase the firm\u2019s global reach. Manafort\u2019s exploration of the outermost moral frontiers of the influence business had already exposed him to kleptocrats, thugs, and other dubious characters. But none of these relationships imprinted themselves more deeply than his friendship and entrepreneurial partnership with Al Assir. By the \u201990s, the two had begun to put together big deals. One of the more noteworthy was an arms sale they helped broker between France and Pakistan, lubricated by bribes and kickbacks involving high-level officials in both countries, that eventually led to murder allegations. The arms dealer Al Assir introduced Manafort to an aristocratic world that exceeded anything he had ever known. It all arguably began with a 1993 dinner hosted by Manafort in his Virginia home and attended by Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. Bhutto had just returned to power after three years in the opposition, and Manafort badly wanted her business. She knew of him as a skilled manipulator of public opinion, and throughout the meal, Manafort displayed his most strategic, most charming self. One former Pakistani official who attended the dinner told me that Bhutto came away determined to make use of his services. She suggested that Manafort work with the Pakistani intelligence service. Spooks in Islamabad had observed the international rush to hire Washington lobbyists, and they had been clamoring for one of their own. At about that same time, Pakistan was looking to upgrade its submarine fleet, and European arms contractors raced to hawk their wares. In the end, France\u2019s state-owned manufacturer won the contract\u2014and Al Assir was added as an intermediary at the last minute. An ensuing scandal that is still unfolding, some 20 years later, would entangle both Al Assir and Manafort. It entailed alleged kickbacks into the 1995 presidential campaign of \u00c9douard Balladur, apparently arranged by the French defense minister. Al Assir seems to have been a key conduit of the kickbacks. Years later, in 2002, a car bomb went off in Karachi, killing 11 French naval engineers in transit to the shipyard where the submarines were being assembled, along with three Pakistanis. One theory, fervently supported by some of the engineers\u2019 families, holds that the bombing was orchestrated by Pakistani officials who were disgruntled that the bribes promised to them as part of the deal had never arrived. Manafort was not a central figure in this scandal, and was never charged with any wrongdoing. But as the former Pakistani official told me, \u201cHe was an introducer\u2014and he received a fee for his part.\u201d Documents show that Manafort earned at least $272,000 as a consultant to the Balladur campaign, although, as Manafort later conceded to French investigators, it was Al Assir who actually paid him. (Balladur has denied any wrongdoing and doesn\u2019t recall Manafort working for him. Al Assir could not be reached for comment on this story.) Manafort and Al Assir were more than business partners. \u201cThey were very brotherly,\u201d one mutual acquaintance of theirs told me. Manafort took Al Assir as his guest to George H. W. Bush\u2019s inauguration, in 1989. When Al Assir and his second wife had a child, Manafort became the godfather. Their families vacationed together near Cannes. Al Assir introduced Manafort to an aristocratic world that exceeded anything he had ever known. \u201cThere\u2019s money, and there\u2019s really big money,\u201d a friend of Manafort\u2019s told me. \u201cPaul became aware of the difference between making $300,000 and $5 million. He discovered the south of France. Al Assir would show him how to live that life.\u201d Colleagues at Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly noticed changes that accompanied the flowering of the friendship. Manafort\u2019s sartorial style began to pay homage to Al Assir, with flourishes of the European dandy. Suddenly he started wearing unconventional shirts and suede loafers without socks. In the firm\u2019s early years, Manafort had been a fixture of the office, a general presiding over his headquarters. But now he frequently flew off to France or Spain, collaborating with Al Assir on projects that remained a mystery to his subordinates, and even to his partners. \u201cPaul went off on different foreign things that none of us knew about,\u201d Peter Kelly told me. Manafort\u2019s lifestyle came to feature opulent touches that stood out amid the relative fustiness of Washington. When Andrea expressed an interest in horseback riding, Manafort bought a farm near Palm Beach, then stocked it with specially bred horses imported from Ireland, which required a full-time staff to tend. John Donaldson, Manafort\u2019s friend, recalls, \u201cHe was competing with the Al Assirs of the world\u2014and he wanted to live in that lifestyle.\u201d There were always suspicions among Manafort\u2019s colleagues in the firm that he was making money for himself without regard for his partners. Al Assir\u2019s occasional appearance in the international press lent these suspicions weight. One deal brokered by Al Assir helped crash a private bank in Lisbon. In 2002, he and Manafort persuaded the bank to invest 57 million euros in a Puerto Rican biometrics company. According to reporting by the Portuguese newspaper Observador, Manafort was the lead American investor in the company; his involvement helped justify the bank\u2019s investment, despite evidence of the company\u2019s faulty products and lax accounting. Al Assir is alleged to have extracted bloated commissions from the deal and to have pocketed some of the bank\u2019s loans. Manafort reportedly made $1.5 million selling his shares of the biometrics firm before the company eventually came tumbling down. Stories about Manafort\u2019s slipperiness have acquired mythic status. In the summer of 2016, Politico\u2019s Kenneth Vogel, now with The New York Times, wrote a rigorous exegesis of a long-standing rumor: Manafort was said to have walked away with $10 million in cash from Ferdinand Marcos, money he promised he would deliver to Ronald Reagan\u2019s reelection campaign (which itself would have been illegal). Vogel relied in part on the 1996 memoir of Ed Rollins, a Republican consultant and Reagan\u2019s reelection-campaign director. In the book, Rollins recounted a dinner-party conversation with a member of the Filipino congress who claimed to have personally given a suitcase of cash to a \u201cwell-known Washington power lobbyist\u201d involved in the Marcos campaign. Rollins would neither confirm nor deny that the lobbyist was Manafort, though his description doesn\u2019t leave much uncertainty, and he conceded in an email that \u201cit\u2019s a pretty good guess.\u201d Rollins admits in his book to being \u201cstunned\u201d by what he heard\u2014\u201cnot in a state of total disbelief, though, because I knew the lobbyist well and I had no doubt the money was now in some offshore bank.\u201d This irked Rollins greatly: \u201cI ran the [Reagan] campaign for $75,000 a year, and this guy got $10 million in cash.\u201d Manafort has always denied Rollins\u2019s insinuation\u2014\u201cold stuff that never had any legs,\u201d he told Vogel. And as a practical matter, it\u2019s hard to imagine that anyone could stuff $10 million in a suitcase. Still, Vogel found a raft of circumstantial evidence that suggested the plausibility of the tale. When I asked Manafort\u2019s former colleagues about the apocrypha, they couldn\u2019t confirm the story. But some didn\u2019t struggle to imagine it might be true, either. Even though John Donaldson doubts the veracity of the tale, he told me that it persists because it reflects Manafort\u2019s ethics. \u201cI know how Paul would view it. Paul would sit there and say, \u2018These guys can\u2019t get access to Reagan. I can get them access to Reagan. They want to give $10 million to Reagan. Reagan can\u2019t take $10 million. I\u2019ll take the $10 million. They think they\u2019ll be getting their influence. Everybody\u2019s happy.\u2019 \u201d Another alumnus of Manafort\u2019s firm answered my questions about the Marcos money with an anecdote. After the election of George H. W. Bush, Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly agreed to help organize the inauguration festivities. The firm commissioned a company from Rhode Island to sell memorabilia on the parade route\u2014T-shirts, buttons, and the like. After crews had taken down the reviewing stand and swept up the debris, the alumnus recalled, a vendor showed up in the office with a bag full of cash. To the disbelief of his colleague, Manafort had arranged to take his own cut. \u201cIt was a Paul tax,\u201d the former employee told me. \u201cI guess he needed a new deck. But this was classic: Somebody else does the work, and he walks away with the bag of cash.\u201d Having spent so much time in the company of oligarchs, Manafort decided to become one himself. Colleagues suspected the worst about Manafort because they had observed his growing mania for accumulating property, how he\u2019d bought second, third, and fourth homes. \u201cHe would buy a house without ever seeing it,\u201d one former colleague told me. His Hamptons estate came with a putting green, a basketball court, a pool, and gardens. \u201cHe believed that suckers stay out of debt,\u201d the colleague told me. His unrestrained spending and pile of debt required a perpetual search for bigger paydays and riskier ventures. In 1991, Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly was purchased by the mega public-affairs firm Burson-Marsteller, the second-largest agency in the world. It was a moment of consolidation in the industry, where the biggest players came to understand how much money could be made from the model that Manafort had created. But nearly as soon as Burson acquired the firm, Tom Bell, the head of its Washington office, began to notice the ways in which Manafort hadn\u2019t played by the rules. He\u2019d been operating as a freelancer, working on projects that never went to the bottom line. In 1995, Manafort left Burson. Taking a handful of colleagues with him, he started a new firm\u2014Davis, Manafort and Freedman\u2014and a new chapter, one that would see him enter the sphere of the Kremlin. VII. The Master of Kiev During the 1980s and \u201990s, an arms dealer had stood at the pinnacle of global wealth. In the new century, post-Soviet oligarchs climbed closer to that position. Manafort\u2019s ambitions trailed that shift. His new firm found its way to a fresh set of titans, with the help of an heir to an ancient fortune. In 2003, Rick Davis, a partner in Manafort\u2019s new firm, was invited to the office of a hedge fund in Midtown Manhattan. The summons didn\u2019t reveal the name of the man requesting his presence. When Davis arrived, he found himself pumping the hand of the Honorable Nathaniel Philip Victor James Rothschild, the British-born financier known as Nat. Throughout his young career, Nat had fascinated the London press with his love interests, his residences, and his shrewd investments. For his 40th birthday, he threw himself a legendary party in the Balkan state of Montenegro, which reportedly cost well over $1 million\u2014a three-day festival of hedonism, with palm trees imported from Uruguay. Russian oligarchs were drawn to Rothschild, whose name connoted power\u2014and he to them. \u201cHe likes this wild world,\u201d Anders \u00c5slund, a friend of Rothschild\u2019s, told me. Rothschild invested heavily in post-communist economies and became a primary adviser (and a friend) to the young Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska. Rothschild and Deripaska fed off each other\u2019s grand ambitions. Like a pair of old imperialists, they imagined new, sympathetic governments across eastern Europe that would accommodate and protect their investments. Their project required the type of expertise that Manafort had spent years accumulating. In 2004, Rothschild hired Manafort\u2019s new firm to resurrect the influence of an exiled Georgian politician, a former KGB operative and friend of Deripaska\u2019s then living in Moscow. This made for a heavy lift because the operative had recently been accused in court as a central plotter in a conspiracy to assassinate the country\u2019s president, Eduard Shevardnadze. (He denied involvement.) The rehabilitation scheme never fully developed, but a few years later, Rick Davis triumphantly managed a referendum campaign that resulted in the independence of Montenegro\u2014an effort that Deripaska funded with the hope of capturing the country\u2019s aluminum industry. Deripaska\u2019s interests were not only financial. He was always looking to curry favor with the Russian state. An August 2007 email sent by Lauren Goodrich, an analyst for the global intelligence firm Stratfor, and subsequently posted on WikiLeaks, described Deripaska boasting to her about how he had set himself up \u201cto be indispensable to Putin and the Kremlin.\u201d This made good business sense, since he had witnessed the Kremlin expropriate the vast empires of oligarchs such as Mikhail Khodorkovsky who\u2019d dared to challenge Putin. In fact, the Kremlin came to consider Deripaska an essential proxy. When the United States denied Deripaska a visa, the Russians handed him a diplomatic passport, which permitted him to make his way to Washington and New York. Manafort understood how highly Deripaska valued his symbiotic relationship with the Kremlin. According to the Associated Press, he pitched a contract in 2005, proposing that Deripaska finance an effort to \u201cinfluence politics, business dealings and news coverage inside the United States, Europe and former Soviet Republics to benefit President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government.\u201d (Deripaska says he never took Manafort up on this proposal.) The Kremlin\u2019s grip on its old Soviet sphere was especially precarious in the early aughts. President George W. Bush\u2019s democratic agenda espoused an almost messianic sense of how the United States could unleash a new age of freedom. The grandiloquent American rhetoric posed an existential threat to entrenched rulers of the region who were friendly to Russia, and who had become rich by plundering state resources. Suddenly, the threat of democratic revolution no longer felt theoretical. The risks of popular uprising were very much on Rothschild\u2019s and Deripaska\u2019s minds during the last months of 2004, when they handed Manafort a specific task. Ukraine had descended into political crisis, one that jeopardized business interests they\u2019d already developed in the country (Rothschild had various private-equity investments; Deripaska had an aluminum smelter). They sent Manafort to Kiev to understand how they might minimize the dangers. Of all Paul Manafort\u2019s foreign adventures, Ukraine most sustained his attention, ultimately to the exclusion of his other business. The country\u2019s politics are hardly as simple as commonly portrayed; corruption extends its tentacles into all the major parties. Still, the narrative of Manafort\u2019s time in Ukraine isn\u2019t terribly complicated. He worked on behalf of a clique of former gangsters from the country\u2019s east, oligarchs who felt linguistic and cultural affinity to Russia, and who wanted political control of the entire nation. When Manafort arrived, the candidate of this clique, Viktor Yanukovych, was facing allegations that he had tried to rig the 2004 presidential election with fraud and intimidation, and possibly by poisoning his opponent with dioxin. He lost the election anyway, despite having imported a slew of consultants from Moscow. After that humiliating defeat, Yanukovych and the oligarchs who\u2019d supported him were desperate for a new guru.\n\nBy the time Manafort first entertained the possibility of working with Yanukovych, the defeated candidate had just returned to Kiev following a brief self-imposed exile at a Czech resort. They met at an old movie palace that had been converted into the headquarters for his political organization, the Party of Regions. When Manafort entered the grandiose building, the place was a mausoleum and Yanukovych a pariah. \u201cPeople avoided him,\u201d Philip Griffin said. \u201cHe was radioactive.\u201d Manafort groomed Yanukovych to resemble, well, himself. \u00c5slund, who had advised the Ukrainian government on economic policy, told me, \u201cYanukovych and Manafort are almost exactly the same size. So they are big, tall men. He got Yanukovych to wear the same suits as he did and to comb the hair backwards as he does.\u201d Yanukovych had been wooden in public and in private, but \u201cManafort taught him how to smile and how to do small talk.\u201d And he did it all quietly, \u201cfrom a back seat. He did it very elegantly.\u201d He also directed Yanukovych\u2019s party to harp on a single theme each week\u2014say, the sorry condition of pensioners. These were not the most-sophisticated techniques, but they had never been deployed in Ukraine. Yanukovych was proud of his American turn. After he hired Manafort, he invited U.S. Ambassador John Herbst to his office, placed a binder containing Manafort\u2019s strategy in front of him, and announced, \u201cI\u2019m going with Washington.\u201d Manafort often justified his work in Ukraine by arguing that he hoped to guide the country toward Europe and the West. But his polling data suggested that Yanukovych should accentuate cultural divisions in the country, playing to the sense of victimization felt by Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine. And sure enough, his clients railed against nato expansion. When a U.S. diplomat discovered a rabidly anti-American speech on the Party of Regions\u2019 website, Manafort told him, \u201cBut it isn\u2019t on the English version.\u201d Yanukovych\u2019s party succeeded in the parliamentary elections beyond all expectations, and the oligarchs who\u2019d funded it came to regard Manafort with immense respect. As a result, Manafort began spending longer spans of time in Ukraine. One of his greatest gifts as a businessman was his audacity, and his Ukrainian benefactors had amassed enormous fortunes. The outrageous amounts that Manafort billed, sums far greater than any he had previously received, seemed perfectly normal. An associate of Manafort\u2019s described the system this way: \u201cPaul would ask for a big sum,\u201d Yanukovych would approve it, and then his chief of staff \u201cwould go to the other oligarchs and ask them to kick in. \u2018Hey, you need to pay a million.\u2019 They would complain, but Yanukovych asked, so they would give.\u201d When Yanukovych won the presidency in 2010, he gave Manafort \u201cwalk in\u201d privileges, allowing him to stroll into the inner sanctum of the presidential offices at any time. Yanukovych could be bullheaded, and as his presidency progressed, he increasingly cut himself off from advisers. Manafort, however, knew how to change Yanukovych\u2019s mind, using polling and political arguments to make his case. Oleg Voloshyn, a former spokesman in the foreign-affairs ministry, told me that his own boss, the foreign minister, eventually turned to Manafort to carry messages and make arguments regarding foreign-policy priorities on his behalf. \u201cYanukovych would listen to him,\u201d Voloshyn told me, \u201cwhen our arguments were ignored.\u201d VIII. A Reversal of Fortune Before everything exploded in Ukraine, Manafort saw the country as his golden land, the greatest of his opportunities. But his role as adviser, as powerful as it was, never quite matched his own buccaneering sense of self. After spending so much time in the company of Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs, he set out to become an oligarch himself. Rick Davis declared their firm to be mostly \u201cin the deal business,\u201d according to James Harding\u2019s 2008 book, Alpha Dogs: The Americans Who Turned Political Spin Into a Global Business. \u201cThe thing I love,\u201d Davis said, \u201cis that the political elites and the economic elites in every other country but the United States of America are the same.\u201d The elected officials and the people \u201crunning the elections are the richest people in the country, who own all the assets.\u201d In 2006, Rick Gates, who\u2019d begun as a wheel man at the old firm, arrived in Kiev. (Gates did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this article.) Manafort placed him at the helm of a new private-equity firm he\u2019d created called Pericles. He intended to raise $200 million to bankroll investments in Ukraine and Russia. \u201cIt was a virgin market in virtually any industry you wanted to pick up,\u201d Philip Griffin told me. Manafort had always intended to rely on financing from Oleg Deripaska to fund Pericles. In 2007, Manafort persuaded him to commit $100 million to the project, a sum that would have hardly made a dent in the oligarch\u2019s fortune. On the eve of the 2008 global financial crisis, he was worth $28 billion. Deripaska handed his money to Paul Manafort because he trusted him. Manafort repeatedly traveled to the oligarch\u2019s Moscow office, where they would sit for hours and tour the business and political horizon of the former Eastern Bloc. Deripaska had become a billionaire in his 30s, and acquired the noisy pretensions of young wealth. He wanted to become the global face of Russia, he said. But that would require overcoming the reputation that stalked him, and Manafort could help. In 2001, before Manafort and Deripaska met, the World Economic Forum in Davos had withdrawn its invitation to the oligarch, as a court examined his alleged misdeeds in the course of erecting his empire. (The case was eventually dismissed.) Five years after the Davos rejection, Rick Davis shepherded Deripaska around the elite confab, taking him to a party brimming with U.S. senators, including John McCain. For Pericles\u2019s first deal, Manafort used Deripaska\u2019s money to buy a telecommunications firm in Odessa called Chorne More (\u201cBlack Seas,\u201d in English) at a cost of $18.9 million. He also charged a staggering $7.35 million in management fees for overseeing the venture. But months after the Chorne More purchase, the 2008 financial crisis hit, gutting Deripaska\u2019s net worth. It plummeted so far that he needed a $4.5 billion bailout from the Russian state bank to survive. The loan included an interest payment in the form of abject humiliation: Putin traveled to one of Deripaska\u2019s factories and berated him on television. As Deripaska\u2019s world came crashing down, his representatives asked Manafort to liquidate Pericles and give him back his fair share. Manafort had little choice but to agree. But that promise never translated to action. An audit of Chorne More that Rick Gates said was under way likewise never materialized. Then, in 2011, Manafort stopped responding to Deripaska\u2019s investment team altogether. Deripaska wouldn\u2019t let go of the notion that Manafort owed him money. In 2015, his lawyers filed a motion in a Virginia court. They wanted the authority to track down more information on the deal, even though the initial papers for it had been filed in the Cayman Islands. The lawyers had already managed to get their hands on some of the documentation surrounding the deal, and they had extracted a belated explanation of what had happened from Gates. According to a spokeswoman for Deripaska, Gates said that Chorne More had defaulted on a $1 million loan that it had taken out to pay for capital expenditures, allegedly forfeiting the partnership\u2019s entire investment in the process. This explanation struck Deripaska\u2019s lawyers as wildly implausible. Deripaska began to publicly doubt whether Manafort had even bought the telecommunications company in the first place. \u201cAt present it seems that the Partnership never acquired any of the Chorne More entities,\u201d his lawyers argued. All of the papers for the initial deal had included Rick Davis\u2019s name. They suggested that he would serve as Manafort\u2019s partner, and that shares would be divided evenly between the two. But Davis knew nothing of the Chorne More deal. While Manafort had been putting together Pericles, Davis had been on leave from Davis, Manafort and Freedman, running John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. Because Davis\u2019s connections to Manafort and Deripaska had caused him a public-relations headache at the outset of the campaign, he\u2019d kept a healthy distance from both men. When Deripaska\u2019s lawyers asked him about the money he supposedly owed their client, Davis was gobsmacked. He soon discovered that Manafort had also registered a new company\u2014Davis Manafort International\u2014to continue trading on the old firm\u2019s name, while cutting him out of consulting fees. Upon returning from the campaign, and witnessing the extent to which Manafort had abused his trust, Davis left the firm they had created together.\n\nMark Peterson / Redux"

    "text": "A Texas woman who mistakenly voted illegally in the 2016 presidential election has been sentenced an additional 10 months to her five-year sentence.\n\nCrystal Mason claims that she did not fully understand the terms of her probation following a fraud conviction in 2011, USA Today reports. According to Texas law, people convicted of felonies cannot vote, the Dallas Morning News reports. But convicts can have their voting rights restored after they have completed their full sentence, including probation.\n\nWhen Mason showed up at the polling station, she says that her name was not on the voter role. Instead, she was granted a provisional ballot, for which she had to sign an affidavit that included a requirement that she was not.\n\nAccording to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Mason said she did not carefully read the form because an election official was helping her.\n\nHer story failed to convince the Tarrant County District Judge Ruben Gonzalez that Mason did not know that she could not vote, even with Mason\u2019 probation officer testifying that he did not notify her of that fact. Casting a vote illegally is considered a second-degree felony that is punishable by up to 20 years in prison.\n\nIn March, she was sentenced to five years for the actual voting. But she has been given an additional 10 months for violating her probation, the terms of her release for a felony conviction, that have now earned her the additional 10 months, the Huffington Post reports.\n\nMason says that she did not even want to vote that day, but her mother insisted, she told the Star-Telegram.\n\n\u201cYou think I would jeopardize my freedom? You honestly think I would ever want to leave my babies again?\u201d she said.\n\nMason is scheduled to surrender to custody on Sept. 13."

    "text": "\n\nCrystal Mason (Tarrant County Jail)\n\nIf she had known it was illegal, Crystal Mason said she would have never cast a vote in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe 43-year-old former tax preparer hadn\u2019t even planned on voting until her mother encouraged her to do it. She had only recently been released from federal prison for a 2012 tax fraud conviction, in which she pleaded guilty to inflating returns for her clients, her attorney, J. Warren St. John, told The Washington Post.\n\nShe was still on community supervision at the time of the election \u2014 but no one, including her probation officer, St. John said, ever told her that being a felon on supervision meant she couldn\u2019t vote under Texas law.\n\nNow, she\u2019s going back to prison for casting a ballot illegally \u2014 for five years.\n\nMason was indicted on a charge of illegal voting in Tarrant County, Tex., last year and found guilty by State District Judge Ruben Gonzalez on Thursday, despite her protestations that she simply was not aware that she was barred from casting a ballot and never would have done it had she known.\n\nAs she told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram at the time she was indicted: \u201cYou think I would jeopardize my freedom? You honestly think I would ever want to leave my babies again? That was the hardest thing in my life to deal with. Who would \u2014 as a mother, as a provider \u2014 leave their kids over voting?\u201d\n\nThe case is yet another illustration of Texas\u2019s zealous crackdown on voter fraud, a problem that state GOP leaders have described as \u201crampant\u201d in the past but for which they have yet to provide hard proof, save for isolated cases such as Mason\u2019s.\n\nIn a 2016 ruling rejecting Texas\u2019s stringent voter ID law, which state lawmakers had pitched as a way to stop voter fraud, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit found only two convictions for in-person voter fraud out of 20 million ballots cast in the years before the 2011 passage of the law.\n\nWhile in-person voter fraud is considered extremely rare, mail-in voter fraud is less so. In 2016, Dallas County had to sequester roughly 700 suspicious mail-in ballots for a city council race after receiving complaints from voters, who received mail-in ballots they didn\u2019t request.\n\nStill, after the 2016 general election, President Trump assembled a now-defunct \u201cvoter fraud commission\u201d amid his baseless claims that millions of people voted illegally. Texas\u2019s pursuit of in-person voter fraud reflected the Trump administration\u2019s zeal.\n\nIn February 2017, another woman in Tarrant County, a Mexican national with a green card, was sentenced to eight years in prison after falsely claiming to be a U.S. citizen on her ballot. According to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Rosa Maria Ortega, a mother of four, testified that she had confused the difference between rights granted to legal permanent resident and to a U.S. citizen, which a jury did not buy. She had voted as a Republican in elections in 2012 and 2014.\n\n\u201cThis case shows how serious Texas is about keeping its elections secure, and the outcome sends a message that violators of the state\u2019s election law will be prosecuted to the fullest,\u201d Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said after Ortega was sentenced. \u201d\n\nSt. John said he believes that Mason\u2019s five-year prison sentence, for what he said was an honest mistake, is a direct result of such rhetoric from Paxton\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cShe voted in good faith. She showed who she was. Everything was truthful,\u201d St. John said. \u201cJust like she said in court, \u2018Why would I want to jeopardize all the work I did to get out of prison, go to the halfway house and get back to my family, if I knew voting was going to get me into prison?\u201d\n\nOn the day of the presidential election, Nov 8., 2016, Mason arrived at her polling place to find that her name wasn\u2019t on the voter roll, St. John said.\n\nAn election worker offered to help, he said, and presented her with a provisional ballot, which allows a person to cast a vote as long as they certify they are eligible by signing an affidavit. Small print at the top asks the voter to certify that if she is a felon, she has fully completed her sentence, including supervision or parole of any kind. Mason tried to explain to the judge that, since an election worker was helping her, she was not reading carefully, which, St. John said, failed to sway him.\n\nUltimately, her vote didn\u2019t even count. Provisional ballots are subject to review, which ultimately led to an investigation of Mason.\n\nSt. John said he has already filed an appeal, hoping to keep his client out of prison so she can remain with her family. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that a \u201cchorus of small children\u201d waved goodbye to her as a bailiff led her back to jail, saying, \u201cBye-bye, Big Mama.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever vote again,\u201d she told the news outlet after her indictment. \u201cThat\u2019s being honest. I\u2019ll never vote again.\u201d\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nKirbyjon Caldwell, famed Houston megachurch pastor, sold millions in worthless bonds, feds charge\n\nAustin police chief changes mind, labels bombing suspect a \u2018domestic terrorist\u2019\n\n\u2018Landmark ruling\u2019: A woman is sent to prison in South Africa for using racial epithet"

    "title": "Desi Arnaz\u2019s 102nd Birthday",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Today\u2019s Doodle celebrates the life and legacy of Desi Arnaz, the Cuban-born American actor, musician, comedian, and producer best known for playing Ricky Ricardo in the 1950s hit sitcom I Love Lucy.\n\nDesiderio Alberto Arnaz III was born in Santiago, Cuba on March 2, 1917, where he spent his childhood before immigrating to the United States during the Cuban Revolution. After arriving in America without a penny to his name, the young Arnaz worked hard to eventually find success as a musician. A major turning point in his career came after he landed a role in the 1939 Broadway production Too Many Girls as well as a film adaptation of the same play just one year later. It was on this set that he met his co-star, future wife, and lifelong friend Lucille Ball.\n\nIn 1950, after advancing his career as both an actor and a musician, both Arnaz and Ball pitched CBS on what would eventually become the hit American TV sitcom I Love Lucy. Network executives were initially concerned that Arnaz\u2019s accent would affect his credibility as Ball\u2019s husband, so the pair produced a pilot with their own money, ultimately winning support for the creation of the show.\n\nI Love Lucy ran from 1951 to 1957 and was the most popular TV show in America for four of its six prime-time seasons. At one point, it attracted an estimated 44 million viewers for a single episode\u2014more than watched the inauguration of President Eisenhower! As part of their production deal, Arnaz and Ball retained all rights to the content, enabling them to sell the series into syndication.\n\nToday, Arnaz is widely considered a trailblazer in the American entertainment industry, even being credited with inventing the rerun. In 1956 he won a Golden Globe for Best Television Achievement, an award which recognized his impact on American comedy both in front AND behind the camera. He was also awarded not one, but two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to both Television and Motion Pictures.\n\nHere\u2019s to Desi Arnaz, whose beaming joy and laughter continues to bring delight to living rooms and viewers around the globe.\n\n\n\nSpecial thanks to the family of Desi Arnaz, particularly Lucie Arnaz Luckinbill and Desi Arnaz, Jr., for their partnership on this project. Below, they share their thoughts on the Doodle and their father\u2019s legacy:\n\nWe could not be more thrilled that Google is honoring our father with this Doodle on what would have been his 102nd birthday. He first came to the U.S. in 1933 as a 16-year-old penniless immigrant seeking asylum from a revolution in Cuba which destroyed his family\u2019s home and belongings as well as imprisoned his father. Barely speaking English upon his arrival, he quickly utilized his raw musical talent and innate business sense to begin his ascent in the world of entertainment. His humble beginnings included cleaning bird cages to buy another guitar, and he eventually formed the first Latin band in Miami, introduced the Conga dance craze to the U.S., and was cast in a hit Broadway musical before heading to Hollywood to act in films.\n\nDad went on to marry his first film co-star Lucille Ball, and their combined genius created I Love Lucy and formed Desilu Studios. The two quickly became the most iconic duo in American television history. Because of his strategy to put I Love Lucy on film in front of a live audience, almost 70 years later, fans all over the world are still able to enjoy not only this revolutionary TV comedy, but all others that have since been produced using Desilu\u2019s groundbreaking techniques.\n\n\n\nAs his family, we have wonderful memories of him as a Dad and a Grandpa. At home, he was a great cook and entertainer. He loved to create laughter and filled our home with music and fun. He loved spending time with us in the pool and showing us each and every sunset. Wherever we went, he was the leader and we were his band. But he also had his personal struggles. Because of pains too deep to reach, he struggled with alcohol addiction later in life and a love of cigarillos, which eventually caused him to leave us way too soon. He lived life with enormous passion. He was incredibly generous. He was likable. He was fallible. He was human.\n\n\n\nWe are so proud that he is being recognized for his talent and his gifts of entertainment. Desiderio Alberto Arnaz III was a one-of-a-kind innovator and trailblazer, and we wish he could have lived to see this special acknowledgment of the lasting contributions he gave to the world.\n\nExplore how Desi Arnaz pioneered the TV sitcom as we know it today through a story on his life on Google Arts & Culture, featuring photographs from the LIFE Photo Collection."

Johnson called the move \u201csuper-creepy and inappropriate,\u201d telling the Post she \u201cimmediately felt violated.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders dismissed Johnson\u2019s accusation as \u201cabsurd on its face,\u201d insisting her claim is \u201cdirectly contradicted by multiple highly credible eye witness accounts.\u201d One of those \u201chighly credible eye witness accounts\u201d is Florida attorney general Pam Bondi.\n\nAt the time, Johnson told her boyfriend, mother and stepfather about Trump\u2019s actions, and all three confirmed her report to the Post. She also contacted an attorney two months after the event, and a therapist who, \u201cwhose notes, which The Post reviewed, reference an unspecified event during the campaign that had left her distraught.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s suit also claims that as a black woman, she was paid less than her white male counterparts. Campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany called that accusation \u201coff-base and unfounded.\u201d\n\nRead the full report at the Washington Post."

    "text": "It began as a lighthearted moment. Senator Kamala Harris, the California Democrat and former prosecutor who announced her presidential candidacy last month, revealed on a popular radio show this week that she had smoked marijuana during her college years at Howard University in Washington.\n\nBut after a viral tweet ignited backlash from marijuana activists and conservatives, Ms. Harris faces accusations that she fabricated parts of her story. In the midst of answering simultaneous questions about what music she listens to, she appeared to some to say she listened to rap artists like Tupac and Snoop Dogg as she smoked in college, though neither released an album until after she graduated.\n\nConservative news outlets feasted on what they portrayed as an embarrassing gaffe, with the popular morning show \u201cFox & Friends\u201d even dedicating a segment to it Wednesday morning. Less partisan media outlets also publicized the supposed controversy, with some alleging that it was further proof Ms. Harris, who is likely the most viable black woman ever to run for president, was playing up parts of her identity in order to impress black voters."

But enshrining them in the Constitution is our responsibility.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Milano has pushed for ratifying the ERA \u2014 she testified at a shadow hearing last year on the same issue.\n\nCongress approved the ERA in 1972, but only 35 states \u2014 three short of the number required to add it to the Constitution \u2014 ratified it ahead of the deadline.\n\nOther states have ratified it since, though a measure in the Virginia state legislature to make it the 38th state to do so failed last week.\n\nConstitutional amendments must be approved by two-thirds of both the U.S. House and Senate and ratified by three-fourths of the 50 states.\n\nCongress\u2019s deadline to secure the ERA expired in 1982.\n\n\u201cWe have waited too long. We cannot wait another century, another decade, another year, or another month. We need constitutional protection for women,\u201d Arquette, 50, said.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear,\u201d Milano, 46, said during her remarks, \u201cequality if not an issue of party. It\u2019s not an issue of politics. It\u2019s an issue of basic human dignity.\u201d\n\nThe pair of Hollywood performers stood alongside Democratic Reps.

    "text": "One-year-old twins Adelaide and Gray Carter were recently diagnosed with a neuromuscular disease that is usually fatal \u2014 the treatment costs: $750,000 per child. To cope with that financial burden, their parents are seeking help from the same place used by thousands of other Americans facing crushing medical expenses: the internet.\n\nThe children's father, Jarod Carter, has started a GoFundMe page that to date has raised more than $103,000. He is by no means alone. Roughly 250,00 campaigns for dealing with health care costs are set up annually on the online fundraising platform, raising total contributions of $650 million per year, according to GoFundMe.com.\n\nOne-third of the donations made through the site help people pay for medical care, according to CEO Rob Solomon.\n\n\"When we started in 2010, it wasn't purposefully set up and built to be a substitute for medical insurance,\" Solomon told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We weren't ever set up to be a health care company and we still are not. But over time, people have used GoFundMe for the most important issues they are faced with.\"\n\nOne-year-old twins Adelaide and Gray Carter, who both have a potentially fatal neurosmuscular disease. Their parents have used GoFundMe to raise money to help pay for their medical care and related expenses. Jarod Carter\n\nHealth coverage has eroded since 2017, with 7 million more Americans becoming uninsured since President Donald Trump took office, according to recent Gallup data. The national uninsured rate stands at 13.7 percent, a four-year high, according to the report.\n\nPages of sick people\n\nJust a few of the many thousands of other GoFundMe pages set up to help people raise money to deal with health care issues:\n\nA 31-year-old mother twice diagnosed with ovarian cancer\n\n\n\nAn 8-year-old boy facing high drug costs following a 2018 heart transplant\n\n\n\nA 3-year-old girl with a rare kind of brain cancer\n\nA mom fighting leukemia\n\nA U.S. Air Force officer battling cancer\n\nA teenage boy diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder\n\nWhy do hospital bills get so expensive?\n\nWhile many pages on the site are for people who lack health insurance, others have coverage but still face major costs. Carter, a 40-year-old physical therapist with his own practice in Austin, Texas, said the family's insurer, Aetna, \"has been really great to us.\" But the ancillary expenses of looking after his children are heavy.\n\n\"Now our son is on a ventilator, and for both of them they have a higher likelihood -- if they get a cold or flu or anything at all \u2014 of needing to go to the hospital. So even getting really good cleaning materials is an expense.\"\n\n\"There are all these things we need to get to make sure these kids have the best chance of staying healthy,\" he added. \"That is never going to be fully covered even if you have best insurance in the world.\"\n\n\"Take action\"\n\nGoFundMe helps people raise money for a range of purposes. Its millions of users create fundraisers that fall under categories including family, education, competition, creative, travel, faith and more.\n\n\"We have turned into this 'take action' button, whether it's related to the government shutdown or a family member who can't pay their medical bills \u2014 people want to help, and we actually solve big problems,\" Solomon said. \"While we didn't set out to be one of the most influential health care companies in the world, if we have to serve that purpose, I feel very proud about that.\"\n\nStill he laments the fact that so many Americans are challenged by \"the rising costs of a broken health care system.\"\n\n\"A crowdfunding platform can not and should not be a solution to complex, systemic problems that must be solved with meaningful public policy,\" he said.\n\nAre patients being misled as hospitals post medical costs required by federal rule?\n\nAlthough many Americans still lack health insurance, the trend in raising money online to pay for medical costs isn't limited to the U.S. Medical fundraisers are also popular in countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom, which have universal health care. Even when medical bills are covered, associated costs including lost wages, transportation and hotel bills can drain people's bank accounts.\n\n\"Medical-related fundraisers tend to be the largest category in any market,\" Solomon said. \"Insurance may cover the medical payment side of it, but it doesn't cover you being out of work or needing transportation or lodging away from your home. So it is still a very big category in every market.\""

    "text": "It is hardly controversial to say that right-wing extremism is on the rise. The Anti-Defamation League has reported a 35 percent rise in the number of murders committed by right-wing extremists in the last year, and we can all clearly see what\u2019s going on around us, on the internet and elsewhere. What has been controversial, however, is the way this rise has been covered in certain media outlets. There\u2019s the school of thought that bigots should never be put on television or be personally interviewed for articles, because doing so gives them a platform to spread their hate, along with the attention they crave. Others think that it must be covered because it\u2019s a newsworthy issue, and that \u201csunshine is the best disinfectant.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s my school of thought, which is that sunshine can be a great disinfectant, but that the gentle, flattering lighting of a private interview room on The Today Show simply doesn\u2019t provide it. The problem isn\u2019t that it\u2019s being done at all, but that it isn\u2019t being done well.\n\nAs someone who has covered right-wing extremism since well before Charlottesville, I\u2019ve given a lot of thought to where these types of interviews go wrong, and what can be done to make them actually effective in terms of making people understand the seriousness of radicalization in America without suggesting that these assholes or their ideas be taken seriously. And what I keep coming back to is the old-school daytime talk shows.\n\nSay what you will about these shows\u2014that they were trashy, that they were exploitative, that they were fanatically obsessed with yelling at women who wore \u201cslutty\u201d clothes, that in many cases they didn\u2019t really know what the hell they were even doing other than getting high ratings\u2014but you probably never came away from one unsure of who the \u201cvillain\u201d was supposed to be.\n\n\n\nWhen Today interviewed Nick Sandmann this week, the show did so in good faith. It allowed him 15 minutes to robotically regurgitate the talking points given to him by the PR firm his parents hired, and he was taken at his word that he was just a nice kid and not the smug asshole we all saw with our lying eyes. The end of the segment showed a Native American person having a conversation with a man wearing a MAGA hat, expressing the hope that those conversations could keep happening.\n\nWhen Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes was interviewed on Nightline, he was given room to say that the Proud Boys were not racist or misogynist, to blame all of his bad PR on Vic Berger editing his work in order to make it appear offensive, and was taken at his word. When Patrick Casey of the white supremacist group Identity Evropa was interviewed on Today, NBC\u2019s Peter Alexander spent more time talking about the group\u2019s sartorial choices and their well-spokenness than pushing him on his actual beliefs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe intent with these interviews, often, has been to \u201cbridge the divide\u201d in America brought on Donald Trump, to give their subjects a fair and balanced hearing. They get to give the \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d version of their views, and are usually far less off-the-rails than they are on their own YouTube channels and podcasts. This is not disinfecting, it\u2019s frog-boiling.\n\nWhen creeps like this were interviewed on daytime talk shows, however, the intent was to warn people about them, to make them look like the fools they are, and to agitate them out of their talking points so they\u2019d show their true, repulsive selves. To get them to the point where they\u2019d throw a chair at Geraldo Rivera\u2019s face. To give them enough rope to hang themselves with, because that\u2019s where the \u201cdisinfecting\u201d happens.\n\nPhil Donahue was good at this. He\u2019d have some Holocaust deniers on his namesake show, he\u2019d let them go on and on, being very polite to them, asking them questions, and then he\u2019d bring out the experts to refute whatever they were saying. And then he\u2019d bring out the Holocaust survivors. And then someone in the audience would ask the Holocaust denier what the denier\u2019s qualifications were and, surprise, he had none. End product? Everyone gets to see just how ignorant they actually are. Bonus end product? David Cole\u2014the Holocaust denier featured on that program and many others back in the day\u2014was so despised by all of America that he ended up changing his identity.\n\nThis is what a lot of people think they are doing when they interview extremists. They think they are doing the Phil Donahue thing. They are not doing the Phil Donahue thing. Because they leave out the part where they give them enough rope. They leave out the part where the subject gets pushed just enough to show their ugly. These news program interviews, frankly, are just not long enough to get to that point.\n\nOf course, not all talk shows were quite as classy as Donahue, but that wasn\u2019t necessarily a drawback. In fact, there\u2019s something to be said for the fact that trashy, sideshow-esque shows are a far more appropriate venue for white supremacists than Nightline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the late talk-show host Morton Downey Jr. said, ever so frankly, in the documentary Talked To Death:\n\nWe are professionals. We are in this business to make money. To make money we have to get ratings. A lotta times, to get ratings, we have to make you look stupid, not ourselves. And we will always opt to make you look stupid. All right? So if you wanna be famous for being stupid, make sure you\u2019re a guest on a talk show.\n\nWith extremists placed in the same category as \u201cout-of-control teens,\u201d paternity testing, men cheating on their wives with their mothers-in-law, people who claimed to be satanic ritual abuse survivors, and other people who were there to be \u201cfamous for being stupid,\u201d viewers got the message, loud and clear: Ideas like \u201cwhite genocide\u201d or holocaust denial were things to be horrified by, rather than seriously considered as an alternate viewpoint. More than anyone else, bigots deserve to be famous for being stupid.\n\nIt was the informality of these shows that allowed for the host to actually get in the face of the Nazis or Ku Klux Klan members appearing on the program and directly confront them in a way that conventional journalism simply would not allow.\n\nAnd then there was the audience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s just something visceral about the ritual of booing at the bad guys, followed by an audience member getting up and telling them they are a horrible person and then being loudly cheered. If you\u2019re a teenager and you\u2019re watching this\u2014as many of us did after school\u2014it sets it up in your mind that you do not want to be the person being booed, you want to be the person being cheered for. It\u2019s simplistic, sure, but with something like this, simplistic is sometimes better.\n\n\n\nIn a 1993 episode of The Ricki Lake Show about the women of the KKK, the panel also included a black woman, whose son was murdered by a member of the Klan. So while Rachel Pendergraft\u2014now the spokeswoman for the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan Party\u2014was up there waxing on about how the hate group was a non-violent civil rights organization for white people who just want to enjoy being white people in peace, that woman\u2014identified onscreen by her first name, Loretta\u2014was also sitting there as living, breathing evidence that Pendergraft was full of shit.\n\nThat mattered. It also mattered that regular people, in regular clothes, in the studio audience, were getting up and saying \u201cI think this woman is full of shit,\u201d and being cheered for. That they were booing the women on the stage.\n\nOne of the ways segments like the Sandmann interview fail is by not putting their subjects into any context. Sure, maybe they\u2019re a tad hateful, but they\u2019re sitting there in an interview room, by themselves, and you don\u2019t see the people they actually hurt, and you don\u2019t see the people who can actually refute their talking points. These are one-on-one interviews, done in a vacuum, often by someone whose goal it is to say \u201cCome together, America, things aren\u2019t that bad!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 2001 episode of The Jenny Jones Show focused on a subject we\u2019re all too familiar with these days: internet hate sites. The guests included Matthew P. Hale (now in jail for trying to murder a judge), the white supremacist founder of the World Church Of The Creator, Stormfront founder Don Black and his young son Derek (who has since renounced white supremacy), and Shirley and Margie Phelps of the Westboro Baptist Church.\n\nJones probed them about children (children!) being able to see their websites. Graphics showed them engulfed in flames! Random people who had previously been audience members were brought up on stage to tell them they suck! And, as per usual, the ritualistic cheering of the good and booing of the bad.\n\nIt was clumsy, it was simplistic, and it also included a completely incongruous segment on a woman who ran a Marilyn Manson fan site. Still, it was better and more effective than whatever Today is trying to do.\n\nThese shows, once so ubiquitous, have largely gone out of fashion, replaced with classier programs like The View or friendlier fare like The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Maybe they faded from the zeitgeist because cable and streaming made it possible to watch whatever we want during the day, or because there\u2019s no shock value in people dressing like goths anymore, or because, in one extreme example, an episode of The Jenny Jones Show led to a murder. Maybe we just evolved out of yelling at overweight people for dressing \u201ctoo sexy for their size,\u201d which would certainly be a point in our favor.\n\nBut Donahue, Jones, and company did do some things right. And when they put the spotlight on bigots, the message was clear: Americans should not be united with people like that, but against them.\n\nIronically, one of the few things that ever did \u201cbring Americans together\u201d was being united in hating that talk-show staple, the Westboro Baptist Church. The Phelpses and their followers were covered extensively in the media, and yet you never saw too many people going \u201cStop! Don\u2019t give them a platform!\u201d Why? Because no one in their right mind would have taken that lesson from the way they were portrayed in the media. If anything, their sheer repulsiveness made hating gay people an extremely embarrassing stance to take. The more they opened their mouths, the less anyone wanted to join their club."
