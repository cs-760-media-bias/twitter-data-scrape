    "text": "In 1979, a small network with an unusual name rolled out a big idea: Let viewers make up their own minds. C-SPAN opened the doors to Washington policymaking, providing gavel-to-gavel coverage of the U.S. Congress without editing, commentary or analysis. A lot has changed in 40 years, but that original big idea is more relevant than ever. Underpinning this impartial, balanced coverage is the fact that no government or taxpayer dollars support C-SPAN, as we have always been funded as a public service by your cable or satellite provider. Thank you for being a part of this journey as we continue forward with our vision of being your unfiltered view of government. C-SPAN Milestones\n\nC-SPAN in 60 Seconds\n\nPress Center\n\nA Message From Our Founder\n\nC-SPAN is a public service.\n\nWe are a non-profit created in 1979 by a then-new industry called cable television, and today we remain true to our founding principles, providing gavel-to-gavel coverage of the workings of the U.S. Congress, both the House and Senate, all without editing, commentary or analysis.\n\nOver the years, we've grown to be so much more \u2013 on TV, online, on radio, through podcasts and on social platforms (YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram). We supplement live coverage of the Capitol with ideologically balanced programming concerning all manner of public policy and politics. In so doing, we promote open and transparent dialogue between the public and their elected and appointed officials \u2013 and those campaigning for office.\n\nUnderpinning this impartial, balanced coverage is the fact that no government or taxpayer dollars support C-SPAN, as we continue to be funded as a public service from your cable or satellite provider.\n\nC-SPAN began with only four employees: Brian Lamb, Jana Dabrowski Fay, Don Houle and Brian Lockman. Those four transmitted the first television feed from the U.S. House of Representatives to C-SPAN viewers on March 19, 1979, the first day the House allowed television coverage of its floor debates. That televised congressional session began with a one-minute speech by then-Congressman Al Gore and reached just 3 million American cable and satellite homes.\n\nFor C-SPAN founder Brian Lamb and the nascent network's cable system affiliates that provide its funding, the televised House feed was only the beginning. C-SPAN added what became its signature call-in programs the following year to provide a direct conduit between the American public and the nation's political leaders. That direct viewer-to-leader dialogue and discussion of current events continues each day on Washington Journal.\n\nIn 1982, the network expanded from eight to 16, and then 24 hours, enabling it to add a wider variety of public affairs programming to viewers while maintaining its commitment to carry the proceedings of the U.S. House, live and gavel-to-gavel.\n\nIn 1986, the U.S. Senate voted to televise its debates, and C-SPAN launched a second channel, C-SPAN2, to provide unfiltered, gavel-to-gavel access to that body.\n\nWhen the House and Senate are in session, C-SPAN commits to covering both bodies live and in their entirety. This is a voluntary commitment; there is no contract with Congress to carry its proceedings.\n\nIn 2001, C-SPAN3 was launched to provide access to additional public affairs events, particularly live coverage of key congressional hearings.\n\nOn weekends, ever since 1998, C-SPAN2 becomes Book TV, which covers non-fiction book and author events; and C-SPAN3 becomes American History TV, created in 2011, to offer historical lectures, oral histories and special history series.\n\nC-SPAN also extensively covers the president and the executive branch, including regular coverage of the daily White House and Department of State briefings. Coverage of the Supreme Court has been more challenging. Beginning in 1988, with a letter to then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist, C-SPAN has consistently called for the Supreme Court to allow cameras to cover its approximately 75 hours of annual oral arguments. To date, the court has refused this request. The network has televised more than 100 oral arguments before federal courts, which do allow cameras, as well as many state supreme courts.\n\nIn 1993, C-SPAN created the C-SPAN Bus, a 45-foot interactive learning center to travel across the nation visiting schools and community events in partnership with C-SPAN's cable providers. Bus visitors engage with C-SPAN representatives and interactive tools to learn about our unique public affairs programming and online resources. Most recently, we rolled out the C-SPAN \"Cities Tour,\" which explores the American story through weeklong visits to U.S. communities to record local history and authors.\n\nIn 1997, we added C-SPAN Radio, available in the Washington, D.C., area and via a mobile app.\n\nIn 2010, C-SPAN launched the Video Library. All C-SPAN content, since 1987, is archived on our website and is free for public use \u2013 now with nearly a quarter million hours of primary source video and growing every day.\n\nOur deep multi-platform presence \u2013 television, audio, social platforms and our website \u2013 makes C-SPAN the go-to resource for political journalists, Capitol Hill staff, members of Congress and the interested public. In the current media marketplace, there's no other place quite like C-SPAN, and perhaps none more trusted. C-SPAN\u2019s highly motivated viewers know they are getting a unique product, one with a special place in the news media.\n\nC-SPAN is the recipient of dozens of national awards and citations, including three George Foster Peabody Awards: one for institutional excellence in 1993, one in the historical documentary category for its 1999 American Presidents series, and one in 2011 for the C-SPAN online Video Library.\n\nForty years ago, C-SPAN first put the U.S. House of Representatives on television, opening a window for viewers to get an unfiltered view of government. While Washington may have changed, we haven't. Our unblinking eye on Congress and public debate continues. The window is still open, giving the world a front-row-seat to democracy \u2013 allowing you to make up your own mind."

    "text": "Columnist\n\nPrecisely at noon on March 19, 1979, six newly installed video cameras went live in the gallery of the House chamber for the first time. Washington was never the same.\n\nThat broadcast, about to mark its 40th anniversary, launched the Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network.\n\nC-SPAN is now such a ubiquitous presence in the capital that it is easy to forget how radical an idea it was. The network not only gave citizens thousands of miles away their first real-time, unfiltered look at how government works; it also upended the balance of power in the marble corridors of Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cOnce junior members can acquire notoriety, the ability of older members to coerce them goes down dramatically,\u201d says Newt Gingrich, who arrived in the House chamber as a freshman congressman only a couple of months before C-SPAN did.\n\nIn that sense, C-SPAN was a political ancestor of social media and the megaphone it has given to newcomers such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). No longer did lawmakers have to spend decades working their way up the ranks before they had any real voice or influence.\n\nGingrich was one of the earliest to discern the power and reach of the new channel. It helped launch him to the speaker\u2019s chair and Republicans into the majority for the first time in four decades.\n\nHe made himself the star of C-SPAN\u2019s late show, railing after the close of legislative business to a growing fan base of conservatives across the country. By 1984, Gingrich had become such an irritant to those in power that Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill furiously ordered the cameras to pan out and reveal that Gingrich and his backup band of backbenchers were speaking for hours on end to an empty chamber. They kept going anyway.\n\nNor was the flamethrower from Georgia alone in seeing the network\u2019s potential to put a political career on fast-forward. The very first House member to step into C-SPAN\u2019s unblinking gaze on its 1979 opening day was a 30-year-old Tennessee Democrat named Al Gore \u2014 who, as it happened, had written his senior thesis at Harvard on how TV transformed the presidency.\n\n\u201cTelevision will change this institution, Mr. Speaker, just as it has changed the executive branch,\u201d Gore said.\n\nThat was precisely what Sam Rayburn had feared, when the then-speaker banned the cameras back in the 1950s. Rayburn preferred to have as little contact as possible with journalists, and thought the best kind of House member was one who kept his mouth shut and bided his time in the seniority system.\n\nIt did not take long before O\u2019Neill was telling colleagues they had \u201cmade a terrible mistake.\u201d The May 1979 budget debate took twice as long as usual, he said, because House members were showboating for the cameras. \u201cSome members now rush back to their offices to see themselves on their new videotape machines,\u201d Newsweek reported.\n\nC-SPAN was the brainchild of Brian Lamb, then the Washington bureau chief of Cablevision magazine, who had been advocating for the burgeoning cable industry to offer more public affairs programming. When he discovered in 1977 that the House was seriously considering the idea of broadcasting its proceedings, Lamb talked the cable operators into setting aside a channel for them.\n\nIt took a couple of years to work out the arrangements. House leaders resisted Lamb\u2019s entreaties to install C-SPAN\u2019s own cameras in its sanctum; then, as now, the cameras in the chamber belong to and are controlled by Congress.\n\nAs it launched, there was plenty of resistance and skepticism. Older House members worried their constituents would see the unseemly arm-twisting that went on \u2014 and that some of them occasionally took naps in the chamber.\n\nOthers predicted C-SPAN would have no audience. \u201cHouse debates are usually so boring and confusing, it\u2019s going to take a very strange person to watch this stuff for any length of time,\u201d political scientist Norman Ornstein told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nIt turned out there were such people. In C-SPAN\u2019s early years, a group of Iowa women formed a club called \u201cWatchdogs of Congress,\u201d which met every day around a television. A viewer in Lubbock, Tex., was so addicted that when her cable system dropped C-SPAN, she bought a $2,000 earth-station antenna to get it; the Lubbock city council ordered its cable company to reinstate the channel.\n\nOne day in 1983, Lamb was hosting one of C-SPAN\u2019s call-in shows and got a frantic message from his producer to pick up the line on which a caller from Washington was holding. (Lamb usually gave priority to long-distance calls, because they cost money back then.)\n\nAfter a pause, a woman\u2019s voice came on the air. \u201cHello, is this Mr. Brian Lamb?\u201d she asked. \u201cWould you hold one moment, please, for the president?\u201d\n\nThe caller was indeed Ronald Reagan, who had been watching from his study in the White House, where C-SPAN played on Channel 10. And he had a few things he wanted to get off his chest.\n\nAfter the House started broadcasting, it would be another seven years before the stodgy Senate would allow cameras in. One of the last holdouts was Minority Leader Robert C. Byrd, who changed his mind after making a visit home to West Virginia and being mistaken for another politician with a shock of white hair. He realized O\u2019Neill had become far more famous than he, thanks in no small part to C-SPAN.\n\n\u201cThe Senate is fast becoming the invisible half of Congress,\u201d groused Byrd, who would later become a fixture on C-SPAN2, subjecting its viewers to 100 speeches on the history of the Senate.\n\nWhen C-SPAN began broadcasting the Senate on June 2, 1986, one of the first to take the floor was \u2014 yes, again \u2014 Al Gore. Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), the former astronaut, comically applied makeup to the top of his balding head, as he declared, \u201cPersonally, of course, I plan to do nothing different.\u201d Then he asked viewers in Ohio whether they liked him better in a red tie or a blue one.\n\nBut as the novelty wore off, it became more and more apparent what a treasure C-SPAN turned out to be.\n\nThe network, which can now be seen in more than 90 million households, still gives us daily proceedings from the House and Senate chambers. It also lets us hear important issues explored in committee rooms, helps us size up candidates on the campaign trail, engages us with book authors and saves a seat for us at think-tank roundtables. It challenges us to think for ourselves, without the clatter of punditry.\n\nSo happy birthday, C-SPAN. We need you more than ever."

    "text": "\n\nAir Force Secretary Heather Wilson speaks with airmen at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida on Oct. 14, 2018. (Senior Airman Joseph Pick/U.S. Air Force)\n\nLong before President Trump introduced his Space Force vision as an applause line at political rallies, the top administration official who would be selected to oversee its creation came out decisively against a similar plan.\n\nAir Force Secretary Heather Wilson said in a visit to Capitol Hill in June 2017 she opposed the creation of a \u201cSpace Corps,\u201d a service some lawmakers had proposed to oversee military operations in space.\n\n\u201cThe Pentagon is complicated enough. We\u2019re trying to simplify. This will make it more complex, add more boxes to the organization chart and cost more money,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I had more money, I would put it into lethality, not bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nLess than two years later, Wilson finds herself leading a similar effort directed this week by the president.\n\nAs Air Force secretary, Wilson has for the past two years led a department that includes about 321,000 active-duty airmen and has a budget of more than $156 billion. Initially recruited by former Pentagon chief Jim Mattis, she has focused on building up the readiness of Air Force squadrons to deploy after years of congressionally mandated budget cuts. But her role is likely to become even more prominent in coming months, following the Trump administration\u2019s decision to put her in charge of the Space Force.\n\nWilson\u2019s name also has been floated by some lawmakers as a contender to become the next Pentagon chief, two months after Mattis resigned in protest of Trump\u2019s policies and the president replaced him on an acting basis with Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan.\n\nLike the Space Corps idea that Wilson, Mattis and other Pentagon officials fended off in 2017, the new Space Force proposal calls for the creation of a new branch of service within the Air Force Department, complete with a four-star general joining the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But it is smaller than the Space Force plan Trump originally conceived, which also called for a separate Department of the Space that would have been led by an appointed service secretary, rather than falling under Wilson\u2019s purview.\n\nThe political realities for the Pentagon changed after Trump announced at a National Space Council meeting in June 2018 he wanted a Space Force, a \u201cseparate but equal\u201d branch of the armed forces. The plan now needs approval by Congress.\n\nWilson said Thursday that when the president sends his 2020 budget proposal to Congress in coming days, it will include draft legislation for the Space Force. She defended the idea, saying Trump had prioritized its development at a time when adversaries seek to deny the United States the use of space in times of crisis or war.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the secretary of the Air Force. I don\u2019t have the same kind of power of the presidency that the White House has,\u201d she said, answering a question from The Washington Post on C-SPAN\u2019s \u201cNewsmakers\u201d program.\n\n\u201cBy bringing this forward and saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to do something different. We\u2019re going to create a new force. We\u2019re going to do it in a cost-effective way,' the president has made this kitchen-table conversation, and he has made it a central element of what he wants to do as president of the United States,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, kudos to him for bringing this to the fore in a way that it really wasn\u2019t before.\"\n\nWilson\u2019s favoring U.S. military investment in space isn\u2019t a surprise. The service has warned about national security issues there for years and released a report recently that laid out a scenario in which anti-satellite weapons increasingly are becoming a threat to national security.\n\nHow the administration goes about focusing on space has been more of a friction point.\n\nLast fall, Wilson signed a memo that stated the cost of starting a Space Force Department and U.S. Space Command would be about $13 billion over five years. Some Space Force proponents and budget analysts questioned whether the number was inflated.\n\nWilson said Thursday that the internal Air Force plan included a full Space Force Department, rather than a Space Force service, a distinction that will make the new service leaner and place it on even footing with the Marine Corps, which is part of the Navy Department.\n\nBy creating a service along those lines, the money needed to start a Space Force will be \u201csubstantially less\u201d than the Air Force plan last fall, she said, without providing a new figure.\n\nIn an internal \u201cpre-decisional\u201d memo obtained by The Washington Post, the new Space Force estimates are dramatically different: between $72 million and $73 million per year, with other costs remaining in the broader budget for the Air Force and Pentagon.\n\nBut a defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the discussions, said the figure was \u201cartificially straight-lined\u201d in budget documents, and the Defense Department plans to explain to Congress that the overall cost of a fully operational capable Space Force will be \u201csomewhat north\u201d of $500 million per year. Those figures are roughly in line with estimates by Todd Harrison, a budget analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies who predicted the new costs would be between $300 million and $550 million per year.\n\nWilson said she expects there will be discussions for months about the new Space Force proposal and possibly congressional hearings. It would be \u201cunwise\u201d at this point to speculate whether Congress will be receptive to the new plan, she said.\n\nWilson, a former New Mexico congresswoman, Air Force officer and university president, already has coped with rumors reported by Foreign Policy magazine that the president was angrily considering replacing her because of how she had handled the issue.\n\nRep. Mike D. Rogers (R-Ala.), who along with Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) proposed the Space Corps in 2017, said in an interview with the Opelika-Auburn News that the rumors were \u201ca shot across the bow\u201d after \u201cthe White House found out she was working against it.\u201d Rogers said he thought she had become more supportive.\n\nWilson declined to say whether she was committed to serving in her current job and would not say on C-SPAN whether she would accept an offer to become defense secretary. Her focus, she said, is taking care of the Air Force.\n\nWilson, in an interview with The Post, cited \u201cDead Poets Society\u201d when asked about her future. In the film, an English teacher played by Robin Williams urges students to seize the day.\n\n\u201cTomorrow is really uncertain,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean that in a professional way, I just mean that you never know. All you have is today. What are you going to do today? And that\u2019s all any of us have. I try to guide the Air Force to the future, but I think any of us that [say they] know what will happen tomorrow or next week are kidding ourselves about what it means to be human. We don\u2019t have any certainty in life, and I always live my life that way.\u201d\n\nWilson and Gen. David L. Goldfein, the Air Force\u2019s chief of staff, also say the service needs to grow to match a national defense strategy Mattis released last year focusing more heavily on preparing for adversaries like Russia and China and less on counterterrorism operations.\n\n\u201cThe operational squadron is really the fist of the United States Air Force,\u201d she said. \"Our analysis says to execute the National Defense Strategy, we need 386. We can quibble about whether it\u2019s 386 or 390 or 375, but the Air Force is too small for what the nation is asking it to do.\u201d\n\nOne issue decided recently: The Air Force will buy new F-15 CX aircraft, Wilson said. The decision, first reported by Bloomberg in December, will provide the Air Force with new \u201cfourth-generation\u201d fighters even as it prioritizes the stealthy \u201cfifth-generation\u201d F-35, a more advanced aircraft.\n\nWilson said in an interview with Defense News in September that she thought the Air Force should focus on spending its money on F-35s. Other senior leaders at the Pentagon, including Shanahan, pressed to buy both.\n\nWilson told The Post that the service needs to grow from about 55 fighter squadrons now to 62 by 2030. The question is how to get there.\n\n\u201cNow, you can argue and say, \u2018Why don\u2019t you just buy more F-35s?\u2019 \u201d Wilson said. \u201cYou get fewer of them, and they do cost more to maintain, and Lockheed Martin hasn\u2019t driven down the sustainment costs as fast as we wanted. So it\u2019s, okay, what\u2019s the best use of the money if you are adding money for tactical air, and how do we modernize this fleet?\u201d"

The crucible of the presidency has forged some of the very best and very worst leaders in our national history, along with much in between.\n\nBased on interviews conducted over the years with a variety of presidential biographers, this book provides not just a complete ranking of our presidents, but stories and analyses that capture the character of the men who held the office. From Abraham Lincoln\u2019s political savvy and rhetorical gifts to James Buchanan\u2019s indecisiveness, this book teaches much about what makes a great leader\u2013and what does not.\n\nAs America looks ahead to our next election, this book offers perspective and criteria that may help us choose our next leader wisely."

The crucible of the presidency has forged some of the very best and very worst leaders in our national history, along with much in between.\n\nBased on interviews conducted over the years with a variety of presidential biographers, this book provides not just a complete ranking of our presidents, but stories and analyses that capture the character of the men who held the office. From Abraham Lincoln\u2019s political savvy and rhetorical gifts to James Buchanan\u2019s indecisiveness, this book teaches much about what makes a great leader\u2013and what does not.\n\nAs America looks ahead to our next election, this book offers perspective and criteria that may help us choose our next leader wisely."

The Selective Service, an independent government agency, maintains information on those eligible to serve in the military, as well as barriers to national and public service. The chair and vice chairs of the commission held a news conference on their initial findings. Vice Chair Debra Wada said that 70 percent of Americans had never considered military service and that 70 percent of recruits come from southern and western states, in comparison to around 40 percent 40-45 years ago.\n\n\n\nIn 2017, Congress created NCMNPS to review the selective service system and whether women should be required to register as all 18-25 year old males are required to do so. They also are charged with suggesting ways to create a universal expectation of national military, national or public service.

    "text": "An entrepreneur, environmentalist, philanthropist and legendary broadcasting industry executive has died.\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve Dodge passed away Wednesday evening as a result of a bicycle accident police believe he caused.\n\nDodge founded American Radio Systems after entering the radio business some 30 years ago with the 1988 purchase of eight radio stations with Atlantic Ventures\u2019 Eric Schultz. Before that, he carved his teeth in cable TV. In 1995, he sprouted American Tower Corporation.\n\nRBR+TVBR looks back at the achievements of Steve Dodge in this exclusive retrospective.\n\nOn Bonita Beach Road in Bonita Springs, Fla., a city between Fort Myers and Naples, 73-year-old Dodge was traveling on his bicycle westbound, using a sidewalk.\n\nThis time of year, the thoroughfare is busy, thanks to snowbirds from the Midwest and Northeast who have second homes in Lee County. Businesses line the street, which connects Barefoot Beach to the Bonita National Golf and Country Club east of I-75, touching the Everglades.\n\nWitnesses told the Lee County Sheriff\u2019s Office that Dodge attempted to cross the road illegally, at an angle in front of traffic. A vehicle also traveling westbound hit Dodge from the rear, sending him and his bike into the windshield of the car before sending them flying off the vehicle.\n\nAccording to WINK-11, which first reported the story, Dodge was taken to Lee County Memorial Hospital, where he later passed away from his injuries.\n\nFROM CABLE TO COMMERCIAL RADIO\n\nOn October 15, 1987, Dodge made a decision that would reshape his career.\n\nNine years after its formation, and just 17 months after an IPO at $14.50 per share, Dodge\u2019s Beverly, Mass.-based American Cablesystems Corp. was sold to Continental Cablevision for roughly $482 million in cash and the assumption of more than $250 million in debt.\n\nAt the time, Continental was the No. 3 cable TV operator in the nation.\n\nWhat did Dodge do? From the proceeds of the cable company\u2019s sale, he teamed up with Eric Schultz of Atlantic Ventures to form a radio company by acquiring WEZO-AM (today WDCX-AM) and WEZO-FM (now WRMM) in Rochester, N.Y., from Malrite Communications.\n\nIn June 1988, Dodge gained the industry\u2019s attention in a big way. For the exact price of $28,323,750, Atlantic Ventures captured WRKO-AM & WROR-FM in Boston as part of an FCC settlement agreement with former radio giant RKO.\n\nFour other stations were snapped up by Atlantic by the end of the year. This led Dodge to receive the Most Successful Entrant Award at Americom\u2019s 1989 Dealmakers Ball at the Virgin Grand Hotel on St. John, USVI \u2014 today at Westin property recovered from Hurricane Maria.\n\nDodge must have had the Five-Year Itch. Come June 1993, in an environment where the radio and recording industry were struggling, Atlantic entered into an estimated $115 million merger with Tom Stoner\u2019s Stoner Broadcasting Systems and David Pearlman\u2019s Multi Market Communications.\n\nKeeping its headquarters in Boston, this merger saw the creation of American Radio Systems (ARS), creating an entity with duopolies in four of its eight markets and ranking\n\nabout 15th in the nation for total revenue. Pearlman was COO; Joe Winn was CFO.\n\nServing as CEO was Dodge, who now had properties including WONE-AM, WTUE-FM & WMMX-FM in Dayton. The latter station in 1991 evolved to WMMX from WWSN under VP/GM Deborah Parenti, who Stoner appointed in December 1990 following a two-year run at WDJX/Louisville. Parenti today is Publisher of the Radio + Television Business Report.\n\nTaking to Facebook, Parenti was \u201cstunned and saddened\u201d to hear of the loss of Dodge.\n\n\u201cDodge, who was CEO of American Radio Systems, one of [the best] \u2014 if not the best \u2014radio companies ever, was an astute, brilliant business person and a magnificent human being,\u201d Parenti wrote. \u201cHe assembled a team and instilled a spirit that made all of us a little prouder and radio a lot better.\u201d\n\nBy the mid-1990s, Dodge was a radio industry force. In an August 1995 cover story in Radio & Records, Dodge engaged in a \u201cTen Questions\u201d session with the former industry trade publication, admitting, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make sure we don\u2019t outgrow the capabilities of our management. I think some radio companies \u2026 are running the risk of becoming overextended \u2014 financially or managerially or both.\u201d\n\nDodge ranked No. 7 on Radio Ink\u2018s 40 Most Powerful People in Radio list in 1996 and No. 6 in 1997, a year that saw a $120 million swap with EXCL Communications that handed ARS the assets of KBAY-FM/San Jose and a Portland, Ore., 100kw Adult Alternative \u2014 KINK-FM. EXCL received a 100kw FM in Sacramento that is today Entravision\u2019s Country KNTY-FM.\n\nThere would be no ranking in 1998. That\u2019s because there\u2019d be no more ARS.\n\nA TRANSITION TO TOWER OPERATIONS\n\nAt the fall NAB Convention of 1997, the radio industry received a \u201cshocking\u201d announcement. Dodge\u2019s ARS was to be acquired in a mammoth merger with CBS Corporation, creating CBS Radio \u2014 the entity now owned by Entercom.\n\nThe deal was valued at a whopping $2.6 billion and eventually approved on May 27, 1998. Closing came in early June 1998.\n\nTop ARS executives Don Bouloukos, John Gehron, and Pearlman joined CBS as co-COOs.\n\nDodge departed the radio business with a pivot that created an entity far bigger and perhaps more valued than ARS. In 1995, American Tower Corp. began life as a subsidiary of ARS. With ARS\u2019s 1998 sale to CBS, American Tower was spun off into a separate company. An Initial Public Offering of stock transpired, with the company trading as \u201cAMT\u201d on the NYSE.\n\nAmerican Tower then looked south, to Mexico. In 1999, it launched operations south of the border, and thrived. Today, it is the nation\u2019s No. 1 independent tower operator, with more than 3,000 sites. Its Polanco offices, in Mexico City, are easily visible from a main perif\u00e9rico \u2014 the traffic-clogged beltway traversing through this mega-metropolis. In 2000, American Tower expanded to Brazil.\n\nWith business sputtering, American Tower in 2002 shifted its operational focus from acquiring and developing towers to improving operations. It proved to be a smart move.\n\nAfter dipping to $1.41 in October 2002, American Tower went on an impressive growth spurt that continues today. As of 1:05pm Eastern on Jan. 18, AMT was trading at $164.56.\n\nDodge, however, opted for \u201cretirement\u201d well before American Tower stock motored upward.\n\nIn January 2004, Dodge \u2014 at this point Chairman of the Board of Directors \u2014 told them that he intended to retire prior to the company\u2019s annual shareholders meeting held during the second quarter of that year.\n\nDodge wouldn\u2019t necessarily disappear: he continued to have a part-time role, as an employee. He said at the time, \u201cIt\u2019s been both satisfying and fun to watch \u2026 the management team grab hold of the company and really run with it. The results under their leadership have been rock solid, and I anticipate more of the same in the future. I also believe that at this stage the shadow of a founding chairman serves no productive purpose, and that in fact this very talented group will find it energizing to have its own space, with complete accountability for its own results. Surely, they have earned that opportunity, and as a large stakeholder in the company\u2014both now and going forward\u2014I look forward to benefiting from their ongoing efforts.\u201d\n\nCommenting on Dodge\u2019s death, American Tower President/CEO Jim Taiclet told RBR+TVBR, \u201cOur company\u2019s founder was a true pioneer in three industries; cable, radio, and mobile and broadcast infrastructure. Even more so, he was a tremendous family man, mentor and friend. He blended incredible business acumen with a wonderful sense of humor and care for people. He will be sorely missed by each of us whose lives he touched.\u201d\n\nA DEVELOPMENTAL DECISION\n\nWhile Dodge was \u201cretired\u201d from American Tower, he was far from packing his bags and moving from Boston to Florida. He formed a real estate development company in 2003 in the North Shore area of the Boston metropolitan area, forming Windover Development LLC.\n\nWindover is responsible for residential and commercial developments including university dormitories and the Beauport Hotel in Gloucester, Mass., described as \u201ca quintessential New England seaside getaway.\u201d\n\nHe then established Windover Development of Florida, which brought him to Bonita Springs.\n\nIn an April 2018 alumni profile in The Hotchkiss School\u2019s online newsletter, Dodge \u2014 a member of the Class of 1963 \u2014 shared some of his family history.\n\n\u201cI grew up in the New Haven/Hamden area,\u201d he said. \u201cMy father died when I was eight or nine, and my mother then married Donald Bradley, Class of 1925, who subsequently sent three of his sons to Hotchkiss. My oldest brother, Lowell Dodge \u201958, was the next to go, and I was last up.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember being asked if I wanted to go to Hotchkiss, and I felt like I was sent there, more or less. Lowell was a hardworking student, had big grades, and won the Teagle Prize. His was a hard act to follow. I was less inclined than Lowell to work hard, at least then; I still thought I might redeem my standing with my worried mother if I won the Teagle, too. So, I went for it, but came in second. I can\u2019t remember which classmate edged me out by a point!\u201d\n\nDodge would go on to Yale University, where he received a B.A. in English before serving in the Navy, where he achieved the rank of Lieutenant.\n\n\u201cI did more real learning and growing up in the Navy than anywhere else \u2013 before or since,\u201d Dodge said. \u201cActions produced tangible outcomes that mattered, and working hard became a habit. Still, my personal development really started at Hotchkiss, and continued at Yale, where a key part of my education was learning from what I didn\u2019t do well.\u201d\n\nIn 1978, Dodge landed his first conventional job at Bank Boston, where he was pulled out of the training program to evaluate a new industry \u2014 cable television. \u201cI fell in love with it,\u201d Dodge said.\n\nAs he looked back on his decision to leave Bank Boston to start American Cablesystems, Dodge said, \u201cIt\u2019s clear I caught an early break by getting exposure to a young and promising industry. I\u2019m damn grateful to my first boss for picking me out of a pile of trainees, which included MBAs from places like Harvard and Stanford, to lead the bank\u2019s cable initiative. I loved competing with the business school guys, was told they were the best of the best, but I didn\u2019t necessarily see it.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of his experience with ARS, Dodge commented, \u201cI was drawn to radio because to win in that industry you have to do a lot of things well. From my perspective at the time, radio was much more management-intensive than cable, where we were basically distributers of video product created by others. In radio, we did our own research, found and hired the talent, created our own product, and had to figure out how to effectively market it \u2013 a whole different ballgame. And for the first several years we got our butts kicked. The radio business has never been kind to rookies, and it\u2019s hard for me to recount all the mistakes we made in the beginning. But we dug in, found and attracted the right talent, and in time we got it all going on.\u201d\n\nRBR+TVBR"

A Biden nomination by the Democrats could complicate the GOP's ability to recreate the Trump electoral coalition, Chapman said.\n\n\"A Biden [type] keeps me up at night, and the reason is because he's perceived as more moderate,\" Chapman said. \"He has credibility with working-class voters.\"\n\n[Read: 45 Democrats jostling to challenge Trump in 2020]\n\nAt stake are large chunks of voters in swing states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, which proved decisive for Trump in 2016.\n\n\"[I] think the entire game in 2020 is whether Republicans can recreate that coalition of 2016 or not, and losing the working-class voters in a 2020 election would make it very hard for Republicans to win,\" Chapman said.\n\nWhile several prominent Democrats are already in the 2020 race, Biden has yet to jump in.\n\nChapman said there's no reason to think Trump won't run again in 2020. Any potential Republican challenges for the nomination would likely prove \"pretty unsuccessful.\""

They do a job, but just like any operation, we can review what they do and if we need to tweak it I\u2019m committed to doing that. There\u2019s been some question about ICE\u2019s interior enforcement \u2014 we need to look at that,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.\n\nAsked if he would allow a bill to abolish ICE to come through his committee, he flatly rejected the idea: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nOn the border wall and shutdown fight, Mr. Thompson said he\u2019s not opposed to spending money on border barriers, and acknowledged voting for such money in the past.\n\nHe said the trouble with President Trump\u2019s current demand is that there\u2019s not enough detail on how the $5.7 billion request would be spent.\n\n\u201cIn the past, projects that I have supported, I\u2019ll support again, if the plans are there. But we don\u2019t have the plans,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the absence of a plan, I\u2019ll join my Democratic colleagues and oppose a so-called wall.\u201d\n\nMr. Thompson is returning to the chairman\u2019s post, which he also held the last time Democrats were in power, with an expansive agenda.\n\nHis most immediate committee priority is demanding an appearance by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who he said only testified once to the panel last year.\n\nHe said he had questions about her competence.\n\n\u201cSome of us have some concerns about whether or not she\u2019s been up to the task, but we\u2019ll give her a chance to defend her position,\u201d the congressman said.\n\nAlso in the plans are hearings with the chiefs of Customs and Border Protection and the Transportation Security Administration.\n\nMr. Thompson seemed to be bracing for battles with the Trump administration over information and access, saying he expects things to improve compared to the last two years when information was often late or over-redacted.\n\nIn other business, he said his committee is working on pipeline and port security and will work with other panels who share jurisdiction on election security to craft more help for states dealing with potential breaches and foreign meddling.\n\nHe said the move back toward a paper trail for votes has been surprising.\n\nHe said the 2018 election went smoother than some had feared because states were on the lookout and bad actors were aware the U.S. was alert.\n\n\u201cI think because people knew we were watching that many of those things did not occur,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did not have as much mischief in 2018 as we did in 2016, and some of it was probably associated with the training of officials was better.\u201d\n\nMr. Thompson said his committee has had a tradition of working in a bipartisan fashion, and he hoped to continue that and extend it to working with the administration.\n\nBut the politics of immigration could sour those hopes, with Mr. Trump demanding a crackdown on what he sees as a security emergency, while Democrats dismiss that as hyperbole.\n\nDuring the campaign some Democrats even announced their support for eliminating ICE, the agency that detains and deports illegal immigrants. Some liberal Democrats announced legislation to create a commission to abolish the agency and shift its duties elsewhere.\n\nThe frenzy peaked in the summer, as the president was backing away from his controversial zero tolerance border policy and the family separations that resulted.\n\nMr. Thompson\u2019s stance derails plans to eliminate the agency \u2014 though he said Congress will examine detention policies under the Trump administration.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

The crucible of the presidency has forged some of the very best and very worst leaders in our national history, along with much in between.\n\nBased on interviews conducted over the years with a variety of presidential biographers, this book provides not just a complete ranking of our presidents, but stories and analyses that capture the character of the men who held the office. From Abraham Lincoln\u2019s political savvy and rhetorical gifts to James Buchanan\u2019s indecisiveness, this book teaches much about what makes a great leader\u2013and what does not.\n\nAs America looks ahead to our next election, this book offers perspective and criteria that may help us choose our next leader wisely."
