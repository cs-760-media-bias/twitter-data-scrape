    "text": "Yayoi Kusama is the biggest-selling female artist in the world. And in her bright-red wig and quirky polka-dot ensembles, she is also one of the most instantly recognisable. At almost 90 years old she is still astonishingly prolific. Her upcoming show at the Victoria Miro gallery in London is bound to draw crowds around the block, desperate to be photographed inside her new, fabulously Instagrammable Infinity Room.\n\nBut before reaching this exalted position Kusama had to endure childhood trauma, and watch as her ideas were brazenly stolen by her male peers, events which led to mental illness and suicide attempts. Her extraordinary story of survival is told in a fascinating new documentary, Kusama: Infinity.\n\n- Eerie, hyper-real human sculptures\n\n- The artist who triumphed over her rape\n\n- The forgotten women of Impressionism\n\nKusama was born in 1929 in the rural provincial town of Matsumoto, Japan and from a young age was determined to be a painter. Her early works reveal what was to become an enduring fascination with both natural forms and polka dots, the latter allegedly appearing to her in a vision. However, her family were far from supportive. As Heather Lenz, the producer and director of Kusama: Infinity explains, it was simply not the thing for a woman at that time to have career ambitions. \u201cThe expectation was that she would get married and have kids \u2013 and not just get married but have an arranged marriage,\u201d she tells BBC Culture.\n\nShe sewed dollar bills into her kimono and set off across the Pacific determined to conquer New York\n\nHer mother snatched drawings from her before she was able to finish them, which may explain her obsessive creative drive as she rushes to finish a work before it can be taken from her. Frustrated at her husband\u2019s infidelity Kusama\u2019s mother would force her daughter to spy on him with his lovers. She found the experience so traumatic that she developed a lifelong aversion to sex.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Kusama began to think of a means of escaping her stifling home environment. A great admirer of Georgia O\u2019Keefe, in whose fantastical, dreamlike depictions of nature she saw a kindred spirit, she took the extraordinarily bold step of writing to her for advice. \u201cI\u2019m only on the first step of the long difficult life of being a painter. Will you kindly show me the way?\u201d she asked.\n\nShe must have been ecstatic when O\u2019Keefe wrote back, even if it was to warn her that \u201cIn this country an artist has a hard time making a living.\u201d All the same, she advised Kusama to come to the US and show her work to anyone who might be interested.\n\nAt the time Kusama spoke very little English, and it was prohibited to send money from Japan to the US. Undaunted, she sewed dollar bills into her kimono and set off across the Pacific determined to conquer New York and make her name in the world.\n\nInfinity and beyond\n\nIt was not to be that easy. The New York art world was male dominated to the extent that even many of the female dealers didn\u2019t want to exhibit women.\n\nAlthough Kusama won the praise of Donald Judd, a notable artist and critic, in an early review of her work, and even though the painter Frank Stella was an admirer, real success eluded her. A fact made all the more agonising as she was forced to watch her male peers gain recognition for her ideas.\n\nClaes Oldenburg was \u2018inspired\u2019 by her fabric phallic couch to start creating the soft sculpture for which he would become world famous, while Andy Warhol would copy her innovative idea of creating repeated images of the sole exhibit in her One Thousand Boats installation for his Cow Wallpaper.\n\nBut worse was to come. In 1965 Kusama created the world\u2019s first mirrored-room environment, a precursor to her Infinity Mirror Rooms, at the Castellane Gallery in New York. As man prepared to head for the moon, Kusama had uniquely grasped the public\u2019s growing awareness of infinity. She confronted them with this unnerving concept through a seemingly endless environment.\n\nOnly a few months later, in a complete change of artistic direction, avant-garde artist Lucas Samaras exhibited his own mirrored installation at the far more prestigious Pace Gallery.\n\nDistraught and dejected, Kusama threw herself from the window of her apartment.\n\nKusama\u2019s desire to create was always greater than her desire to die\n\nWith the support of friends such as gallery owner Beatrice Webb, she somehow managed to pull herself together and in a remarkable show of determination took herself to the 1966 Venice Biennale, without invitation, to show her Narcissus Garden. A witty take on the commercialisation of the art world, it comprised 1500 mirrored balls that she sold off at a few dollars a time \u2013 until officials put a stop to it.\n\n\u201cAt this point she\u2019s no longer going to be a slave to the gallery system and have someone decide when and where she\u2019ll show her art,\u201d says Lenz.\n\nConfronting her demons\n\nBack in the US, Kusama began staging happenings in newsworthy locations such as Central Park and the grounds of MoMa, often with the intention of promoting peace or criticising the art establishment. But the fact that many of these events involved nudity caused scandal back home in Japan and great shame to her conservative family. Even some elements of the US press criticised what they saw as her endless desire for publicity.\n\nIncreasingly disillusioned and depressed she returned home to Japan where, without the support of family or friends and finding herself unable to paint, she once again attempted suicide.\n\nBut it seems that Kusama\u2019s desire to create was always greater than her desire to die. Miraculously, she managed to find a hospital where the doctors were interested in art therapy and checked herself in.\n\nIn this secure environment she found herself able to make art again. Her first works were an uncharacteristically dark series of collages in which she embraced the imagery of natural life cycles, almost as if she was challenging herself to confront her demons.\n\nBy this point Kusama had been virtually forgotten both at home and abroad but showing her enduring creative drive and determination she began to re-establish herself from scratch, and gradually her work began to be re-evaluated. A retrospective of her work was held at the Center for International Contemporary Arts in New York in 1989, and four years later, the Japanese art historian, Akira Tatehata, managed to persuade the government that she should be the first solo artist to represent Japan at the 1993 Venice Biennale.\n\nAlthough a delicate Kusuma had to be accompanied by a psychotherapist, fearful of a nervous breakdown, the exhibition was a phenomenal success and led to a huge transformation in how she was received and recognised in Japan.\n\nFurther retrospectives followed while increasing recognition and her supportive environment allowed Kusama to continue to transform her trauma into art. However, when Lenz began work on her documentary in 2001 Kusama\u2019s global reputation was still in its infancy. \u201cIronically I thought the film was going to bring her greater success,\u201d she laughs.\n\nKusama\u2019s astonishing rise in the intervening years owes much to social media but one hopes that the documentary will encourage people to put down their phones and take time to properly reflect on her work next time they go to see it. Whether viewing pumpkins, polka dots or immersed in one of her awe-inspiring Infinity Rooms, what visitors are looking at is nothing less than the redemptive power of art.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Pollution threatens future of killer whales\n\nKiller whales are in deep trouble because of persistent chemical pollution in the environment, researchers say.\n\nA new study suggests the long-term viability of more than half of the different orca groups around the globe is now in question.\n\nSome populations, such as those around the UK, the Strait of Gibraltar, off Brazil, Japan and California, are almost certainly doomed.\n\nThe assessment is in Science magazine.\n\nThe issue is polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs.\n\nThese chemical compounds were once manufactured in vast quantities, and used in everything from plastics and paints to electrical equipment and sealants. But they are highly toxic and although banned decades ago have amassed in the environment, leaching into the ocean.\n\nKiller whales, or orcas, are top predators so they absorb all the PCB pollution taken in by the different prey in their food chain - from fish, right up to seals and sharks.\n\nThe PCBs stunt the ovaries of female orcas, limiting their ability to produce calves. The chemicals also suppress the immune system.\n\nWhat is the outlook for orcas?\n\nThe new study models the future of the killer whales' reproductive success and survivability against the chemical challenge.\n\nFor those populations living in clean waters, it is positive. Orcas in places like the Antarctic and the Arctic should increase their numbers.\n\nBut for those living in the most polluted seas, the next 30-50 years will be grim.\n\nThe killer whales that live on the west coast of Scotland, for example, are now down to just eight individuals and they have not produced a calf in more than 20 years.\n\nPaul Jepson, from the Zoological Society of London, says this group will \"disappear in my lifetime\".\n\n\"Over 50% of the populations that we've got data for will actually collapse in our model,\" he told the BBC's Science In Action programme.\n\n\"PCBs are such highly toxic chemicals, and they persist in the environment. And it's the killer whales that have by a long way the highest exposures now of any species on Earth; certainly any mammalian species.\"\n\nImage copyright John Bowler/RSPB Scotland Image caption The Scottish orcas have been found to be heavily contaminated\n\nThe curse of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nPolychlorinated biphenyls were manufactured from the 1920s\n\nBanned in the US in 1979, the UK in 1981 and the rest of the EU\n\nEurope produced some 300,000 tonnes from 1954 to 1984\n\nThe majority has yet to be destroyed or safely stored away\n\nPCBs were popular in coolant fluids in electrical apparatus\n\nThey were used in building construction, especially in sealants\n\nAlso in cutting fluids for machining, and carbonless copy paper\n\nToday, only North Korea still manufactures polychlorinated biphenyls\n\nWhy are the animals so exposed?\n\nEverything in this story works against the killer whales.\n\nNot only do they accumulate contaminants because of their position as top predators, but the toxic effects hit them where they are particularly vulnerable - in their ability to reproduce.\n\nThese are animals that take a long time to reach sexual maturity and even then have perhaps one calf every few years. This puts very precise pressure on a population.\n\nIn addition, PCBs are soluble in fat - and killer whales are extremely fat-rich animals. A mother's milk will be loaded with PCBs which she will pass on to her offspring during lactation.\n\nImage copyright Audun Rikardsen\n\nHow do we tackle the PCB legacy?\n\nMost PCBs have yet to be destroyed or safely stored away.\n\nSome countries have done better than others. In the US, where federal \"superfunds\" have been used to clean up the most heavily contaminated sites, PCB levels entering the ocean have come down.\n\nBut there needs to be much more urgency in places such as Europe.\n\n\"Improper disposal of PCB-containing equipment in landfills may lead to leakage and leaching of PCBs into nearby streams, river, estuaries, and ocean,\" said lead author on the new report, Jean-Pierre Desforges from Aarhus University, Denmark.\n\n\"We know that PCBs were used in paints and sealants in old buildings and for outer coating on ships, so if contaminated building materials are improperly disposed of they could also reach the environment, and demolition of buildings may cause PCBs to enter the air.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Paul Jepson: \"The killer whale is the most PCB-contaminated species on Earth\"\n\nCan we help the orcas themselves?\n\nThere is very little that can be done to recover the PCBs once they have reached the ocean. And the robustness of the chemicals means they will hang around in the environment for a very long time.\n\nBut there are parallel problems we could conceivably fix, said co-author Ailsa Hall from the Sea Mammal Research Unit at St Andrews University, UK.\n\n\"We should recognise that this is just one of many stresses on the animals,\" she told BBC News.\n\n\"There are things such as noise, changes in habitat, changes in the availability of prey - that we do have influence over. And if we do something about these factors, maybe we can reduce the overall burden of stress, and perhaps then our predictions won't be so dire.\"\n\nPaul Jepson added: \"I don't think there'll ever be another PCB story.\n\n\"I think the chemical industries have learnt the lesson - we know that being fat-soluble is a big risk factor, because that allows things to bioaccumulate.\n\n\"So, nowadays, no chemical with those properties would be allowed. But PCBs are so difficult to get rid of that we'll be dealing with the legacy for a long time.\"\n\nFollow on Twitter: @BBCAmos and @Vic_Gill"

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Spiny dogfish shark landed in Indonesia\n\nMeat from endangered sharks is finding its way on to the British menu, according to a study.\n\nDNA tests show that shark products destined for restaurants include two species vulnerable to extinction.\n\nConsumers may be unaware what shark they are eating - and whether it is from a sustainable population, British scientists say.\n\nThe UK is playing a continuing role in the \"damaging trade in endangered shark species\", they say.\n\nOne of the two threatened sharks identified - the scalloped hammerhead - is subject to international restrictions.\n\nUniversity of Exeter researchers say, despite the small number of samples studied, they have demonstrated the sale of threatened sharks, highlighting the global nature of the damaging trade in endangered species.\n\n\"The discovery of scalloped hammerheads in shark fins that were destined to be sold in the UK highlights how widespread the sale of these endangered species really is,\" Dr Andrew Griffiths told BBC News.\n\nImage copyright University of Exeter Image caption Shark fins: The species is indistinguishable\n\nThe research, reported in the journal Scientific Reports, examined both shark fins destined for restaurants and shark steaks sold in fishmongers and chip shops.\n\nIt found that Squalus acanthias (spiny dogfish), a small shark classed vulnerable to extinction, globally - and, for one population in the north-east Atlantic, endangered, was the main shark being sold at chip shops, under the generic name huss, rock, rock salmon or rock eel.\n\nThe shark was probably imported from areas where stocks are sustainable, and generic names are permitted - but the scientists say it is difficult for customers to tell exactly what type of shark they are eating and where it comes from.\n\n\"It's almost impossible for consumers to know what they are buying,\" said Catherine Hobbs, also of the University of Exeter.\n\n\"People might think they're getting a sustainably sourced product when they're actually buying a threatened species.\"\n\nThe scalloped hammerhead shark was identified among 10 shark fins imported for the UK restaurant trade. The fins are often used to make soup, a celebratory dish in some Asian cuisines.\n\nHow do we know that sharks are ending up on the British dinner plate?\n\nOnce shark meat is processed, it is difficult to tell which species it comes from. Therefore, the scientists carried out DNA tests to see what was entering the human food chain.\n\nThey gathered more than 100 samples from chip shops and supermarkets in southern England. They also looked at dried shark fins imported into the UK.\n\nA type of DNA analysis, known as DNA bar-coding, gave an insight into the shark species on sale.\n\nA fragment of DNA can be matched with an online database known as the bar-code of life to identify the animal.\n\nWhat did the study find?\n\nOf the 78 samples on sale at chips shops in 2016 and 2017, about 90% came from the spiny dogfish.\n\nLanding this shark is generally not permitted under EU rules, although that on sale was probably sourced from more sustainable stocks elsewhere, then imported and frozen, the scientists say.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The spiny dogfish is at threat due to overfishing\n\nOf the 39 fresh and frozen samples obtained from fishmongers, about half were assigned to Mustelus asterias (starry smooth hound), a type of hound-shark. This shark is judged of least concern in terms of extinction risk.\n\nThe Sphyrna lewini (scalloped hammerhead) was found in three of 10 dried shark fins on sale in the UK. These may have been imported and stored before international restrictions came into force in 2014.\n\nThis shark, which is not found in UK waters, is targeted for its fins and is in decline.\n\nCommenting on the study, Simon Walmsley, Chief Marine Adviser at WWF said: \"Endangered shark species shouldn't be ending up on people's plates as their weekend takeaway, particularly the spiny dogfish which is vulnerable and threatened with extinction.\"\n\nWhere is shark meat eaten?\n\nShark meat is eaten across the world and has been part of the human diet for centuries.\n\nBut between 2000 and 2011, global imports of sharks, skates, rays and other cartilaginous fishes rose by 42%, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nThe international trade in 12 species is regulated because of concern over extinction risks.\n\nBut there is debate among scientists over which - if any - sharks can be regarded as sustainable and harvested for food.\n\n\"Sharks are inherently more vulnerable to overfishing because they don't produce many eggs and they take a long time to reach maturity - to be able to produce offspring,\" said Dr Griffiths.\n\nFollow Helen on Twitter."

    "text": "Image copyright Anne Barnetson/CustomerServiceWolf.com Image caption Anne Barnetson uses humour to show how to defuse situations that can make people feel bad\n\nWe've all heard of the saying \"the customer is always right\" but when you work in service industries, what can you do to vent your frustration when the customer is rather annoying?\n\nWhether it's children running riot, requests for the most obscure information, or just plain rude customers, Australian bookshop worker Anne Barnetson has faced it all. But she's come up with a rather novel way of dealing with such awkward situations.\n\nAnne is the creator of Customer Service Wolf, a comic found on Instagram and Tumblr. It gives a humorous anthropomorphic take on life dealing with strangers turning up in bookshops with strange requests.\n\nImage copyright Anne Barnetson/CustomerServiceWolf.com Image caption The wolf is supposed to represent the \"everyman\" and show a whole range of experiences felt by those in customer service\n\nThe images can have a bite to them. Some show the wolf getting so frustrated with unfair demands and indecision that it ends up bounding over the counter and eating the customers, who tend to be rabbits, birds and other prey.\n\n\"It's unenacted fantasies that I think people have after a very long day when they think: 'It would just be great to stop all this right now,'\" laughs Anne, who lives and works in Perth, Western Australia.\n\nShe is, however, keen to stress that she's a lot more polite in real life and the interactions shown are very much exaggerated.\n\nThis is a bit of a relief as one of the more icky comics shows a creature seeking a (made up as far as we can tell) book called Chicken Soup for the Soul: Urine Therapy for Tweens, second edition. The wolf worker's reaction is one of sheer unadulterated horror.\n\nImage copyright Anne Barnetson/CustomerServiceWolf.com Image caption Anne says she would probably recommend barbecue recipe books to any wolves that turned up in the bookshops she works in\n\nAnne says: \"The idea came about when I was working at a bookstore with a good friend and we had nicknames for each other. I was 'Flying Wolf' and she was 'Black Wolf'. She said: 'Wouldn't it be funny if savage predators worked in retail and they could just eat the customers that really irritated them?'\"\n\nImage copyright Anne Barnetson/CustomerServiceWolf.com Image caption The first comic was created for Anne's friend as a gift\n\nShe drew the first strip for her friend in 2012 - an interaction between a wolf worker and an indecisive rabbit - but soon realised that she had a whole hoard of experiences to unleash upon the world.\n\nAnne says it's far safer to draw the characters as animals. \"It gave me free rein to be as humorous and rude as I liked about the interactions I've had with my customers. I'd hate to actually upset anyone.\"\n\nImage copyright Anne Barnetson/CustomerServiceWolf.com Image caption Anne uses humour to show how to defuse situations that can make people feel bad\n\nHowever, she does have friends and colleagues who turn up in the comics.\n\n\"Dr Fox is always happy when he sees himself. Manager Wolf is another repeat character. You can pick him out because he wears a tie, which my boss used to find hilarious. He didn't wear a tie, but still it's about representing middle management.\"\n\nAnne hasn't revealed which bookshops she works in, although she is now starting to get recognition because of the comic strip.\n\n\"Thank goodness no-one has pointed out themselves and said: 'Oh, I'm going to sue for defamation or anything,'\" she says.\n\nPeople who comment on her strips often share their own experiences. \"On my first shift in a bookstore, a lady asked for an orange book but she couldn't remember the title. Or summary. Just 'big orange book',\" says one fellow bookshop worker.\n\n\"My favourite record store repeat request. 'You know that love song they're always playing on the radio. You must know it. They play it all the time,'\" another reader comments.\n\nImage copyright Anne Barnetson/CustomerServiceWolf.com Image caption Anne, a professional illustrator, hopes the comic strip will eventually lead to a book deal\n\nBut what does Anne personally do when dealing with difficult customers, apart from store up the experiences to use as inspiration for the comics?\n\n\"I've found that if you're in customer service, people can be a little condescending or just assume you don't have feelings or will be very impatient. The ones that still make me feel horrible when I think about them are those where I've been properly yelled at, usually by a man.\n\n\"I am definitely not as quick as the wolf. I stumble, get quite awkward, and then fume about it for hours, days and weeks afterwards.\n\n\"That's what's so nice about living out the fantasy in the wolf comics - they are completely instinctual, specialised animals that are quick to act and they don't think about it.\n\n\"But of course, being human is much more awkward, complicated and difficult.\"\n\nAll images courtesy of Anne Barnetson/CustomerServiceWolf.com"

And indeed it was, when they played on the Labi Siffre song I Got The... in 1975 (hear the sample at 2:30 in the track, and below).\n\nBoth Chas and Dave had had long careers in music before becoming stars in the 80s with songs like Aint No Pleasing You and Rabbit. As a session guy, Chas had worked with producer Joe Meek backing rock 'n' rollers Jerry Lee Lewis, Bill Haley and Gene Vincent; Dave played in beat group Cliff Bennett & The Rebel Rousers, who had two Top 10 hits in the 60s.\n\nSiffre - a writer as well as a musician - is best-known for his 1987 No. 4 (Something Inside) So Strong, which he wrote in response to watching a TV documentary about Apartheid in South Africa. In hip hop, though, he's famous for I Got The..., which has also been been sampled by Wu-Tang Clan and Jay-Z.\n\nSiffre, who is gay, refused to pass the sample until homophobic language on the song was removed. \"Diss the bigots not their victims,\" he told the New Humanist in 2012. \"I denied sample rights till that lazy writing was removed. I should have stipulated 'all versions' but at that time knew little about rap's 'clean' and 'explicit' modes, so they managed to get the lazy lyric on versions other than the single and first album.\""

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nMarine life is facing \"irreparable damage\" from the millions of tonnes of plastic waste which ends up in the oceans each year, the United Nations has warned.\n\n\"This is a planetary crisis... we are ruining the ecosystem of the ocean,\" UN oceans chief Lisa Svensson told the BBC.\n\nBut how does this happen, where is most at risk and what damage does this plastic actually do?\n\nWhy is plastic problematic?\n\nPlastic as we know it has only really existed for the last 60-70 years, but in that time it has transformed everything from clothing, cooking and catering, to product design, engineering and retailing.\n\nOne of the great advantages of many types of plastic is that they're designed to last - for a very long time.\n\nAnd nearly all the plastic ever created still exists in some form today.\n\nIn July a paper published in the journal Science Advances by industrial ecologist Dr Roland Geyer, from the University of California in Santa Barbara, and colleagues, calculated the total volume of all plastic ever produced at 8.3bn tonnes.\n\nOf this, some 6.3bn tonnes is now waste - and 79% of that is in landfill or the natural environment.\n\nThis vast amount of waste has been driven by modern life, where plastic is used for many throwaway or \"single use\" items, from drinks bottles and nappies to cutlery and cotton buds.\n\nFour billion plastic bottles...\n\nDrinks bottles are one the most common types of plastic waste. Some 480bn plastic bottles were sold globally in 2016 - that's a million bottles per minute.\n\nOf these, 110bn were made by drinks giant Coca Cola.\n\nSome countries are considering moves to reduce consumption.\n\nProposals in the UK include deposit-return schemes, and the improvement of free-drinking water supplies in major cities, including London.\n\nSo how much plastic waste ends up in the sea?\n\nIt's likely that about 10m tonnes of plastic currently ends up in the oceans each year.\n\nIn 2010 scientists from the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis and the University of Georgia in Athens estimated the figure as 8m tonnes, and forecast that to rise to 9.1m tonnes by 2015.\n\nThe same study, published in the journal Science in 2015, surveyed 192 coastal countries contributing to ocean plastic waste, and found that Asian nations were 13 of the 20 biggest contributors.\n\nChina was top of the list of countries mismanaging plastic waste, but the US also featured in the top 20 and contributed a higher rate of waste per person.\n\nPlastic waste accumulates in areas of the ocean where winds create swirling circular currents, known as gyres, which suck in any floating debris.\n\nThere are five gyres around the globe, but the best known is probably the North Pacific gyre.\n\nMore on this topic:\n\nIt is estimated debris takes about six years to reach the centre of the North Pacific gyre from the coast of the US, and about a year from Japan.\n\nAll five gyres have higher concentrations of plastic rubbish than other parts of the oceans.\n\nThey are made up of tiny fragments of plastic, which appear to hang suspended below the surface - a phenomenon that has led it to being described as plastic soup.\n\nAnd the hard-wearing qualities of most plastics means that some items can take hundreds of years to biodegrade.\n\nHowever, there are moves to clean up the North Pacific gyre. An operation led by a non-profit organisation Ocean Cleanup is due to begin in 2018.\n\nHow bad are things in the UK?\n\nThe Marine Conservation Society found 718 pieces of litter for every 100m stretch of beach surveyed during their recent Great British Beach Clean Up. That was a 10% increase on last year.\n\nRubbish from food and drink constituted at least 20% of all litter collected, the MCS reported.\n\nThe origin of a lot of the litter is difficult to trace, but the public contributes about 30%. \"Sewage-related debris\", or items flushed down toilets that should have been put in the bin, amounted to some 8.5%.\n\nWhy is plastic so harmful to marine life?\n\nFor sea birds and larger marine creatures like turtles, dolphins and seals, the danger comes from being entangled in plastic bags and other debris, or mistaking plastic for food.\n\nTurtles cannot distinguish between plastic bags and jellyfish, which can be part of their diet. Plastic bags, once consumed, cause internal blockages and usually result in death.\n\nLarger pieces of plastic can also damage the digestive systems of sea birds and whales, and can be potentially fatal.\n\nOver time, plastic waste slowly degrades and breaks down into tiny micro-fragments which are also causing scientists concern.\n\nA recent survey by Plymouth University found that plastic was found in a third of UK-caught fish, including cod, haddock, mackerel and shellfish.\n\nThis can result in malnutrition or starvation for the fish, and lead to plastic ingestion in humans too.\n\nThe effect on humans of eating fish containing plastic is still largely unknown.\n\nBut in 2016 the European Food Safety Authority warned of an increased risk to human health and food safety \"given the potential for micro-plastic pollution in edible tissues of commercial fish\".\n\nProduced by Alison Trowsdale, Tom Housden and Becca Meier.

It's not easy, it takes time,\" says Laurie Santos, professor of psychology and cognitive science at Yale University.\n\nProf Santos's class Psychology and the Good Life is the most popular in Yale's 317-year history, and broke the university's enrolment record when more than 1,200 students signed up.\n\n\"Being happy isn't something that just happens, you've got to practice to be better at it,\" she adds.\n\nHere are five exercises from Prof Santos to get you started.\n\n1. Make a gratitude list\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Thanks! Be grateful for the good people and things in your life\n\nProf Santos asks her students to write down what they are grateful for - every night, for a whole week.\n\nThis becomes their gratitude list.\n\n\"It might sound quite simple, but we've seen that the students who regularly do this exercise actually tend to be happier,\" she says.\n\n2. Sleep more and better\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A well-rested person is a happier person - try to get a good eight hours of sleep a night\n\nThe challenge is to sleep eight hours a night, every night, for a whole week.\n\nThis simple exercise proves to be the hardest to achieve, according to Prof Santos.\n\n\"It might seem silly, but we know that sleeping more and better reduces your chances of suffering from depression and improves your positive attitude,\" she says.\n\n3. Meditate\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Meditation is a must - no need to go to a spa - grab 10 minutes anywhere that's quiet\n\nMeditate 10 minutes a day, every day.\n\nProf Santos says that when she used to be a student, regular meditation made her feel better.\n\nNow she's a professor, she refers her students to several studies demonstrating how meditation and other activities that engage your full attention can help you become happier.\n\n4. Spend more time with family and friends\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Be in the present and spend time with people you like\n\nAccording to Prof Santos, there's growing research that shows enjoying quality time with your friends and family makes your happier.\n\nSpending time with people we like - or having \"healthy interpersonal relations and social connections\", in psychology speak - significantly boosts your wellbeing.\n\nIt doesn't take much, says Prof Santos, just make sure you \"live in the moment, be aware you are having this time together, be conscious of how you spend your time\".\n\nThe concept of time is very important for your happiness.\n\n\"We often associate wealth with how much money we have,\" adds Prof Santos, \"but research shows that wealth is more closely tied to how much time we have\".\n\n5. Fewer social networks and more real connections\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Put your phone away and get active\n\nSocial media can give us a false sense of happiness, says Prof Santos, and it is important not to be swept away by it.\n\nThe latest research shows that people who use social networks the most tend to be less happy than those who don't use it so much, she adds."

    "text": "Beneath Jim Anderson\u2019s feet lies a monster. It has been alive since the Persian king Xerxes waged war against the Ancient Greeks and weighs more than three blue whales put together. It has a voracious appetite, eating its way through huge swathes of forest. But this is no long-forgotten beast borne of Greek mythology. It is a mushroom.\n\nAnderson is standing in an unassuming patch of woodland in Crystal Falls, in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula. He is revisiting an organism living under the forest floor that he and his colleagues discovered nearly 30 years ago. This is the home of Armillaria gallica, a type of honey mushroom.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 The truth about nitrates in your food\n\n\u2022 Wet countries that are running dry\n\n\u2022 How meal times affect your waistline\n\nThese common fungi are found in temperate woodlands all across Asia, North America and Europe, where they grow on dead or dying wood, helping to speed up the decay. Often the only visible sign of them above ground are clumps of scaly, yellow-brown toad-stool-like fruiting bodies that grow up to 10cm tall.\n\nWhen Anderson and his colleagues visited Crystal Falls in the late 1980s, they discovered that what at first appeared to be a rich community of Armillaria gallica flourishing beneath the mulch of leaf litter and top soil of the forest floor was \u2013 in fact \u2013 one giant individual specimen. They estimated it covered an area about 91 acres, weighed 100 tonnes and was at least 1,500 years old. It set a new record at the time for the largest organism on the planet \u2013 a similar fungus in a forest in Oregon now holds the record.\n\n\u201cIt caused quite a stir at the time,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cOur paper came out on April Fool\u2019s Day so everyone thought it was a joke. Then in 2015 we thought we should go back and test our prediction that this was truly a persistent, single organism.\u201d\n\nThe new results revealed it was four times larger, 1,000 years older and if gathered together would weigh around 400 tonnes\n\nThey ended up returning to the site several times between 2015 and 2017, taking samples from distant points around the forest and then running the DNA they obtained through a sequencer back at their laboratory at the University of Toronto. Since their initial study in the 1980s, genetic analysis has advanced in bounds, with new techniques making the process far cheaper, faster and providing more information.\n\nTheir new samples revealed that not only was the Armillaria gallica they had discovereda single individual, but it was far larger and older than they had predicted. The new results revealed it was four times larger, 1,000 years older and if gathered together would weigh around 400 tonnes.\n\nBut the analysis produced an even more surprising insight, one that could help us humans in our fight against one of modern medicines greatest foes \u2013 cancer.\n\nThe Canadian researchers discovered what may be the secret behind the Armillaria gallica\u2019sextraordinary size and age. It appears the fungus has an extremely low mutation rate \u2013 meaning it avoids potentially damaging alterations to its genetic code.\n\nAs organisms grow, their cells divide into two to produce new daughter cells. Over time, the DNA in the cells can become damaged leading to errors, known as mutations, creeping into the genetic code. This is thought to be one of the key mechanisms that causes aging.\n\nBut it seems the Armillaria gallica in Crystal Falls might have some inbuilt resistance to this DNA damage. In 15 samples taken from distant parts of the forest and sequenced by the team, just 163 letters of the 100 million in the genetic code of Armillaria gallica had changed.\n\nThe fungus has a mechanism that helps to protect its DNA from damage, giving it one of the most stable genomes in the natural world\n\n\u201cThe mutation frequency is much, much lower than we could ever have imagined,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cTo have this low level of mutation, we would expect the cells to be dividing on average once for every metre of growth. But what is astonishing is that the cells are microscopic \u2013 just a few micrometres in size \u2013 so you would need millions of them in every metre of growth.\u201d\n\nAnderson and his team believe the fungus has a mechanism that helps to protect its DNA from damage, giving it one of the most stable genomes in the natural world. While they have still to unravel exactly what this is, the remarkable stability of the genome of Armillaria gallica could offer new insights into human health.\n\nIn some cancers, mutations can run riot in cells as the normal mechanisms that check for and repair DNA break down.\n\n\u201cArmillaria gallica may provide a potential counterpoint to the notorious instability of cancer,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cIf you looked at a line of cancer cells that were equivalent in age, it would be so riddled with mutations that you probably wouldn\u2019t be able to recognise it. Armillaria is at the opposite extreme. It might be possible to pick out the evolutionary changes that have allowed it be like this and compare them to cancer cells.\u201d\n\nDoing this could not only allow scientists to learn more about what goes wrong in cancer cells but may also provide potential new ways of treating cancer.\n\nWhile Anderson and his colleagues are not planning on doing this work themselves \u2013 they are leaving it to others who are younger and more qualified to understand the genetic complexities of cancer \u2013 their findings provide an intriguing glimpse of the untapped power of fungi to help humanity.\n\nThe combined biomass of fungi exceeds that of all the animals on the planet put together\n\nFungi are some of the most common organisms on our planet \u2013 the combined biomass of these often tiny organisms exceeds that of all the animals on the planet put together. And we are discovering new fungi all the time. More than 90% of the estimated 3.8 million fungi in the world are currently unknown to science. In 2017 alone, there were 2,189 new species of fungi described by scientists.\n\nA recent report published by the UK\u2019s Royal Botanic Gardens Kew in London highlighted that fungi are already used in hundreds of different ways, from making paper to helping to clean our dirty clothes. Around 15% of all vaccines and biologically produced drugs come from fungi. The complex proteins used to trigger an immune response to the hepatitis B virus, for example, are grown in yeast cells, which are part of the fungi family.\n\nPerhaps the most well-known is the antibiotic penicillin, which was discovered in a common type of household mould that often grows on old bread. Dozens of other types of antibiotics are now produced by fungi.\n\nThey are also sources of treatments for migraines and statins for treating heart disease. One relatively new immunosuppressant, used for treating multiple sclerosis, was developed from a compound produced by a fungus that infects cicada larvae.\n\n\u201cIt is part of this family of fungi that get into insects and take them over,\u201d says Tom Prescott, a researcher who evaluates the use of plants and fungi at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew. \u201cThey produce these compounds to suppress the insect immune system and it turns out they can be used in humans too.\u201d\n\nBut some researchers believe we have barely scratched the surface of what fungi can offer us.\n\nCompounds produced by fungi can destroy viruses that cause diseases like flu, polio, mumps, measles and glandular fever\n\n\u201cThere have already been [fungi] reported to have activity against viral diseases,\u201d says Riikka Linnakoski, a forest pathologist at the Natural Resources Institute Finland. Compounds produced by fungi can destroy viruses that cause diseases like flu, polio, mumps, measles and glandular fever. Numerous fungi have also been found to produce compounds that could treat diseases that currently have no cure, such as HIV and the Zika virus.\n\n\u201cI believe these represent just a small fraction of the full arsenal of bioactive compounds,\u201d says Linnakoski. \u201cFungi are a vast source of various bioactive molecules, which could potentially be used as antivirals in the future.\u201d\n\nShe is part of a research team that is investigating whether fungi growing in the mangrove forests of Colombia could be sources of new antiviral agents. These goals have not yet been realised, however. While fungi have been well researched as a source of antibiotics that act against bacteria, no antiviral drugs derived from fungi have been approved.\n\nLinnakoski puts this apparent omission by the scientific community down to the difficulty in collecting and growing many fungi from the natural environment and the historic lack of communication between mycologists and the virology community. But she believes it will only be a matter of time before a fungi-based antiviral drug makes its way into clinics.\n\nLinnakoski also believes that searching for new species of fungi in inhospitable environments such as in the sediment on the sea bed in some of the deepest parts of the ocean, or in the highly changeable conditions of mangrove forests, might yield even more exciting compounds.\n\n\u201cThe extreme conditions are thought to provoke fungi to produce unique and structurally unprecedented secondary metabolites,\u201d she says. \u201cUnfortunately, many of the native ecosystems that harbor great potential for discoveries of novel bioactive compounds, such as mangrove forests, are disappearing at alarming rates.\u201d\n\nA fungus found growing in soil at a landfill site on the outskirts of Islamabad, Pakistan, can rapidly break down polyurethane plastic\n\nBut fungi have uses that can tackle other problems beyond our health.\n\nA fungus found growing in soil at a landfill site on the outskirts of Islamabad, Pakistan, may be a solution to the alarming levels of plastic pollution clogging up our oceans. Fariha Hasan, a microbiologist at Quaid-I-Azam University in Islamabad, discovered the fungi Aspergillus tubingensis can rapidly break down polyurethane plastic.\n\nThese plastics, which used to make a wide range of products including furniture foams, electronics cases, adhesives and films, can hang around in soil and sea water for years. The fungi, however, was found to break it down within a matter of weeks. Hasan and her team are now investigating how to use the fungi for large-scale degradation of plastic waste. Other fungi, such as Pestalotiopsis microspore, which normally grows on rotting ivy leaves, have also been found to have a prodigious appetite for plastic, raising hopes they could be harnessed to tackle our growing waste problem.\n\nIn fact, mushrooms have quite a taste for the pollution we contaminate our world with. Species have been discovered that can clean up oil pollution from soil, degrade harmful heavy metals, consume persistent pesticides and even help to rehabilitate radioactive sites.\n\nMushrooms, however, could also help to avoid the need to use some plastics in the first place.\n\nA number of groups around the world are now attempting to exploit a key feature of fungi \u2013 the vein-like webs of mycelium they produce \u2013 to create materials that can replace plastic packaging. As fungi grow, these mycelium threads branch outwards, to probe into nooks and crannies in the soil, binding it together. They are nature\u2019s glue.\n\nIn 2010, Ecovative Design began exploring how they could use this to bind together natural waste products like rice husks or wood chips to produce an alternative to polystyrene packaging. Their early work has evolved into MycoComposite, which uses left over bits of hemp plant as the base material.\n\nThese are packed into reusable moulds along with fungal spores and flour, which are then left to grow for nine days. As they do so, they produce enzymes that start to digest the waste. Once the material has grown into the desired shape, it is then treated with heat to dry out the material and halt further growth. The resulting mushroom packaging is biodegradable and is already being used by companies such as Dell to package its computers.\n\nThe company has also developed a way of growing mycelium into foams that can be used in trainers or as insulation, and fabrics that mimic leather. Working with sustainable fabrics firm Bolt Threats, it combines waste corn stalks with the mycelium, allowing it to grow into a mat that is tanned and compressed. The whole process takes days rather than the years needed for animal leather.\n\nStella McCartney is among the designers now looking to use this mushroom leather and shoe designer Liz Ciokajlo recently used mycelium to create a modern reimaging of the 1970s Moon Boot fashion trend.\n\nIt is possible to tune the qualities of the mycelium material by altering what it has to digest\n\nAthanassia Athanassiou, a materials scientist at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa, has been using fungi to develop new types of bandage for treating chronic wounds.\n\nBut she has also discovered it is possible to tune the qualities of the mycelium material by altering what it has to digest. The harder a substance is for the fungi to digest \u2013 such as wood chips rather than potato peelings \u2013 the stiffer the resulting mycelium material is, for example.\n\nIt raises the prospect of using fungi for more robust purposes.\n\nCalifornia-based MycoWorks have been developing ways of turning mushrooms into building materials. By fusing wood together with mycelium, they have been able to create bricks that are fire-retardant and tougher than conventional concrete.\n\nTien Huynh, a biotechnologist at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Australia, has been leading a project to create similar fungal brick by combining mycelium from Trametes versicolor with rice hulls and crushed waste glass.\n\nShe says they not only provide a cheap and environmentally friendly building material, but they also help to solve another problem facing many homes in Australia and around the world \u2013 termites. The silica content of the rice and the glass makes the material less appetising to termites, which cause billions of dollars in damage to homes every year.\n\n\u201cIn our research, we have also used the fungi to produce enzymes and new biostructures for different properties including sound absorption, strength and flexibility,\u201d says Huynh. Her team is also working on using fungi to produce chitin \u2013 a substance used to thicken foods and in many cosmetics.\n\n\u201cUsually chitin is processed from shellfish, which has hypoallergenic properties,\u201d she says. \u201cThe fungal chitin does not. We will have more fungal-based products later in the year but it is certainly a fascinating resource underutilised.\u201d\n\nFungi can also be used in combination with traditional building materials to create a \u201csmart concrete\u201d that can heal itself as the fungi grows into any cracks that form, secreting fresh calcium carbonate \u2013 the key raw material in concrete \u2013 to repair the damage.\n\n\u201cThe possibilities for what we might use mycelium for are endless,\u201d says Gitartha Kalita, a bioengineer at Assam Engineering College and Assam Don Bosco University in Guwahati, India. He and his colleagues have been using fungi and hay waste to create an alternative to wood for building. \u201cEverything that we now call agricultural waste is actually an incredible resource that mushrooms can grow on. We have already degraded our environment and so if we can replace the current materials with something that is going to hold up in some sustainable way. They can take our waste and turn it into something which is really valuable for us.\u201d\n\n--\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "text": "Lord Byron\u2019s grandfather was having a bad day.\n\nScurvy had taken down his crew on the HMS Dolphin, forcing them into their hammocks where they swayed in the sticky heat of the tropics as their ship listed slowly across the Pacific.\n\nEager to control the South Atlantic, the British Navy had tasked Admiral Byron with settling an island off the South American coast where ships could resupply, and then finding an alternative route to the East Indies. By the time he finally returned to England, he had set a record for circumnavigating the globe in less than two years; claimed the western Falkland Islands for the Crown; and nearly started a war between Great Britain and Spain in the process.\n\nByron sailed away, marking his frustration onto a new map of the world by naming these atolls the \u2018Islands of Disappointment\u2019\n\nBut after rounding the tip of South America, the explorer confronted the world\u2019s largest body of water: the endless Pacific Ocean. After a month of empty blue horizon, a tiny island appeared. Byron noted the date (Friday 7 June 1765), and joyously described the island\u2019s \u201cbeautiful appearance \u2013 surrounded by a beach of the finest white sand \u2013 and covered with tall trees, which\u2026 formed the most delightful groves\u201d.\n\nThe naval officer watched as his crew crawled onto the deck, \u201cgazing at this little paradise\u201d that was green with abundant young coconuts whose vitamin-rich meat and milk could heal their bleeding gums. Alas, Byron quickly ascertained that it was impossible to land. \u201cI could not forbear standing close round the island with the ship,\u201d he wrote in his daily log. With the high surf and a shallow coral shoreline that dropped starkly into the bottomless blue, there was no safe anchorage.\n\nThen there were the natives, noted Byron, who showed up on the beach brandishing 5m-long spears. The islanders set massive signal fires to warn a neighbouring island of the impromptu invaders. \u201cThe natives ran along the shore abreast of the ship, shouting and dancing,\u201d Byron recalled, waving their long spears as a warning.\n\n\u201cThey would kill us\u2026 if we ventured to go on shore,\u201d wrote Byron, who attempted one more landing in a longboat before giving up. \u201c[They] set up one of the most hideous yells I had ever heard, pointing at the same time to their spears, and poising in their hands large stones which they took up from the beach.\u201d The British made a go at frantic diplomacy by throwing old bread at the islanders, who refused to touch the stale food but instead waded into the water and tried to swamp the longboat.\n\nByron backed off and instead set sail towards the larger neighbouring island, but he again failed to anchor along the ringed coral atoll. Meanwhile, natives armed with spears and clubs followed the longboat in the surf, using \u201cthreatening gestures to prevent their landing\u201d. Byron only convinced the islanders to back off when he shot a 9lb cannonball over their heads. Less than 20 hours after arriving, Byron sailed away, marking his frustration onto a new map of the world by naming these atolls the \u2018Islands of Disappointment\u2019. The map was published following his round-the-world journey, and the moniker has stuck ever since.\n\nRediscovery\n\nI laughed out loud when I first spotted the name in Byron\u2019s sea log during a bout of insomnia, and was instantly hooked, reading line by line through the night until dawn. The name, now commonly listed as \u2018Disappointment Islands\u2019, sounded more like the title of some back-shelf Tintin comic than a real place on Earth. But the name checked out online, pointing to Napuka and Tepoto, a pair of far-flung dots in the South Pacific, etched upon the blue surface of the Tuamotu Archipelago, the largest group of coral atolls on the planet.\n\nPeering down on Google Earth, the smaller of the two Disappointment Islands resembled a single-cell organism floating alone in the ocean. Measuring just 4 sq km, Tepoto is one of the smallest of the 118 islands and atolls that comprise French Polynesia. This green teardrop banded by sandy beach upon a deep blue ribbon is also the tiny island where Byron failed to land. Could I get there, and would I be disappointed, too?\n\nNo hotels, no restaurants, no tourist industry \u2013 it sounded like paradise to me\n\nAnd yet, 254 years after Byron\u2019s attempt, the Disappointment Islands still proved difficult to access. Flights to the larger atoll of Napuka are not even listed on Air Tahiti\u2019s international website. I spent three weeks making cold calls before I got hold of an agent.\n\n\u201cYou can fly to Napuka in February,\u201d she explained in French, \u201cbut then you have to stay a full month.\u201d And so I travelled in the better weather of May, when scheduled flights still gave me a minimum eight-day stay. Located nearly 1,000km from Tahiti\u2019s capital, Papeete, Napuka is one of the most isolated islands in French Polynesia, and a quick stop on a larger circular air route. Once I stepped off the plane, I would have to stay.\n\n\u201cYou should arrange a place to stay beforehand,\u201d my friend Celeste Brash recommended. She had never been to Napuka, but as the author of Lonely Planet\u2019s Tahiti & French Polynesia guidebook, she spoke from personal experience: \u201cThose really remote atolls in the Tuamotus don\u2019t really know what to do when visitors show up.\u201d\n\nNo hotels, no restaurants, no tourist industry \u2013 it sounded like paradise to me. This was my ultimate desire as a traveller: to show up unannounced like those ailing British sailors, open to the naked fate of true exploration. I opted out of scurvy and long months at sea in favour of the 18-hour flight to Tahiti from Washington DC, measured out in cups of fresh pineapple juice poured by flight attendants wearing floral prints. After a night in Papeete, I boarded a two-hour prop plane to Napuka.\n\nJourney\n\nFor the first hour, I watched the empty ocean far below me. The blue intensity astonished me as much as the immensity of the water. Polynesia is believed to be one of the last areas on Earth settled by humans, and that ancient people sailed across this void in narrow canoes from places like Indonesia and the Philippines seemed nearly impossible. Resting my forehead against the vibrating window, I studied the leathery surface of the mid-morning Pacific, basking in that rare moment when stark geographic truths confront you: Polynesia is more ocean than anything else.\n\nFaint white rings of coral atolls appeared \u2013 les \u00eeles basses, or \u2018low islands\u2019 of the Tuamotus. We dropped in tight circles and landed on the atoll of Fakarava, where at least half the 20 passengers departed. Ten minutes later we were back in the air, hovering over an even longer stretch of blue.\n\nAnother hour passed before I recognised tiny Tepoto \u2013 alone in the ocean, single and miniscule, exactly like on my computer screen back home. The plane veered right and the larger atoll of Napuka filled my oval window view, like a turquoise boomerang encircling a long necklace of white coral islets. Right before we landed, I saw a flash of metal rooftops and green palm groves, a few dirt roads and a pointed church steeple.\n\nAs the doors opened, thick, hot air saturated the plane and I dashed across the tarmac and into the shade of the Napuka Airport \u2013 a small, open-air shelter just off the runway, stacked with luggage and cargo. It seemed as if the whole island had come to meet the plane \u2013 the first flight to land in weeks. Families rushed towards us and flung fragrant flower leis around the necks of loved ones. As the lone foreigner, I stood apart, awkwardly watching the ritual of welcome, already feeling invasive and uncomfortable. Though I had travelled 12,000km, a great divide remained. I did not belong in this scene, and everybody there knew it.\n\n\u201cAre you here on holiday?\u201d a younger man asked me in French, heaving a duffle bag into the shade.\n\nI smiled and shrugged. \u201cOui.\u201d It was easier than explaining how late-night Googling and reading the diary of an 18th-Century sea captain had led me to embark on this indulgent quest.\n\nWe chatted. His name was Jack, and he and his colleague Evarii were electronic technicians from Tahiti, servicing all the tsunami warning sirens in French Polynesia. They had come to repair the siren on Tepoto, which is only accessible by boat from Napuka, and like me, they would have to stay eight days before the next flight back. But why had I come? Jack asked me. Where would I stay? Did I understand that there were no \u2018services\u2019 on Napuka?\n\nEvarii seemed annoyed by my presence.\n\n\u201cDo you do this often?\u201d he asked. \u201cJust show up in a place without any plans?\u201d Before I could tell him yes, in fact, this was my favourite way to travel, Jack intervened.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk to la mairesse. We\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d\n\nAs if stepping out of a Gauguin painting, a woman soon approached me with a flowing bright skirt and a wide straw hat pinned with flowers that shaded her face. Her name was Marina and as tavana (\u2018mayor\u2019, in Tahitian) of the 300-person atoll, she oversees everything that happens on Napuka, including every flight that lands at the airport.\n\n\u201cWhy did you not contact us to let us know you were coming?\u201d tavana Marina asked me. \u201cWe have made no arrangements!\u201d I fumbled an unconvincing response, saying that I didn\u2019t want to be a burden.\n\n\u201cDo you want to visit Tepoto?\u201d tavana Marina asked, because a boat had already been organised for the technicians. Yes, I wanted to visit Tepoto. That was Byron\u2019s first elusive island, and aside from the once-a-month supply boat, there was no way to reach it. I jumped at the chance.\n\n\u201cCome with us,\u201d said Jack, smiling. Evarii huffed.\n\n\u201cYou know there\u2019s no water over there!\u201d Evarii mentioned as he looked over my meagre luggage. I knew. I had practically memorised the Wikipedia entry: \u2018These islands are arid, and are not especially conducive to human habitation\u2019. I had a few litres of water in my bag, but it was barely enough for one day, let alone a week.\n\n\u201cWe can share,\u201d Jack said. We drove in the back of tavana Marina\u2019s pickup truck to the short cement dock, where a small metal skiff was hanging by steel cables from a front-loading tractor. I helped load the tiny boat with supplies, including a massive cooler of drinking water the technicians had checked as cargo from Tahiti. In a flash, the front loader dropped the skiff into the water, and two drivers jerked the outboard motors to life. The three of us hopped inside, and with a burst of engine, broke through the surf.\n\nArrival\n\nOut past the reef, the sea was calm with a light swell that rapidly pushed us north-west from Napuka towards the vague horizon. Aside from the wind, the only sound was the buzzing of twin outboard motors that carried our tiny party out into the heart of the ocean. In all my travels and ocean crossings, I had never felt this vulnerable on the water. I was seated on a boat the size of a kitchen table, floating atop the bluest and emptiest part of the globe without a speck of land in sight. The fringe of palms on Napuka had disappeared behind us, and for a solid 10 minutes, the blank horizon met my gaze from every direction, blue upon blue.\n\nAnd yet I felt an inherent trust towards my Polynesian crewmates. I had dropped my life into their hands and watched as they read the changing currents like road signs. Their eyes focused on the horizon and their fingers twitched the angle of the motor by half an inch, this way and that, steering us towards the invisible target of an island so tiny you could miss it and not even know.\n\n\u201cNo GPS!\u201d cried Evarii, shouting over the engine. He nodded to the drivers and tapped the side of his head. \u201cThey just know where to go.\u201d\n\nTwenty minutes and 10km later, a thin green stripe of land pushed up from the water, followed by the white coral beach against the blue-green surf. After another 20 minutes, the island came into full view: coconut palms waving left and right, just as Byron had seen so long ago.\n\nUnlike the admiral, I landed successfully on Tepoto. In time with the rising and falling waves, I hopped onto the short dock and watched another front loader pluck the boat right out from the sea. It made perfect sense that an 18th-Century British tall ship would fail to find harbour here. The island was nothing more than a sharp and shallow reef that dropped off starkly into the dark blue depths, just as Byron had described.\n\n\u201cWelcome to Tepoto,\u201d a man in his late 30s said as he shook my salty hand and introduced himself as Severo, the island\u2019s one and only policeman and the son of tavana Marina back on Napuka. She had called to tell him that I was arriving, and now a party of islanders was coming out to greet us. At the helm was a woman wrapped in a purple muumuu who dropped a string of white Tahitian gardenias around my neck, dousing me in a honey-vanilla perfume.\n\n\u201cBienvenue,\u201d she said, kissing me on both cheeks and introducing herself as Louana.\n\n\u201cMaururu,\u201d I replied in Tahitian. Thank you.\n\nLouana was the tavana of Tepoto, and she led us up from the beach, past the leaning palms to the single row of pastel bungalows that lined the island\u2019s only street, paved with crushed coral stone.\n\n\u201cHave you ever seen a four-headed coconut tree?\u201d a young boy asked me in French, running alongside me.\n\n\u201cNo, I have not,\u201d I answered.\n\nHave you ever seen a four-headed coconut tree?\n\n\u201cWe have one,\u201d an older boy piped in. \u201cIt\u2019s a coconut tree\u2026 with four heads!\u201d\n\nI struggled to follow the excited rush of voices that came at me, each one a weird puzzle piece of information concerning this remarkable four-headed coconut tree \u2013 how nature made it comme \u00e7a \u2013 and how originally the trunk was split into seven heads, but those extra three broke off in a typhoon long ago. Several islanders offered to show me the arboreal wonder.\n\nTwo hours after dropping into the Disappointment Islands without water or plans, I had a place to stay with the visiting technicians in a peeling-pink shack with plywood walls and cut-out squares for windows. Red-orange curtains printed with white hibiscus flowers flapped in the breeze as I sat sweating on the bed, adjusting to the 38C heat. Not only had I landed in Tepoto, but I had been welcomed.\n\nTepoto\n\nMinutes later, Severo buzzed by on his scooter with lunch cooked by his wife Tutapu: pan-fried snapper with rice, peas and coconut bread. The fish had been caught that morning and was more delicious than any I had ever eaten in a restaurant.\n\nWhile we ate, Severo sussed me out. As the island policeman, his job was to keep the peace and look after the welfare of the few dozen inhabitants, he explained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very tranquil here,\u201d he said. \u201cNo real problems.\u201d But now I had shown up and he kept looking into my eyes, as if trying to read my intentions. \u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time we had a visitor. Not for as long as I\u2019ve been here \u2013 over 20 years now.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Severo said that no-one could recall the last time a non-Polynesian had come to Tepoto \u2013 certainly not in their lifetimes. Then, he told me that what I had read on Wikipedia was wrong: there weren\u2019t 62 residents on the island, but closer to 40 now, 13 of which were children under the age of 12.\n\n\u201cYoung people leave,\u201d he explained. Once they turn 12, the French government sends them to boarding school in Hao, another atoll in the Tuamotu Archipelago 390km away. For high school, teenagers go to the main island of Tahiti. Severo had grown up on Napuka and returned there after high school, then married a girl from Tepoto and moved here.\n\n\u201cWhat will you do while you\u2019re here?\u201d Severo asked.\n\n\u201cExplore,\u201d I answered, though I had made no real plans. I had not really thought past the possibility of getting here. Now that I had actually made it, the coming days confronted me. \u201cWait until it\u2019s cooler,\u201d he advised.\n\nI dozed through the hot, humid afternoon and heard no other sounds except my own slow breathing that seemed to follow the rhythm of the whispering surf and listing palms. At 16:00, I followed the sound of a tinkling bell across the road, where most of the islanders sat on outdoor benches facing a shrine covered in garlands of flowers and chains of seashells. A musician played a guitar in one corner while the island\u2019s nurse stood up and led the congregation in a strong and harmonious hymn.\n\nStill singing, a woman moved to one side, offering to share her bench with me. The Catholic mass lasted a full hour, rotating through chants and readings and hymns \u2013 all in Tahitian. Afterwards, the lady explained that this was the holy week of pilgrimage when islanders gathered twice a day before the Virgin Mary, the angelic figurine at the centre of the elaborate floral decor.\n\n\u201cWe are lucky here on Tepoto,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no war. No crime.\u201d There were no real problems at all, she mused, lighting a hand-rolled cigarette. She also told me there was no running water or internet, and very limited electricity. Tepoto received its first solar panels and electric power in 1995, and a mobile phone tower within the last five years.\n\n\u201cHave you ever seen a four-headed coconut tree?\u201d she asked me, point blank.\n\n\u201cNo, I have not.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have one here, maybe the only one in the world,\u201d she said with an air of mystery before saying goodbye and returning to her bungalow to untangle a hairy pig tied by one leg to a palm tree.\n\nNight fell fast and the stars blew me away. I gawked upwards from the empty beach as if catching the night sky for the first time, the Milky Way scrawled like a diagonal swath of pink gauze.\n\nThe bell woke me before dawn, calling believers to another Catholic mass. This time I opted out and walked to the end of the one road, past the fanning palms and out to the coral shoreline. The sun rose behind me and lit up the sea like silver. I continued southwards, walking the length of the 2.6km island and admiring the tidal pools that housed tiny worlds of maroon-speckled crabs and green fish. Blue-eyed clams lay cemented in the rust-coloured coral and seabirds soared overhead.\n\nMassive white-stone crosses marked the cardinal points of the island, while the windward stretch of beach showed a collage of remnants that had floated in from the outside world: a whisky bottle; Chinese pharmaceuticals; a cracked CD case; a bottle of Japanese salad dressing; and a barnacled tennis shoe. I considered the long journey of the driftwood that now rested on this bit of shore. Where had it come from \u2013 Asia, the Americas or New Zealand? Tepoto was like some forgotten punctuation mark between all three.\n\nIn three decades of travelling, I had never encountered such a raw and solitary place. The empty beaches and silent palm groves seemed timeless, as though a mirage of Byron\u2019s ship still hovered somewhere off in the warm, salty breeze. I had seen this island depicted on old atlases and my grandfather\u2019s globe and had somehow transported myself here \u2013 and yet, even my own footprints seemed implausible, as if I had stepped from my own reality into some far-flung dream state.\n\nWithin days, I fell into the forced simplicity of the island: sleeping under a single cotton sheet; sipping instant coffee made using rainwater drained from the roof; eating raw clams; and then exploring every short footpath on the island. I bathed with a dipper of water from the rain barrel. Under the shade of trees and front porch roofs, I talked with the islanders and listened to their stories. At times I grew painfully thirsty, but kept silent, never asking for a drink. Yet somehow, the islanders always knew, sending their kids to gather fresh coconuts and then chopping them open and urging me to hydrate. I offered to pay and was always refused. In fact, I only handled money once, to pay Severo for my room and board.\n\nNews that a foreigner had landed and was staying in the pink bungalow near the dock drifted across the tiny island. Occasionally, a few people stopped by in the evening to say hello, offer me a tour of the island or to ask me earnest questions. \u201cHow many houses do you have you in your town?\u201d. \u201cAre you a Christian?\u201d. At times when I went off to explore, I caught glimpses of watchful eyes, peering at me through the palm fronds. They knew I was under the policeman\u2019s care but remained on alert. I reacted by living with total transparency, down to my underwear drying on the clothesline.\n\nWhen it grew too warm, I swam in the ocean, the islanders watching from shore. Wearing goggles, I caught the flash of colour and life that swam beneath the waves \u2013 pastel fish whose scales matched the row of humble houses on Tepoto. Mounds of spiky coral glowed neon-like, healthy and unbroken, spared from the careless destruction of men.\n\nThis media cannot be played on your device.\n\nPerhaps Byron\u2019s disappointment had sheltered this place from the rest of the world, preserving it to this day. I\u2019d seen the bleached and broken coral reefs of Bora Bora and Tahiti, where too much love has ruined the natural paradise that first put Polynesia on the tourist map. But here, halfway between the Marquesas and the main Tuamotu island groups, Tepoto has remained comparatively unblemished. I felt lucky to glimpse the vibrant and teeming underwater life, knowing that millions of tourists would visit the rest of Polynesia and never see this kind of virgin reef.\n\nNor would they ever see the four-headed coconut tree. After days of anticipation, I received a personal invitation from three schoolboys \u2013 Tuata, Tearoha and Sylvain \u2013 who escorted me to the mayor\u2019s office where the technicians were finishing up their work on the tsunami warning signal.\n\nA stumpy tractor with a wide shovel (the island\u2019s only vehicle) had been dispatched for our adventure. Sylvain\u2019s father Andr\u00e9 drove, while I rode inside the shovel with the technicians. In all, there were eight of us clinging to the tractor as we manoeuvred and bumped our way into the dense coconut grove at the island\u2019s centre.\n\nCoconuts are the only cash crop on Tepoto, and as we pushed through the forest, I noticed small piles of halved coconuts, thick with hairy husks, drying in the sun. The oily white flesh, called copra, earns a fixed rate of 140 local francs (about \u00a31) per kilogram, and is carried away once a month aboard a supply ship. Every islander has the right to collect and sell copra for cash, but Andr\u00e9 explained that the coconut trees had begun to die. A small invasive beetle was killing them, he said, making the leaves fall off and leaving bare, toothpick trunks poking into the air.\n\nAfter 20 minutes driving through the grove, the tractor stopped and the engine cut. I looked up and there it was, skinny and circumspect, barely noticeable except for the four branches that spun out from its base. The long fronds waved back in the wind.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the four-headed coconut tree!\u201d Tearoha shouted like a carnival barker. I stood in awe at the oddity before us and wondered how it came to be. By now I had heard the story from nearly every human on the island, how there had been seven branches, but three had broken off in the last major typhoon. The men began to recall different storms that had flattened the forest of trees in hours, and how the old people could predict a typhoon just from watching the birds. In the past, the islanders latched themselves to coconut palms to keep from being blown away by the gale-force winds. Now they had a siren triggered automatically from hundreds of kilometres away and the stone church to protect them.\n\nWe took the long way back to the village, continuing first to the southern tip of the island. Andr\u00e9 pointed towards Napuka in the east, and standing on land instead of crouching in a boat, I could barely see it over the waves. A baby black-tipped reef shark hunted in the shallows, zipping after the schools of smaller fish.\n\nWe followed the beach around towards the pink sunset, and I caught sight of my own footprints from days before \u00ad\u2013 the only footprints on that side of the island. Just like Byron had marked his disappointment on a map of the world, I had left my own impressions in the sand of Tepoto. Another tide and my trail would be erased and redrawn with the winding trails of seabirds and coconut crabs.\n\nAndr\u00e9 stopped the tractor in front of his turquoise bungalow and leaned against a palm trunk. With a few swift chops of his machete, he hacked down fresh coconuts for all of us and handed me a whole litre of coconut water.\n\n\u201cWe may not have water,\u201d said Andr\u00e9, \u201cbut we can always drink coconuts.\u201d\n\nThat night, Andr\u00e9, Severo and some of the other men of Tepoto gathered outside our pink house to drink beer and talk fishing. They spoke a mix of French, Tahitian and the local Tuamotuan language of Paumotu. I strained to fully understand their epic tales of catching bonito by the hundreds \u2013 the same bonito I had been served that day for lunch, raw, but with chopped onions and coconut milk.\n\n\u201cHere, a gift,\u201d said Joseph, a fisherman who handed me a handmade lure that he used to catch bonito. The sharpened metal hook was decorated with a carved mother-of-pearl spinner and a wild pig\u2019s tail. In return, I gave him my goggles.\n\nThis was a tiny solar-powered island without internet, cars or Starbucks. The technicians and I were the only outside influence, and I tried to make it count. During my last two days on Tepoto I taught Tuata and Tearoha how to play chess. The elementary school had a chessboard, but none of the children knew how to play. After hours of instruction, I had them play against one another. That night, Evarii challenged me to a game and we played into the evening. One by one, the Tahitian technician killed my pieces until only my tall white king remained, chased in circles by the black king and bishop.\n\n\u201cCheckmate,\u201d Evarii said.\n\n\u201cNo, wait,\u201d Jack intervened in French. \u201cC\u2019est la nulle.\u201d It was a draw. Neither of us had won. My plastic king was destined to wander the board aimlessly, and Evarii would never have the satisfaction of killing me. He went off to sulk in the last sunset I saw on Tepoto, when the sky lit up blue and green, then peach, rose and orange. Wood smoke scented the air and shooting stars lit the night. Jack played the ukulele, singing lovelorn Polynesian songs along with our hosts until well past midnight.\n\nNapuka\n\nThe next morning, the men launched the boat into the surf, lowering it with the tractor and plopping it into the turquoise shallow at just the right moment. Severo\u2019s in-laws came with us. From time to time, they liked to visit family on Napuka.\n\n\u201cYou are welcome anytime,\u201d said tavana Louana, dropping a string of polished cowrie shells around my neck.\n\n\u201cYes, come stay with us again,\u201d said Severo, adding another necklace. Andr\u00e9 and the other islanders came and added their own hand-strung necklaces. By the time I climbed into the wobbling boat, my head bowed forward with the weight of shells around my neck. Five minutes later, Tepoto was nothing more than a whisper of green on the blue ocean.\n\nI spent three more days on Napuka, adjusting to the sudden noise and crowds of this 200-person metropolis. Severo\u2019s mother-in-law had warned me, \u201cOn Tepoto, we don\u2019t lock our doors, but on Napuka, we lock them.\u201d Two hundred people were too many to trust, and unlike Tepoto, there were cars and at least three streets including the road to the airport.\n\nWhether he was assigned or volunteered, the island\u2019s fireman became my escort on Napuka. His name was tattooed across his muscled chest \u2013 Marama \u2013 and within an hour of landing, he had me knee-deep in the lagoon while he cracked open a live clam.\n\n\u201cEat it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to taste how good our clams are.\u201d\n\nI reached into the shell and pulled at the cool, gelatinous animal. Then I plopped it in my mouth, squishing down and biting through the salty and slimy flesh.\n\n\u201cMore. You left the best part,\u201d Marama said. I cleaned out the shell and then slurped the juice like an oyster. Marama beamed. Was this some kind of test?\n\n\u201cMost foreigners would never agree to eat a raw clam like you did,\u201d Marama said. \u201cBut this is our culture. This is how we survive out here. You showed that you respect us.\u201d\n\nI did respect them, but on Tepoto, I had also been eating clams for every meal \u2013 raw, pickled, cooked and curried. I never foraged on my own; to take anything from the island would be stealing, I thought. The islanders enforced their own quotas, but shared whatever they pulled from the sea with me.\n\nMarama told me he was on the Napuka island council that regulated the gathering of clams and coconuts. When there was no other food to be had, there would always be clams, and it was his job to maintain a sustainable population of both clams and coconuts.\n\n\u201cHow did you hear about Napuka?\u201d Marama asked me, as we walked back towards town. I told him that I had read about the islands in a very old book.\n\n\u201cByron?\u201d asked Marama with a smirk.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I answered. \u201cByron came here in 1765.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d said Marama, \u201cthe people here are not very happy with Byron. He called us \u2018The Islands of Disappointment\u2019, right?\u201d He laughed, \u201cI wish people knew the truth about this place. You really have to know the people to understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd now that I\u2019ve been here, I know that Byron was wrong.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it seemed impossible to feel disappointed in the scene that enveloped me at that moment. The sky seemed Photoshopped with evenly-spaced clouds, and the lagoon glowed the colour of California swimming pools. Twenty metre-high coconut palms danced slowly, and I had just made a new friend who would take me fishing the next day and then swimming at his favourite beach. He would introduce me to dozens of new friends, including Maoake Tuhoe, one of the oldest men on the island, who claimed I was the first foreigner he remembers coming to Napuka since, \u201cthose Peruvians passed by in that boat.\u201d\n\nUpon further questioning, I discovered \u2018those Peruvians\u2019 were, in fact, a group of explorers aboard a raft led by Norwegian Thor Heyerdahl in 1947 that washed up in the Tuamotus 72 years ago.\n\nMarama would be there on the day I left, gifting me a necklace he had strung with large, fragrant flowers and kissing me on both cheeks like a brother. And I would leave him my favourite cowboy hat, the one that kept me from getting burned in the scorching South Pacific sun. He wore it as he waved to me on the plane.\n\nBack\n\nIt took a day of island hopping to get back to Tahiti, where I felt overwhelmed by everything: the traffic, the streetlights, the tourists and even the hot running water in my hotel bathtub. I had filled notebooks and hard drives with words and images from Napuka to Tepoto and back again, but I wanted a more professional opinion.\n\n\u201cThe Byron story is the only recorded account we have in which the Europeans arrived, yet failed to make contact with the natives,\u201d said Jean Kap\u00e9, who grew up on Napuka and now serves as director of Tahiti\u2019s l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Paumotu, which is dedicated to preserving the language, culture and environment of the Tuamotu Islands. I had met Kap\u00e9\u2019s brother in Napuka, and he had connected the two of us.\n\nResponding to Byron\u2019s sense of disappointment, Kap\u00e9 said: \u201cIf someone from somewhere else gives their opinion about a place, it\u2019s already false, because that opinion is only based on what they know.\u201d\n\nByron\u2019s unsuccessful landing represents the ultimate missed connection \u2013 a spark of static that failed to ignite. And yet, his failure may have spared Napuka the same fate as many islands in the South Pacific.\n\n\u201cNapuka [and Tepoto] are the last places where you can witness the original vegetation of the Tuamotu islands,\u201d Kap\u00e9 said. The Paumotu language, which is only still spoken by an estimated 6,000 people, is also alive there, along with their customs \u2013 one of which is unbridled hospitality towards the rare visitors they receive from nearby islands.\n\n\u201c[Welcoming others] is sacred to Polynesians. It is the soul of all humanity,\u201d Kap\u00e9 said. \u201cBut too often with history, foreigners are the ones holding the pen, hence a name like \u2018The Disappointment Islands.\u2019 But even Napuka and Tepoto are just nicknames. The islands\u2019 real names tell a much fuller story of the place you just visited.\u201d\n\nI cannot pretend to fully understand, or worse, attempt to convey such a beautiful and complex history\n\nWe talked for hours, Kap\u00e9 and I. Over and over, he tried to explain the islands\u2019 many Polynesian names, like Te Puka Runga, \u201cThe Tree Where the Sun Rises\u201d (Napuka); and Te Puka Raro, \u201cThe Tree Where the Sun Sets\u201d (Tepoto), deciphering the complex dialect and the multiple hidden meanings behind each name. It encompassed centuries of stories that stretch back to the original inhabitants and their worldview when their universe was nothing more than the two islands, the surrounding ocean and the big sun that moved overhead.\n\nI listened carefully and took notes, but I cannot pretend to fully understand, or worse, attempt to convey such a beautiful and complex history with my own words. Rather than repeat Byron\u2019s mistake of trying to name them from my limited understanding, I will keep silent \u2013 not from disappointment or neglect or laziness, but out of respect for this little piece of the world, unknown to so many, even in French Polynesia.\n\nI thanked Kap\u00e9 for his generous time and shook his hand. Then he gave me a lift back into the centre of Papeete, where throngs of French and American tourists dug through racks of floral print shirts and souvenir tribal tattoos.\n\n\u201cI forgot to ask,\u201d Kap\u00e9 said as I opened the door of his car. \u201cOn Tepoto, did they show you the four-headed coconut tree?\u201d\n\nTravel Journeys is a BBC Travel series exploring travellers\u2019 inner journeys of transformation and growth as they experience the world.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

    ],
    "text": "I am sitting at my desk with my eyes closed, moving a dinner plate back and forth in front of my face while repeating \u201cTest! Test! Test!\u201d. It may look eccentric, but I am trying to teach myself the fascinating skill of echolocation: navigating the world by echo, just like a bat, or a dolphin.\n\nEcholocation has gained prominence in recent years as a skill that some blind people use to map their surroundings with astonishing precision. They can detect trees, buildings or doorways by making a clicking sound with their mouth and listening for the echo.\n\nBut research has shown that the basics of orienting yourself this way can be learned by anyone, blind or sighted. A growing body of research encourages us to expand our sensory potential \u2013 awakening senses that have been neglected, suppressed, or even considered outside the human realm.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 How your language reflects the senses you use\n\n\u2022 The woman with a strange \u2018second sight\u2019\n\n\u2022 The words that change what colours we see\n\nHuman echolocation has been known as a concept since the 1940s. But it has only been studied systematically in the last decade, both as a potentially life-changing skill for blind people and as a way of examining how our brain deals with sensory information.\n\n\u201cWe measure the best possible human echolocators, what we refer to as \u2018echo experts\u2019,\u201d says Lore Thaler, a psychology professor at Durham University and one of the world\u2019s leading experts on human echolocation. \u201cThese are typically people who\u2019ve used it for a long time and show just really good acuity. They can do things which, if you\u2019re new to this, you just cannot do.\u201d\n\nAudio-visual\n\nJust by using mouth clicks, echo experts can detect whether a disc one metre away from them has been shifted by about the width of a finger. They can tell whether an object 2m (6ft 6in) away is a lamppost, car or tree. Even those quite new to the skill can detect a wall more than 30m (98ft) away.\n\nThis does not mean echolocation provides people the same accuracy as vision. Some bat species can use ultrasound to hunt moths, but human echolocators struggle to track such tiny targets. And since echolocation only works for three-dimensional objects, it cannot be used to read printed texts, for example.\n\nHowever, Thaler says it is still a very powerful technique. Used alongside traditional aids such as a cane or a guide dog, it can be transformative for blind people, her research has shown. It can help them travel more safely, avoid obstacles at head level, even recognise their own porch. \u201cIt\u2019s these little things that can make a difference to how confident someone is, and if they are happy to go out,\u201d she says.\n\nAlthough Thaler is sighted, she can echolocate and has taught the technique to blind adults and even children as young as three.\n\n\u201cIf you are in a sighted world, like we are, and then you lose your vision, you really lose a whole lot in terms of how you can access things and how you can move around,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving echolocation in there makes it much easier, because it gives you more control over the space you\u2019re exploring.\u201d\n\nIf you want to have a go, try the experiment with a plate or tray. Close your eyes, start speaking or making a clicking sound, and move it back and forth and from side to side. Listen for the change in sound.\n\nWithout opening your eyes, you will gradually be able to tell where the plate is. As a next step, Thaler recommends slowly rotating in a corner, eyes closed, and using your sound to tell whether you are facing the wall, or the room.\n\nWhen sighted people learn to navigate by sound, they engage the part of their brain that usually deals with vision\n\nThaler and her colleagues are currently studying brain scans of sighted and blind people learning to echolocate. So far, preliminary results have shown something rather startling: when sighted people learn to navigate by sound, they engage the part of their brain that usually deals with vision.\n\n\u201cWe like to think of vision as a sense that\u2019s by itself, and we have certain resources dedicated to it,\u201d such as the eyes and specific parts of the brain, says Thaler. But instead, our brain may be able to process sensory information somewhat more flexibly \u2013 \u201cseeing\u201d with our ears, if you like. It\u2019s just that usually, for sighted people, there is no reason to do so.\n\nAs Thaler points out: \u201cIf you are a sighted person, most of the time you get the spatial stuff through vision. There\u2019s very little incentive to extend your sensory repertoire, because you get by with vision. So why bother?\u201d\n\nSensory teamwork\n\nIn everyday life, our real sensory superpower lies not in any individual skill, but their combination. This is because each sense is relatively weak on its own.\n\n\u201cOftentimes people are quite surprised, when they are forced to use just one [sense] in one way, how bad they are at it,\u201d says James Negen, a research associate in the department of psychology at England\u2019s Durham University.\n\nOur peripheral vision, for example, is rather poor. But we can combine it with another sense, like hearing, to make out where something is \u2013 an approaching car, for example. This is known as the \u201cbimodal precision advantage\u201d, and can be crucial to something as simple as safely crossing the road.\n\nBut there\u2019s a snag: children do not yet have this skill.\n\n\u201cChildren under 10, even children in infancy, do a lot of stuff that requires putting together what they\u2019re seeing and what they\u2019re hearing, or what they\u2019re feeling and what they\u2019re seeing, all these different multi-sensory processes,\u201d says Negen. \u201cBut this very specific thing, where you coordinate the two to be more precise than with either alone \u2013 children have failed to show that effect in lots of studies.\u201d\n\nFor children who have lost some of their eyesight, this can make it hard to benefit from echolocation. Adults can use the technique together with their remaining vision, and do better than with either sense alone. Children generally cannot do this. They tend to tune either into their vision, or their hearing. The question is whether they can be taught to use both.\n\nNegen and his team succeeded in doing this in a lab setting. They gave children detailed feedback on how they used each sense in a task. The children were then able to combine the senses like an adult and make more accurate judgements. Further research could show whether such training has a lasting effect.\n\nI am continuing my own experiments with echolocation, using Lore Thaler\u2019s advice for beginners. My biggest achievement so far has been to make it through a doorway with my eyes closed, without touching the sides. It\u2019s strange to think that this ability has been inside me all my life, unused and unnoticed, until a quirky experiment with a porcelain plate brought it out.\n\nWho knows what other hidden senses are waiting to be discovered?\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "text": "Image copyright PA Image caption Low water levels at Wayoh Reservoir near Bolton in the UK heatwave in July 2018\n\nWithin 25 years England will not have enough water to meet demand, the head of the Environment Agency is warning.\n\nThe impact of climate change, combined with population growth, means the country is facing an \"existential threat\", Sir James Bevan told the Waterwise Conference in London.\n\nHe wants to see wasting water become \"as socially unacceptable as blowing smoke in the face of a baby\".\n\n\"We all need to use less water and use it more efficiently,\" he said.\n\nSir James Bevan was appointed chief executive of the Environment Agency - the public body responsible for protecting the environment and wildlife in England - in 2015 after a career as a diplomat.\n\nHe told his audience that, in around 20 to 25 years, England would reach the \"jaws of death - the point at which, unless we take action to change things, we will not have enough water to supply our needs\".\n\nImage caption \"We won't have long term water security unless all of us change our behaviour,\" Sir James said\n\nBy Roger Harrabin, BBC Environment Analyst\n\nThe tone of Sir James' warnings is more strident than we're used to. Phrases like \"existential threat\" and \"jaws of death\" are, he admits, designed to jolt people into facing uncomfortable truths.\n\nThe problem is the unfortunate combination of growing population and potentially shrinking supply by 2040.\n\nThat implies a suite of tough decisions like persuading consumers and firms to use less water.\n\nThe most pressing decisions, though, are over hardware. Infrastructure developments like giant pipes transferring water to the South East will be years in the planning. There's a risk to wildlife, too.\n\nBut most controversial are plans for reservoirs. Locals have been fighting one in South Oxfordshire since the 1990s. Protestors say they acknowledge the water shortage problem but believe water firms are exaggerating the level of population growth.\n\nWhat's more, they say, reservoirs in a water shortage area like the Thames Valley is not a wise solution. And they will fight on.\n\n'Use 40 litres less a day'\n\nAlongside action being taken by the government, water companies and regulators, Sir James wants the public to use less water, and use it more efficiently.\n\nCurrently, people in England use an average of 140 litres of water a day. Sir James is calling on people to cut their usage to 100 litres - the target set by Waterwise, which campaigns for water efficiency.\n\n\"In the last few decades we've radically changed behaviour on smoking (everybody did it) and seatbelts (nobody wore them),\" he is expected to say.\n\n\"In the last two years we've changed behaviour on plastic. We need water wastage to be as socially unacceptable as blowing smoke in the face of a baby or throwing your plastic bags into the sea.\"\n\nSir James' list of 'things we can all do'\n\nGet a low-flush toilet\n\nTake short showers, not deep baths\n\nUse the most efficient shower-head\n\nGet a water-efficient washing machine\n\nDon't use your dishwasher until it's full\n\nTurn the tap off when brushing your teeth\n\nDon't water your lawn (it will survive)\n\n\"If by 2050 we reduced per capita consumption to 100 litres a day, leakage by 50%, and did nothing else, it would provide enough water for an additional 20 million people without taking any more from the environment,\" Sir James said.\n\nSir James in his speech declined to get embroiled in the political arguments over whether water companies should remain privatised or be taken back into public ownership.\n\nHowever, he did say that the present companies needed to up their game - on fixing leaks, bearing down on pollution and making the necessary investments that would future-proof the water delivery system.\n\nNeed for new reservoirs\n\nAnd as well as reducing demand for water, he also called for a big push on maximising its supply.\n\nThis, he said, would include:\n\nWater transfers between regions, from areas of water surplus to areas of deficit\n\nDesalination plants that convert brackish water from into clean drinking water\n\nNew reservoirs to be built to hold water for use in times of severe water stress\n\n\"We have not built a new reservoir in the UK for decades, largely because clearing all the planning and legal hurdles necessary is so difficult and local opposition so fierce,\" he explained.\n\nBut, Sir James argued, the economic case for greater resilience was clear, citing a 2016 Environment Agency report that found \"that while a severe drought would cost each household more than \u00a3100, the cost per household of the investment that would greatly reduce the risk was only \u00a34 a year.\"\n\nThe Environment Agency has previously warned of water shortages by 2050 and the government has already suggested that people's water use should be reduced, in its 25-year plan published last year.\n\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have separate public bodies responsible for environment protection, because the environment is a devolved matter."

    "text": "If you mindlessly scroll through Instagram or Facebook whenever you get a few seconds of downtime, you\u2019re far from alone. But have you ever wondered how all those images of other people\u2019s bodies \u2013 whether your friend\u2019s holiday snap or a celebrity\u2019s gym selfie \u2013 could be affecting how you view your own?\n\nMuch has been made over the years about how mainstream media presents unrealistic beauty standards in the form of photoshopped celebrities or stick-thin fashion models. Now that influencers fill up our feeds, it's easy to imagine that social media, too, is all bad when it comes to body image.\n\nBut the reality is more nuanced, and there may be ways to curate your Instagram feed to make you feel happier in your own skin \u2013 or, at least, stop you feeling worse.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u25cf Is social media bad for you? The knowns and unknowns\n\n\u25cf Why it pays to declutter your digital life\n\n\u25cf How much is \u2018too much time\u2019 on social media?\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that research into social media and body image is still in its early stages, and most studies are correlational. This means we can\u2019t prove whether, for example, Facebook causes someone to have negative feelings about their appearance, or whether people who are concerned about their appearance are more likely to use Facebook.\n\nThat being said, using social media does appear to be correlated with body image concerns. A systematic review of 20 papers published in 2016 found that photo-based activities, like scrolling through Instagram or posting pictures of yourself, were a particular problem when it came to negative thoughts about your body.\n\nBut there are many different ways to use social media \u2013 are you just consuming what others post, or are you taking, editing and uploading selfies? Are you following close friends and family, or a laundry list of celebrities and influencers?\n\nResearch suggests that who we compare ourselves to is key.\n\n\u201cPeople are comparing their appearance to people in Instagram images, or whatever platform they're on, and they often judge themselves to be worse off,\u201d says Jasmine Fardouly, a postdoctoral researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia.\n\nIn a survey of 227 female university students, women reported that they tend to compare their own appearance negatively with their peer group and with celebrities, but not with family members, while browsing Facebook. The comparison group that had the strongest link to body image concerns was distant peers, or acquaintances.\n\nFardouly puts this down to the fact that people present a one-sided version of their life online. If you know someone well, you\u2019ll know they\u2019re only showing the best bits \u2013 but if they\u2019re an acquaintance, you won\u2019t have any other information to go on.\n\nNegative influence\n\nWhen it comes to the wider circle of influencers and accounts you follow, not all types of content are equal.\n\nResearch suggests that \u201cfitspiration\u201d images in particular \u2013 which typically feature beautiful people doing exercise, or at least pretending to \u2013 might make you harsher on yourself.\n\nAmy Slater, an associate professor at the University of West England, Bristol, published a study in 2017 in which 160 female undergraduates viewed either #fitspo, self compassion quotes, or a mix of both, all sourced from real accounts on Instagram. Those who viewed only #fitspo scored lower on self-compassion, but those who viewed the compassionate quotes (e.g. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect just the way you are\u201d) were nicer to themselves \u2013 and felt better about their bodies.\n\nFor those who viewed both the #fitspo and the self-compassion quotes, the benefits of the latter appeared to outweigh the negatives of the former.\n\nAnother study published earlier this year involved showing 195 young women either body-positive content from popular accounts like @bodyposipanda, photos showing thin women in bikinis or fitness gear, or neutral images of nature. The researchers found that exposing women to #bodypositive Instagram content appeared to boost their satisfaction with their own bodies.\n\n\u201cThose two things together are starting to build a little bit of a story that there may be some content that actually is useful for body image,\u201d says Slater.\n\nBut there may be a downside to body-positive images, too: they\u2019re still focusing on bodies. The same study found that women who\u2019d seen the body-positive photos still ended up objectifying themselves \u2013 measured when, after looking at the images, the participants were asked to write 10 statements about themselves. The more the statements focussed on their appearance rather than their skills or personality, the higher that participant scored on self-objectification.\n\nThat means when someone wrote \u201cI am beautiful\u201d it got lumped in with negative things people said about their bodies. But those people could be taking a broader view of where their beauty comes from, including internal as well as physical attributes, says Slater.\n\nEither way, this fixation with looks is a criticism of the body-positive movement that does seem to hold true. \u201cIt is about loving the body, but it is still very much about a focus on appearance,\u201d says Fardouly.\n\nSelf(ie) love\n\nWhen it comes to posting our own pictures on social media, selfies tend to be the focus.\n\nFor a study published last year, Jennifer Mills, an associate professor at York University, Toronto, asked female undergraduates to take a selfie on an iPad and upload it to either Facebook or Instagram. One group could only take a single picture and upload it without editing, but the other had a chance to take as many as they wanted and retouch their selfie using an app.\n\nMills and her colleagues found that all the selfie takers felt less attractive and less confident after posting than when they\u2019d walked into the experiment \u2013 even those who\u2019d been allowed to edit their photos to their heart\u2019s content. \u201cEven though they can make the end result look \u2018better\u2019, they still are focused on aspects of what they don't like about the way they look,\u201d she says.\n\nSome of the participants wanted to know if anyone had liked their photo before deciding how they felt about having posted it, although looking at interactions wasn\u2019t part of the study.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this rollercoaster of feeling anxious and then getting reassurance from other people that you look good,\u201d says Mills. \u201cBut that probably doesn\u2019t last forever, and then you take another selfie.\u201d\n\nIn previous work published in 2017, researchers found that spending a lot of time perfecting selfies could be a sign that someone is struggling with body dissatisfaction.\n\nStill, some big holes remain in the research on social media and body image.\n\nMost of the work so far has focused on young women, as traditionally they have been the age group most affected by body image concerns. But research including men is starting to show they\u2019re not immune. For example, a study found that men who reported looking at male #fitspo content more frequently said they compared their own appearance to others more often and cared about having muscles more.\n\nLonger term research is also an important next step, because lab experiments can only provide a snapshot of any possible effects. \u201cWe don't really know whether over time [social media] has a cumulative effect on people or not,\u201d says Fardouly.\n\nSo, for now, how should you curate your own social media feeds if you don\u2019t want to come away feeling bad about your body?\n\nMills has one takeaway that should work for everyone: put down your phone.\n\n\u201cTake a break and engage in other activities that have nothing to do with appearance and comparing yourself to other people,\u201d she says.\n\nThe next best thing would be to think critically about who you follow \u2013 and, if you find yourself facing an endless stream of appearance-focussed photos next time you scroll, add some nature or travel into the mix.\n\nAfter all, giving up social media altogether is probably too big of an ask for most people \u2013 especially while the long term effects of using it are still unclear. But finding inspiring landscapes, delicious food, and cute dogs to fill your Instagram feed might just help you remember there\u2019s more to life than what you look like.\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

There doesn't seem to be an end in sight.\n\n\"Rather than focusing on buying initiatives like Help To Buy, there needs to be more concentration on the renting situation and how best to support people who are vulnerable.\"\n\n'I just wanted out of that house'\n\nImage copyright Lucy Bates Image caption Lucy says her landlord would let herself into the house when no-one was there\n\nLast year the charity Citizens Advice found that tenants who complained about issues in their home were statistically more likely to get evicted.\n\nLucy Bates, 21, also had problems getting repairs done by her landlord after complaining of mould in her bedroom.\n\n\"The landlord said the mould was my fault and that I was going to have to clean it myself,\" she tells Newsbeat.\n\n\"She also said that if the mould damaged the paint, I'd have to pay for that.\"\n\nLucy's solicitor sent a letter to her landlord to try to get something done.\n\nBut the landlord refused to fix the issue and instead asked the tenants to move out four months before the end of their lease agreement.\n\n\"At that point it had created such a strain on my mental health that I didn't care, I just wanted out of that house,\" Lucy said.\n\n'Stop this sort of bullying'\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A section 21 can be used once an assured shorthold tenancy comes to an end\n\nDan Wilson Craw, director of Generation Rent, wants section 21s to be abolished so that tenants can feel secure when renting.\n\n\"Getting rid of section 21 would stop this sort of bullying and the practice of revenge evictions,\" he said.\n\n\"Another thing we want to see alongside that is limits on rent increases, because that's another tactic that landlords can use to intimidate tenants into not complaining.\n\n\"There are people who are putting up with really bad conditions because they are scared of an eviction notice or the rent going up.\"\n\nThe National Landlords Association says many local authorities lack the funds needed to help tenants.\n\nChris Norris, director of policy and practice, said: \"We all want a private rented sector rid of the kind of rogue operators who would rather evict someone than make a repair.\n\n\"Local authorities are responsible for enforcing against these landlords, however they often don't have the funding in place to effectively do so.\"\n\nHe also says some landlords rely on section 21s because it's harder to get their properties back through a section 8 possession notice.\n\nA section 8 means the renter has broken the terms of their tenancy - for example not paying rent - and sometimes involves landlords spending money taking action in court if the tenants refuse to leave.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here."

Cultured pig cells are being grown in her laboratory, which could one day lead to bacon raised entirely off the hoof.\n\nImage caption In the labs at Bath, the building blocks of artificial meat\n\nIn the future, you would take a biopsy from a pig, isolate stem (master) cells, grow more cells, then put them into a bioreactor to massively expand them, says postgraduate student Nick Shorten of Aberystwyth University.\n\n\"And the pig's still alive and happy and you get lots of bacon at the end.\"\n\nTo replicate the taste and texture of bacon will take years of research. For structure, the cells must be grown on a scaffold.\n\nSteps towards lab grown meat\n\n2013: First lab-grown burger , created by a team in the Netherlands at a cost of \u20ac250,000 - largely due to the time and labour needed to turn millions of tiny cells into meat\n\n, created by a team in the Netherlands at a cost of \u20ac250,000 - largely due to the time and labour needed to turn millions of tiny cells into meat December 2018: A \"steak\" grown from cells in the lab and not requiring the slaughter of a cow was produced in Israel. It cost $50 for a small thin strip, but, according to its makers, needs perfecting.\n\nAt Bath, they're experimenting with something that's entirely natural - grass. They're growing rodent cells, which are cheap and easy to use, on scaffolds of grass, as a proof of principle.\n\n\"The idea was to essentially, rather than feeding a cow grass and then us eating the meat - why don't we, in quotation marks, 'feed our cells grass',\" says Scott Allan, a postgraduate student in chemical engineering.\n\n\"We use it as a scaffold for them to grow on - and we then have an edible scaffold that can be incorporated into the final product.\"\n\nImage caption Dr Marianne Ellis is leading the project\n\nThe end product would be pure muscle tissue - basically, lean mince, rather than something with the taste and texture of a chop or steak, which means adding fat cells and connective cells to give it \"a bit more taste\".\n\nFor cultured meat to be available widely in the future, cells will need to be grown on a very large scale in a commercial facility.\n\n\"What we're doing here is looking to design bioreactors, and the bioprocess around the bioreactors, to grow muscle cells on a large scale that is economical and safe and high quality, so we can supply the muscle cells as cultured meats to as many people as want it,\" says Dr Ellis.\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption The world's first lab-grown burger was revealed in 2013 - at an eye-watering cost\n\nShe envisages taking \"primary cells\" from a living or recently slaughtered animal, or using a population of \"immortalised\" cells, that will keep on dividing. \"Which means that you don't kill any animals; you have this immortal cell that can be used forever.\"\n\nSlaughter-free meat is clearly a big selling point. Cultured meat might also be of interest to meat lovers who are concerned about the environmental problems that come with livestock production.\n\nRichard Parr is managing director for Europe of The Good Food Institute, a non-profit group that promotes alternatives to the products of conventional agriculture.\n\nHe says cell-based meat has the potential to use much less land and water, produce less carbon dioxide, spare billions of animals from immense pain and suffering, and help fight anti-microbial resistance and food contamination.\n\n\"It's also a massive commercial opportunity, which companies, universities and governments should seize the opportunity to support and invest in,\" he argues.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption You can reduce your carbon foodprint by cutting down on red meats such as beef and lamb.\n\nAccording to Marianne Ellis, most analysis seems to suggest a significant reduction in greenhouse gases, land use and water use for cultured meat, while the implications for energy use are less clear.\n\nOne recent study found lab-grown meat could actually be worse for the climate than conventional meat - although the research did not look at water and land use.\n\n\"Cultured meat might be one of these promising alternatives to reduce agricultural emissions but until we get more production data we can't automatically assume that for the time being,\" says the author of the paper, John Lynch of the University of Oxford.\n\nThe researchers at Bath see a future where cultured meat exists alongside traditional agriculture.\n\nIlltud Dunsford, co-founder with Marianne Ellis of the biotech start-up Cellular Agriculture, comes from a long line of farmers in Wales and is an advocate of traditional agriculture, but says there will be a need in the future to manage farmland for nature, with cattle playing a role, albeit in much smaller numbers.\n\n\"In my little farm in West Wales, ideally what I'd like to see is that we kept a range of very, very traditional native breeds of livestock on a very, very small scale to an exceptionally high welfare standard.\n\n\"The by-product from their use as a land management tool - whether that's in clearing land or restoring grasslands - would be the harvesting of cells for the culturing of cell-based meats.\"\n\nImage caption Illtud Dunsford is both a farmer and a biotech entrepreneur\n\nLab-grown meat is not expected to be available widely for at least five years. It remains to be seen whether people will want to eat it, but surveys in the UK suggest 20% would eat it, 40% wouldn't and the rest are undecided, with younger generations, urbanites and wealthier people more open to the idea.\n\nChris Bryant, a psychologist at the University of Bath, says the three major concerns are to do with price, taste, and naturalness and the related issue of safety.\n\nThe third is most difficult to address, he says, based on \"the naturalistic fallacy\", where people reason that natural things are good and unnatural things are bad.\n\nUltimately, then, it will be consumers who will be the judge of the success or failure of lab-grown meat.\n\nFollow Helen on Twitter."

Five tonnes of waste were produced for every tonne of usable clay that was mined. One such pile (not shown here), nicknamed the Great Treverbyn Tip, is a full 180m high.

    "text": "This story is featured in BBC Future\u2019s \u201cBest of 2018\u201d collection. Discover more of our picks.\n\n\n\nWe spend a third of our lives either sleeping\u2026 or trying to get to sleep. But in the world of 24/7 living and artificial light, our sleep is increasingly under threat.\n\nMany of us don\u2019t get the recommended seven to nine hours we need each night and struggle to get up in the mornings \u2013 especially on work days. But it isn\u2019t only our quantity of sleep that\u2019s affected. Since the discovery that light (particularly blue light, emanating from devices like smartphones) can affect our biological clocks, evidence has been building that exposure to even low levels of light in the evening or at the night is disrupting our sleep quality, as well.\n\nSo what would happen if we turned off the lights? Would it improve our sleep or have other benefits? And how easy would this be to achieve in a modern city?\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 How much sleep do we really need?\n\n\u2022 The vital time you shouldn\u2019t be on social media\n\n\u2022 Why you shouldn\u2019t try to be a morning person\n\nOne recent winter, I decided to find out. Working with sleep researchers Derk-Jan Dijk and Nayantara Santhi at the University of Surrey, I designed a programme to go cold-turkey on artificial light after dark, and to try to maximise exposure to natural light during the day \u2013 all while juggling an office job and busy family life in urban Bristol.\n\nThe discoveries I've made have revolutionised my attitude to light \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u2013 and how I live my life during the night and day. I now make simple, daily choices that can transform how I sleep, how I feel and perhaps even my cognitive abilities. Could you be doing the same?\n\nFor millennia, humans lived in synchrony with the natural cycle of light and dark. This doesn\u2019t mean that everyone went to sleep as soon as the Sun set. Studies of pre-industrial societies, such as tribes living in Tanzania or Bolivia today, suggest that people stay up for several hours after dark, often socialising by firelight. In fact, the amount of sleep they get is quite like people in industrialised countries, but the timing is more in line with the natural cycle of day and night: they tend to go to bed earlier and get up just before dawn.\n\n\u201cIn modern societies, at least on weekdays, we don\u2019t sleep in tune with our body clock,\u201d says Dijk. Exposure to artificial light at night is shifting our body clocks later. But we still need to go to work in the morning, so we set an alarm clock \u2013 even though the biological clock says we should still be asleep.\n\nPre-industrial societies such as the Hadza tribe in Tanzania also seem to have a far lower prevalence of sleep problems, like insomnia. \u201cWhen we asked members of the Hadza whether they thought their sleep was good, they almost universally said \u2018yes, it\u2019s totally fine\u2019. That statistically doesn't match up with what we see in the West,\u201d says David Samson, an anthropologist at the University of Toronto in Mississauga, who has studied them.\n\nLight has a powerful non-visual effect on our body and mind, something to remember when we stay indoors all day and have lights on late into the night \u2013 Nayantara Santhi\n\nWhy is this? Light enables us to see, but it affects many other body systems as well. Light in the morning advances our internal clock, making us more lark-like, while light at night delays the clock, making us more owlish. Light also suppresses a hormone called melatonin, which signals to the rest of the body that it\u2019s night-time \u2013 including the parts that regulate sleep. \u201cApart from vision, light has a powerful non-visual effect on our body and mind, something to remember when we stay indoors all day and have lights on late into the night,\u201d says Santhi, who previously demonstrated that the evening light in our homes suppresses melatonin and delays the timing of our sleep.\n\nHowever, light also boosts alertness in its own right. It\u2019s like drinking a double espresso. Although these stimulant effects are bad news if you\u2019re trying to sleep, being exposed to more bright light during the daytime could make us more alert. Light also stimulates brain regions that regulate mood.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is that we create a light exposure pattern with sufficient light during the day, and not too much light in the evening,\u201d says Dijk.\n\nDespite this logic, persuading my family to let me switch to this way of living took some effort. When I suggested to my husband that living by candlelight might be romantic, he rolled his eyes. But convincing him was a doddle compared to my six-year-old daughter and four-year-old son. Here\u2019s how that conversation went:\n\nMe: Children, we\u2019re going to try living in the dark for a few weeks\n\nDaughter: But that will be spooky.\n\nMe: No, I think it could be lots of fun. We\u2019ll have candles.\n\nDaughter: *bursts into tears*\n\nMe: Please don\u2019t cry. It will be like going camping.\n\nSon: Can we have marshmallows?\n\nSeveral packets of marshmallows later, we were set \u2013 although I agreed that my husband could occasionally use electric lighting and the kids could watch television, provided I wasn\u2019t nearby. Because I needed to maintain a normal work schedule, I also decided to keep the lights on until 18:00, although I switched my laptop to \u2018night mode\u2019 after sunset.\n\nThe protocol looked like this: during the first week, I would try to maximise my exposure to daylight by moving my desk next to the window, lingering in the park on the way back from school drop-off each morning, getting outside at lunchtime and trying to exercise outdoors. The second experimental week would be spent minimising my exposure to artificial light after 18:00, relying on candle-light or dim red lighting instead. Then I would combine the two.\n\nIn between each of these intervention weeks, I would lead a normal life. These weeks would function as a baseline.\n\nOn the last evening of each week, I would spend the evening in darkness, taking hourly samples of my melatonin, our 'hormone of darkness'\n\nTo track my responses, I\u2019d wear an \u2018actiwatch\u2019 to measure light exposure, activity and sleep. I'd also complete sleep diaries and questionnaires to assess my sleepiness and mood and undertake a battery of cognitive tests to assess my short-term memory, attention and reaction speeds. On the last evening of each week, I would spend the evening in darkness, taking hourly samples of my melatonin, which is released in response to a signal from the biological clock and therefore provides a marker of our internal time. \u201cMelatonin is our hormone of darkness; it creates the biological night,\u201d says Marijke Gordijn, a chronobiologist at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, who measured my melatonin levels.\n\nThe idea was to see if these changes to my light exposure altered the timing of my biological clock. We were curious to see if any of the benefits predicted by larger, well-controlled laboratory studies would translate into real life.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of experiments where we\u2019ve given a dose of light and seen that it shifts the clock,\u201d says Gordijn. \u201cBut if we want to apply those findings to help people, we need to know that it will have the same effect when the environment is more variable.\u201d\n\nSwitched on\n\nAnd so, on a bright and sunny December morning, I found myself in the local park, inconspicuously trying to work out on the monkey-bars and swings instead of going to a body pump session in the gym. \"Mummy, what's that lady doing?\" asked a small boy.\n\nBecause it was winter and most people were inside keeping warm, the park was largely deserted. Motivation had been a struggle for me also. It\u2019s hard to overcome the belief that because it\u2019s winter, it will be cold and miserable outside. However, I was reminded of something a Swedish friend used to say: there\u2019s no such thing as bad weather, only inappropriate clothing. And I soon realised that its rarely as bad outside as it may look. Indeed, the more I did it, the more I came to regard getting outdoors in winter as a treat, rather than a chore.\n\nOn another morning, I sat in the park with a cup of tea on my way back from dropping the kids at school and got out my light meter. The illuminance of light is measured in lux. On a cloudless day in summer, the light outdoors can reach as high as 100,000 lux; on an overcast day, it can be as low as 1,000 lux. Today, the reading was 73,000 lux.\n\nBack indoors, I took a reading in the centre of my shared office: 120 lux \u2013 lower even than the 500 lux you\u2019d expect outdoors immediately after sunset. Horrified, I returned to my temporary desk by the window, where it was colder, but a sunnier 720 lux.\n\nI took a reading in the centre of my shared office: 120 lux \u2013 lower even than the 500 lux you\u2019d expect outdoors after sunset\n\nDespite my best efforts to get more daylight during the intervention weeks, my average light exposure between 7:30 and 18:00 was 397 lux during the first week and just 180 lux during the second. This was presumably because I still spent most of the day indoors, working at my computer, and because the Sun set at around 16:00. The likely reason for this variation was the weather. During the first week, there were 4.5 hours of bright sunshine per day on average, whereas in the second week it was just 0.9 hours. This was still an improvement on baseline weeks, though, when my average daytime exposure was just 128 lux.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t only the weather that proved challenging. For the first few nights of the experiment, we slept with the curtains open to maximise exposure to the dawn light. Light at this time is thought to shift the body clock earlier.\n\nBut at night-time, the light from the streetlights made it difficult to sleep.\n\nUrban dwellers are exposed to night-time light levels three to six times brighter than people in small towns and rural areas\n\nI\u2019m not alone in experiencing this problem. In 2016, researchers reported that people living in urban areas of more than 500,000 people are exposed to night-time light levels that are three to six times brighter than people in small towns and rural areas. Those living in areas of more intense light sleep less, are more tired during the daytime, and report feeling more dissatisfied with their sleep. They also go to bed and wake up later than people in darker areas.\n\nAfter a few days of this, I began closing the curtains and using a dawn simulation clock instead. It was an imperfect solution, as the light from these devices isn\u2019t as bright as daylight. But it was better than nothing.\n\nIf exposing myself to more daylight wasn\u2019t hard enough, I also had to eliminate evening light during December, the darkest month of the year. Doing so brought home to me just how useful artificial light is. Cooking by candle-light was a daily challenge, chopping vegetables an outright hazard. I began to prepare meals earlier in the day, which ate into my work time and meant I got less done.\n\nEventually, I employed another work-around. I installed some smart lightbulbs in my kitchen, that could be dimmed and colour-adjusted using an app on my smartphone. This, of course, created a paradox: to remove the alerting blue light from the bulbs, I had to expose myself to blue light from my phone, so I did it in the daytime to avoid invalidating the experiment. Now our kitchen glowed an eerie red-orange by night. But at least we could cook again.\n\nDuring my \u2018dark weeks\u2019, I was exposed to an average illuminance of 0.5 lux between 18:00 and midnight and a maximum of 59 lux. That was compared to an average 26 lux (and a maximum of 9640 lux \u2013 I have no idea what this super-bright, artificial light source was) when I lived normally \u2013 although the actiwatch on my wrist wouldn\u2019t have detected any light emitting from my smartphone or laptop during baseline weeks. That\u2019s important, because there\u2019s mounting evidence to suggest that these devices can disrupt sleep.\n\nOne 2015 study suggested that using an e-reader before bed prolonged the amount of time it took for people to fall asleep, delayed the circadian clock, suppressed REM sleep, and left participants feeling more tired the next morning, compared to people who read a print book for the same amount of time.\n\nOne 2015 study suggested that using an e-reader before bed prolonged the amount of time it took for people to fall asleep, suppressed REM sleep, and left participants feeling more tired the next morning\n\nAnother recent study compared people\u2019s responses when they played computer games during the evening on a normal smartphone screen versus one that suppressed blue light. Players felt more alert after using the conventional smartphones and performed worse in cognitive tests the next day, suggesting that their sleep may have suffered.\n\nMy pledge to avoid artificial light also made socialising difficult. A few days before my experiment started, a friend invited us over to her house for pre-Christmas drinks in the middle of a \u201cdark week\u201d. When I explained my predicament, she generously offered to let me sit upstairs in a candle-lit room and receive visitors. I politely declined, feeling how I imagine vegans must feel when they\u2019re invited out to a meal at a steakhouse.\n\nInstead, we encouraged friends to come to our house, and so they came: amused, curious, and occasionally concerned about what they might find. One family initially declined our invitation to stay for New Year because they were worried their son might knock over the candles. They changed their mind when I told them they could use the lights in their bedroom. (We kept all candles out of kids\u2019 reach, just in case.)\n\nOnce we\u2019d adapted to the challenges, living without artificial light was very pleasant. Conversation seemed to flow more easily, and visitors also commented on how mellow and relaxed they felt in the dim light. Another bonus was that our children seemed to settle down more easily in the evenings, although we didn\u2019t collect any data on this.\n\nBut did any of this make any difference to my sleep or mental performance? There was a general trend towards earlier bedtimes during the intervention weeks \u2013 particularly during the week when increased daylight was combined with low evening light. On this week, my average bedtime was 23:00, compared to 23:35 on baseline weeks.\n\nAs it was December, I had a lot of social commitments, so I occasionally ignored my body\u2019s sleep signals and stayed up later. It\u2019s an issue that researchers often encounter in their studies. \u201cPeople have social obligations, and it\u2019s very hard for them to follow what their clock is telling them to do,\u201d says Mariana Figueiro, director of the Lighting Research Center in Troy, New York. \u201cWe are constantly fighting our physiology.\u201d\n\nI was significantly sleepier in the evenings during the increased daylight and low evening light weeks\n\nEven so, I was significantly sleepier in the evenings during the increased daylight and low evening light intervention weeks. My body also started releasing the darkness hormone, melatonin, some 1.5 hours earlier during the daylight intervention week \u2013 and two hours earlier when I avoided evening light.\n\nIt is a pattern that\u2019s been seen in other studies. Like me, Kenneth Wright at the University of Boulder in Colorado has long been fascinated by how our modern lighting environment might be affecting our internal timing. So in 2013, he sent eight people camping in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado for a week during the summer and measured how this affected their sleep. \u201cCamping is an obvious way of removing ourselves from this modern lighting environment and just getting access to natural light,\u201d says Wright.\n\nBefore the trip, the participants\u2019 average bedtime was 00:30 and their wake time 8:00. Both had shifted approximately 1.2 hours earlier by the end of the trip. They also started releasing melatonin some two hours earlier once they were removed from artificial light \u2013 although they didn\u2019t sleep for any longer.\n\nIn winter, people sent to camp outdoors for a week slept for around 2.3 hours longer than usual\n\nWright recently repeated the study in winter. This time, he found that participants went to sleep some 2.5 hours earlier under natural lighting conditions but woke up at roughly the same time as when they were living indoors. This meant they slept for around 2.3 hours longer. \u201cWe think it\u2019s because people were going back to their tents earlier to get warm, so they were giving themselves a longer opportunity to sleep,\u201d says Wright.\n\nUnlike his participants, I didn\u2019t experience a sizeable increase in the amount of sleep I got during the intervention weeks \u2013 although there was a slight increase in sleep time and efficiency (the ratio of the total time you spend asleep versus the amount of time bed). However, this didn\u2019t reach statistical significance, meaning it could have been the result of chance. Perhaps it was because I was living in a relatively warm house, which made defying my body clock easier. I also was forced to get up at the same time each morning by my children \u2013 who occasionally woke me at night, too.\n\nFor every 100 lux increase in my average daylight exposure, I experienced an increase in sleep efficiency of almost 1% and got an extra 10 minutes of sleep\n\nBut when I correlated my sleep with the amount of light I was exposed to during the daytime, an interesting pattern emerged. On the brightest days, I went to bed earlier. And for every 100 lux increase in my average daylight exposure, I experienced an increase in sleep efficiency of almost 1% and got an extra 10 minutes of sleep.\n\nI also felt more alert upon waking during all three intervention weeks \u2013 but particularly during the two weeks when I was exposed to more daylight.\n\nThis pattern has been seen in other studies too. The General Services Administration is the largest landlord in the United States. Many of the public buildings it manages either were designed to try and boost indoor daylight levels or have been remodelled, so its leaders were keen to find out if this had made any difference to the health of those working inside them. Working with the Lighting Research Center\u2019s Figueiro, they picked four such office buildings, plus the GSA Regional Office Building in Washington DC \u2013 a converted warehouse which had little access to natural daylight at that time. Workers were asked to wear a device that collected light data around their necks, as well as to complete daily mood and sleep questionnaires for a week during summer and again in winter.\n\nOur study revealed that if you are three, four, five feet from the window, you lose the daylight \u2013 Mariana Figueiro\n\nWhen the light data started to come in, it was initially disheartening. Despite efforts to boost daylight in the workplace, many GSA workers weren\u2019t receiving it. \u201cOur study revealed that if you are three, four, five feet from the window, you lose the daylight,\u201d Figueiro says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just your distance from the window that matters. You have partitions, people pulling the shades. Having a window doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re going to get good daylight.\u201d\n\nProbing further, Figueiro\u2019s team divided the office workers into those who were receiving a high circadian stimulus \u2013 light that was bright or blue enough to activate the circadian system \u2013 and those who were receiving a low stimulus.\n\nThose exposed to a high amount of morning light took an average of 18 minutes to fall asleep at night, compared to 45 minutes in the other group\n\nThose who received a high stimulus took less time to fall asleep at night and slept for longer. Morning light seemed to be particularly powerful: those exposed to a high stimulus between 8:00 and 12:00 took an average 18 minutes to fall asleep at night, compared to 45 minutes in the low stimulus group. They slept for an extra 20 minutes. Their sleep efficiency was 2.8% higher. And they reported significantly fewer sleep disturbances. These associations were stronger during winter, when people may have had less opportunity to receive natural light during their journey to work.\n\nGordijn also recently published a study which found that people slept better following more exposure to daylight. Here, the participants were wired up to polysomnography monitors to record their sleep in detail. \u201cPeople had more deep sleep, and it was less fragmented after more exposure to daylight,\u201d Gordijn says.\n\nLight heart\n\nUntil recently, scientists had assumed that our urge to sleep was driven by two independent systems: the circadian system, which affects sleep timing, and a \u2018homeostatic system\u2019 which keeps tabs on how long you\u2019ve been awake and ratchets up the pressure to sleep.\n\nLight was known to alter the timing of sleep via the circadian system. But recent work by Samer Hattar at the University of Maryland has suggested that the light-sensitive cells in the eye, which control the circadian system, also connect to the homeostatic system. \u201cWe propose that the timing and intensity of light exposure doesn\u2019t only modulate circadian-driven aspects of sleep, but also homeostatic sleep pressure,\u201d Gordijn says.\n\nDaylight also affects mood. Those GSA office workers who were exposed to brighter morning light scored lower on a self-rated scale of depression. Other research has shown that morning light, as well as light during the day, can improve symptoms of non-seasonal depression.\n\n\u201cIt probably has to do with being more entrained to the light/dark cycle and sleeping better,\u201d says Figueiro. In her study, those who recorded a high circadian stimulus in the daytime tended to be more active during daylight hours and less active once it got dark, suggesting their sleep was more aligned with their internal clock.\n\nThese data are in accordance with office studies in the UK. In March 2007, Dijk and his colleagues replaced the light bulbs on two floors of an office block in northern England, housing an electronic parts distribution company. Workers on one floor of the building were exposed to blue-enriched lighting for four weeks; those on the other floor were exposed to white light. Then the bulbs were switched, meaning both groups were ultimately exposed to both types of light. They found that exposure to the blue-enriched white light during daytime hours improved the workers\u2019 subjective alertness, performance, and evening fatigue. They also reported better quality and longer sleep.\n\nMy early-morning mood was significantly more positive during the intervention weeks compared to when I was living normally\n\nThis also fits with my own findings. Immediately after waking and before going to bed each night, I filled out a questionnaire to assess how positive and negative I was feeling. The results suggest that my early-morning mood was significantly more positive during the intervention weeks compared to when I was living normally. There was also a trend towards less negative feelings in the evening.\n\nAnd although I didn\u2019t officially assess my mood at any other time of day, I felt more energetic and uplifted on those weeks when I spent more time outside. Because of my experience, I\u2019m a convert to outdoor exercise. I\u2019m also learning to embrace the long winter nights: seeing the season as an opportunity to make the house cosy with candles rather than bemoaning the darkness.\n\nEven my daughter is a convert. Towards the end of the experiment, I asked her if she was looking forward to switching the lights back on. \"No,\" she said. \"It has been wonderful, because the candles are really relaxing.\" Instead, it was my four-year-old son who insisted: he wanted to see what he was eating at dinnertime.\n\nAlthough none of my cognitive test results achieved statistical significance, there was a trend towards faster reaction speeds during the intervention weeks, as well as slightly better performance in a test that involved remembering where a token was hidden in a series of boxes.\n\nStudies by Gilles Vanderwalle at the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium and Dijk have shown that exposure to bright light activates brain areas involved in alertness \u2013 although in these studies, the effects weren\u2019t long-lasting.\n\nHowever, in a separate study, researchers at Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin in Berlin discovered that the energising effects of light continued for the rest of the day. When participants were exposed to bright, blue-enriched light in the morning, they reported feeling less sleepy during the evenings, and their reaction speeds were maintained, rather than declining as time wore on. Also, the bright morning light seemed to buffer their body clocks against the effects of blue evening light \u2013 a finding which is in accordance with current mathematical models of how light affects the human biological clock and sleep.\n\nIt supports the idea that brighter and blue-enriched morning light could be a useful countermeasure to artificial light in the evenings especially during the darker seasons, when less daylight is available. It means we don't necessarily need to spend our evenings in darkness, or stop using our computers and gadgets.\n\nWhen we\u2019re talking about kids looking at iPads in the evening, it\u2019s having detrimental effects if they\u2019re spending their daytimes in biological darkness. But if they\u2019re in bright light during the day it may not matter. \u2013 Dieter Kunz\n\n\u201cThe effects of light in the evening highly depend on the light you were exposed to in the morning,\u201d says Dieter Kunz, who was involved in the study. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about kids looking at iPads in the evening, it\u2019s having detrimental effects if they\u2019re spending their daytimes in biological darkness. But if they\u2019re in bright light during the day it may not matter.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s ridiculously simple. But spending more time outdoors during the daytime and dimming the lights in the evening really could be a recipe for better sleep and health. For millennia, humans have lived in synchrony with the Sun. Perhaps it's time we got reacquainted.\n\nLinda Geddes is the author of the upcoming book Chasing the Sun: The astonishing science of sunlight and how to survive in a 24/7 world.

    "authors": [

      "Bbc Stories"
    ],
    "text": "When Stephanie Elderton's twin boys caught a cold, she never imagined that one of them would end up in intensive care. But the cold developed into bronchiolitis - and while bronchiolitis is usually a mild illness, in rare cases it becomes serious.\n\nReece and Luca are adorable twin boys.\n\nNow aged 14 months, they were born prematurely in 2017, arriving at 34 weeks. Reece weighed 4lb 7oz and Luca 4lb 2oz.\n\n\"They are identical boys but personality wise they are completely different,\" says Stephanie. \"They are very chatty, they're very lively. They love balls and any pop up toys and spinning toys. They like to laugh and they like to run.\n\n\"Well - Reece likes to run. Luca's a lot more serious, I would say, than Reece. He is quite happy to just be by himself and play by himself.\"\n\nDespite being premature, the twins did not require any special care. Soon after the birth they went home to join their older brother Jamie, who is now five.\n\nBut in January 2018, when the twins were five-and-a-half weeks old, Stephanie noticed that a cold they had both been suffering from was getting worse, so she asked her GP's surgery for advice.\n\n\"Luca stopped feeding as much and I mentioned this to the doctor, I mentioned this to the health visitor and they basically said, 'No, it's absolutely fine, they've just got a cold.'\n\n\"I said, 'OK, no problem, we'll just carry on as we are.' Then, when they were six weeks old, he wasn't waking, he wasn't eating, and so I took him back to the doctor's and I was like, 'There is something really wrong because this is just not how a baby should be.'\"\n\nStephanie also noticed changes in the way the twins were breathing - it was much faster than normal and more laboured.\n\nThe GP sent Stephanie straight to the local hospital, Hinchingbrooke in Cambridgeshire, where Luca was instantly put on a monitor to check the oxygen levels in his blood.\n\n\"They said he really wasn't very well and they put him straight into the high dependency unit (HDU) and then they looked at Reece and went, 'We think he's the same,'\" says Stephanie.\n\nThe HDU is a ward designed for people who need close observation, but not intensive care.\n\nThe hospital doctors told Stephanie the twins were suffering from bronchiolitis, a condition she had never heard of.\n\n\"Bronchiolitis is a viral chest infection and it's usually caused by the common viruses that cause colds in adults,\" says Dr Francis Gilchrist, a consultant in paediatric respiratory medicine and trustee of the British Lung Foundation.\n\nIt affects children under one year old, starting off with familiar cold symptoms. But with bronchiolitis the airways in the child's lungs become inflamed and swollen, causing them to narrow. In severe cases smaller tubes in the child's lungs - the bronchioles - clog up with mucus.\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, children recover at home within two to three weeks. But just occasionally severe cases occur - about 2-3% of all infants require hospitalisation, according to Francis Gilchrist.\n\nWhen to seek help\n\nParents should seek urgent medical help if they see these \"red flag\" signs:\n\nIncreased work when breathing - this may include making a grunting sound when the baby breathes out, flaring of the nostrils, sucking-in of the chest around the ribs or at the base of the throat\n\nNot having enough feeds - taking in less than half the usual amount for two or three feeds, or producing no wet nappies for 12 hours or more\n\nPersistent high temperature of 38C (101F) or above\n\nLong pauses in breathing\n\nTongue or lips are blue\n\nExhaustion, irritability, difficult to wake or floppy\n\nSource: NHS and NICE\n\nThe frustrating thing about bronchiolitis, he says, is that there is no effective treatment for the underlying condition.\n\n\"All the care that we do is supportive. So if necessary we give oxygen or support their breathing, or if they're really unwell they go on to have artificial ventilation in intensive care.\" Fortunately this is very rare - it only applies to 0.1%, or one in 1,000 children.\n\nIn the HDU, Luca was kept on observation for 24 hours but showed no signs of improvement.\n\n\"They did some X-rays to see what was going on and basically the whole of his left lung was completely blocked,\" says Stephanie.\n\nAt this point, the decision was taken to move him to Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge, where he could be ventilated. But then things suddenly got serious.\n\n\"When they tried to tube him, he basically stopped breathing altogether,\" says Stephanie. \"They had to give him CPR quite a few times and then they transferred us straight to Addenbrooke's hospital, to intensive care.\"\n\nThere the ventilator did the breathing for Luca to ensure more oxygen reached his tiny lungs. It was very hard for Stephanie to watch.\n\n\"He's just lying there, he's not awake because he's sedated and you can touch him, you can talk to him but he's not really him, you can't cuddle him or anything,\" she says.\n\nTo make things harder, Reece had remained in Hinchingbrooke hospital and she had to keep phoning the ward for updates.\n\n\"It was very tough and I didn't have my car either so I couldn't come back and forth so I just stayed at Addenbrooke's,\" says Stephanie. \"I had to kind of shut Reece out - 'Luca's the one that needs me now - Reece is fine, he's getting the help he needs' - and just kind of not think about it. Because otherwise that would have worn me down even more.\"\n\nFortunately, Stephanie's mother was able to spend time at Reece's bedside.\n\nBecause the boys were twins the medical team suspected they would both end up in the intensive care unit at Addenbrooke's, Stephanie says. But although Reece was very poorly, being fed via a nasal gastric tube, he stayed at Hinchingbrooke.\n\nMost cases of bronchiolitis are caused by Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), something that most children will have been exposed to by the time they are three. However it can also be caused by other viruses, such as rhinovirus, the most common cause of the common cold.\n\nWhy some children are affected more seriously than others, is still not fully understood, says Francis Gilchrist.\n\nFurther help and advice:\n\n\"There are certain risk factors that children have that mean they're more at risk of having severe bronchiolitis and that would be if they're very young, if they were born prematurely, if they have pre-existing disease, such as congenital heart disease, or if they have an underlying problem with their immune system.\n\n\"But there are some children who have none of those risk factors and end up with a severe episode, and we can't fully explain why.\"\n\nAfter five days in intensive care, the medical team tried to take Luca off the ventilator and transfer him to a different method of breathing support, known as Continuous Positive Air Pressure (CPAP), but Stephanie says Luca couldn't take it and had to be put back on the ventilator again.\n\n\"I was very disheartened by that, because after five days he hadn't got any better, we're kind of moving backwards not forwards,\" says Stephanie. \"It felt as if it was never going to end.\"\n\nDuring this time, Luca was having chest physiotherapy to try and loosen the mucus from his airways.\n\nFinally, after seven days, he was taken off the ventilator and began to improve. Stephanie says it felt very strange to cuddle him again for the first time.\n\n\"It was a bit like, 'Aww I don't remember how to do this,'\" she says.\n\nLuca was taken back to the children's ward at Hinchingbrooke. His twin, Reece, had been discharged the day before, but Luca had a visit from his older brother, Jamie, who had been staying with Stephanie's parents while the twins were in hospital.\n\n\"It was just amazing to see him, because it felt like I hadn't seen him for such a long time,\" says Stephanie.\n\nTwenty-four hours later Luca was discharged too and the family was finally reunited at home.\n\nTerrified the boys would catch another cold, Stephanie did not take them outside. But two weeks later she noticed they were breathing rapidly again - and this time they had spots. She called an ambulance and the twins ended up back at Hinchingbrooke.\n\nThere they were diagnosed with meningitis and put on intravenous antibiotics.\n\nThere is no association between bronchiolitis and bacterial meningitis, says Francis Gilchrist. It seems as though the boys were just unlucky.\n\nAfter another six days in hospital they were able to return home, but again Stephanie was afraid to take them out.\n\n\"Because they're twins, obviously twins seem to be quite unusual, everyone wants to look at them, everyone wants to touch them, all the old ladies want to kiss them. It's just madness. So I was like, 'Please don't touch them, they could get poorly.'\"\n\nA year later, she still worries about them getting colds.\n\n\"If my bigger one gets ill, I'm like, 'Don't touch them, wash your hands!'\" she says. \"I'm very frightened every time they cough or anything.\"\n\nIf they do get a cold, they tend to get very wheezy, Stephanie says, but they now have asthma inhalers and other medication to reduce airway inflammation.\n\nShe's noticed that many parents know as little about bronchiolitis as she did before her children became ill, and is keen to raise awareness about the illness - and in particular about the possibility of severe symptoms, even if they only occur in a small minority of cases.\n\n\"I don't know why it's not out there, because of how serious it can be,\" she says.\n\nShe says her hopes for the future are for her children to stay out of hospital and keep smiling.\n\nBut she knows the trauma of winter 2018 didn't just leave her when the children were discharged. \"It's going to be here forever,\" she says.\n\nAll photographs courtesy of Stephanie Elderton\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nMargot Noel has a condition called misophonia, which literally means \"hatred of sound\".

    "text": "It can be the smallest event that triggers Donna Penner\u2019s traumatic memories of an operation she had more than ten years ago.\n\nOne day, for instance, she was waiting in the car as her daughter ran an errand, and realised that she was trapped inside. What might once have been a frustrating inconvenience sent her into a panic attack.\n\n\u201cI started screaming. I was flailing my arms, I was crying,\u201d she says. \u201cIt just left me so shaken.\u201d Even the wrong clothing can make her anxiety worse.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 The surgeon giving his patients VR instead of sedatives\n\n\u2022 The quickest route to happiness is doing nothing\n\n\u2022 How meal times affect your waistline\n\n\u201cAnything that\u2019s tight around my neck is out of the question because it makes me feel like I\u2019m suffocating,\u201d says Penner, a 55-year-old from Altona in Manitoba, Canada.\n\nHer panic attacks began after a small medical procedure that she had before her 45th birthday. She was working in the accountancy department of a local trucking company and had just celebrated the wedding of one of her daughters. But she had been having severe bleeding and pain during her period, and her family physician had suggested that they investigate the causes with exploratory surgery.\n\nIt should have been a routine procedure, but, for reasons that are far from clear, the general anaesthetic failed. Rather than lying in peaceful oblivion, she woke up just before the surgeon made the first cut into her abdomen. With her body still paralysed by the anaesthetic drugs, she was unable to signal that anything was wrong.\n\nShe remained helpless on the operating table, in indescribable agony, as the surgeon probed her body. \u201cI thought, \u2018This is it, this is how I\u2019m going to die, right here on the table, and my family will never know what my last few hours were like because no one\u2019s even noticing what\u2019s going on.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe lingering trauma still causes her to have \u201ctwo or three nightmares each night\u201d. Having been put on medical leave from her job, Penner has lost her financial independence. She suspects that she will never fully escape the effects of that day more than a decade ago. \u201cIt\u2019s a life sentence.\u201d\n\nFor years, anaesthesia awareness has been shrouded in mystery. Although extreme experiences like Penner\u2019s are rare, there is now evidence that around 5% of people may wake up on the operating table \u2013 and possibly many more.\n\nIt is more probable than not that someone, somewhere in the world, right now is aware during their surgery - Peter Odor\n\nThanks to the amnesiac effects of the drugs, however, most of these people will be unable to remember anything about the event \u2013 and whether or not that is something we should be concerned about is both a practical and a philosophical question. It is all the more significant given just how often general anaesthesia is now used.\n\n\u201cAlmost three million general anaesthetics happen each year in the UK alone,\u201d says Peter Odor, a registrar at St George\u2019s Hospital in London. \u201cAs a consequence, it is more probable than not that someone, somewhere in the world, right now is aware during their surgery.\u201d\n\nWe once knew surprisingly little about why anaesthesia works. Now, however, researchers are striving to understand more about the nature of going under and the circumstances in which anaesthesia doesn\u2019t work, in the hope of making advances that might reduce the risk of anaesthesia awareness. And, with a greater understanding of the anaesthetised state, we may even be able to turn a rudimentary awareness to our advantage \u2013 in the form of medical hypnosis.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: anaesthesia is a medical miracle. Since at least the time of the Ancient Greeks, physicians and medicine men had hunted for a good way to ease the pain of medical procedures. While drugs such as alcohol, opium and even hemlock could act as sedatives, their efficacy was unreliable; most patients did not escape the torture.\n\nBy the 1840s, scientists had discovered various gases that appeared to have sedative effects. One of these, sulphuric ether, had attracted the particular attention of a dentist based in Boston who put it to the test in a public demonstration at the Massachusetts General Hospital in 1846. Although the patient was still able to mutter half-coherent thoughts, he reportedly felt no pain, just the faint sense of his skin being \u201cscratched with a hoe\u201d.\n\nThe news of the demonstration soon spread throughout the medical establishment, heralding the start of the anaesthetic era. With the subsequent discovery of even more effective anaesthetic agents such as chloroform, the agony of the surgical knife seemed to be a thing of the past.\n\nGeneral anaesthesia creates an unresponsive drug-induced coma that is deeper and more detached from reality than sleep\n\nGeneral anaesthesia creates a controlled unconsciousness that is deeper and more detached from reality even than sleep. Today, anaesthetists have a wide range of pain-killing and consciousness-reducing drugs at their disposal, and the exact choice will depend on the procedure and the patient\u2019s particular needs.\n\nOften, the aim is not to produce a loss of consciousness but simply to remove the sensation from a particular part of the body. So-called \u201cregional anaesthetics\u201d include spinal and epidural anaesthetics, both of which are delivered between the bones of your back to numb the lower half of your body. These are commonly used during childbirth, bladder operations and hip replacements.\n\nYou may also be given a sedative, which produces a relaxed, sleepy state. However, it does not fully eliminate your awareness.\n\nGeneral anaesthesia, in contrast, aims to do just that, creating an unresponsive drug-induced coma or controlled unconsciousness that is deeper and more detached from reality even than sleep, with no memories of any events during that period. As Robert Sanders, an anaesthetist at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, puts it: \u201cWe\u2019ve apparently ablated this period of time from that person\u2019s experience.\u201d (During the operation, the patient may also be given painkillers to ease their recovery when they wake up from surgery.)\n\nWe still don\u2019t know exactly why anaesthetic agents dim our consciousness, but they are thought to interfere with various brain chemicals called neurotransmitters. These chemicals turn up or turn down the activity of neurons, particularly the widespread communication between different brain regions.\n\nPropofol, for instance \u2013 a milky-white fluid used in general anaesthetics and some types of sedation \u2013 seems to amplify the effects of GABA, an inhibitor that damps down activity in certain areas of the brain, as well as communication between them.\n\nSanders\u2019s colleagues recently used a form of non-invasive brain stimulation to demonstrate this principle in action, with propofol silencing the waves of activity you would normally see spreading across the brain in response to the stimulation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very possible that anaesthesia interferes with that ascending transmission of information,\u201d he says. And without it, the mind temporarily disintegrates, becoming a blank screen with no ability to process or respond to the body\u2019s signals.\n\nIn the clinic, there are many complicating factors to consider, of course. An anaesthetist may choose to use one drug to induce the temporary coma and another to maintain it, and they need to consider many factors \u2013 such as the patient\u2019s age and weight, whether they smoke or take drugs, the nature of their illness \u2013 to determine the doses.\n\nMany procedures also use muscle relaxants. For example, nearly half of general anaesthetics administered in the UK included neuromuscular blockers. These drugs temporarily paralyse the body, preventing spasms and reflexes that could interfere with the surgery.\n\nThis all makes anaesthesia as much art as science, and in the vast majority of cases, it works astonishingly well\n\nNeuromuscular blockers can also ease the insertion of a tube through the windpipe, which can be used to ensure the airway remains open as well as to deliver oxygen and drugs, and to prevent stomach acid from entering the lungs. If the paralytic agents also stop muscles in the diaphragm and abdomen from moving, however, the patient\u2019s breathing must be assisted artificially with a ventilator.\n\nThis all makes anaesthesia as much art as science, and in the vast majority of cases, it works astonishingly well. More than 170 years after its first public demonstration, anaesthetists across the world plunge millions of people each year into comas and then bring them out safely. This doesn\u2019t just reduce patients\u2019 immediate suffering; many of the most invasive lifesaving procedures would simply not be possible without good general anaesthesia.\n\nBut as with any medical procedure, there can be complicating factors. Some people may have a naturally higher threshold for anaesthesia, meaning that the drugs don\u2019t reduce the brain\u2019s activity enough to dim the light of consciousness.\n\nIn some cases, such as injuries involving heavy bleeding, an anaesthetist may be forced to use a lower dose of the anaesthetic for the patient\u2019s own safety.\n\nIt may also be difficult to time the effects of the different drugs, to ensure that the so-called induction dose (which gets you to sleep) doesn\u2019t fade before the maintenance dose (to keep you unconscious) kicks in.\n\nIn some situations, you might be able to raise or lower your limb, or even speak, to show the anaesthetic is not working before the surgeon picks up their scalpel. But if you have also been given neuromuscular blockers, that won\u2019t be possible. The unfortunate result is that a small proportion of people may lie awake for part or all of their surgery without any ability to signal their distress.\n\nPenner talks about her own experience, during a lengthy telephone conversation from her home in Canada.\n\nShe says that she had felt anxious in the run-up to the operation, but she had had general anaesthetic before without any serious problems. She was wheeled into the operating theatre, placed on the operating table, and received the first dose of anaesthesia. She soon drifted off to sleep, thinking, \u201cHere I go.\u201d\n\nWhen she woke up, she could hear the nurses buzzing around the table, and she felt someone scrubbing at her abdomen \u2013 but she assumed that the operation was over and they were just clearing up. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018Oh boy, you were anxious for no reason.\u2019\u201d It was only once she heard the surgeon asking the nurse for a scalpel that the truth suddenly dawned on her: the operation wasn\u2019t over. It hadn\u2019t even begun.\n\nThe next thing she knew, she felt the blade of his knife against her belly as he made his first incision, leading to excruciating pain.\n\nShe tried to sit up and to speak \u2013 but thanks to a neuromuscular blocker, her body was paralysed. \u201cI felt so\u2026 so powerless. There was just nothing I could do. I couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t scream, couldn\u2019t open my eyes,\u201d she says. \u201cI tried to cry just to get tears rolling down my cheeks, thinking that they would notice that and notice that something was going on. But I couldn\u2019t make tears.\u201d\n\nThe frustration was immense. \u201cIt felt like someone was sitting on me and holding me down and there was absolutely nothing I could do.\u201d\n\nEventually, she tried to focus all her attention on moving one foot, which she managed to wiggle very slightly \u2013 and felt astonishing relief when one of the nurses placed his hand over it. Before she could move it again, however, the nurse had let go. She tried a total of three times, all with the same result. \u201cIt was very frustrating for me knowing that was the only way to communicate and it wasn\u2019t working.\u201d\n\nI felt so\u2026 so powerless. There was just nothing I could do. I couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t scream, couldn\u2019t open my eyes - Donna Penner\n\nPenner\u2019s torment should have finished after the surgeon had ended his work. But as the neuromuscular blockers began to wear off, she started to move her tongue around the tube stuck down her throat; it was a way, she thought, of signalling to the staff that she was awake.\n\nUnfortunately, the staff misread her attempts at communication, and began to withdraw the tube prematurely, before the paralytic agent had faded enough for her lungs to be able to operate on their own. \u201cSo here I was lying on the table and he took away my life support, my oxygen, I could not take a breath,\u201d Penner says. She assumed she would die.\n\nAt this point, the operating room began to feel more distant, as she felt her mind escape in an out-of-body experience. A committed Christian, she says she felt the presence of God with her. It was only after the staff restored her oxygen supply that she drifted back into the operating room, to wake, crying.\n\nThat pain, the fear, the sense of absolute helplessness, all still linger to this day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to sit at home here and watch all the neighbours hurrying out of their house in the morning, jump in their cars, and go off to work, and I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nVarious projects around the world have attempted to document experiences like Penner\u2019s, but the Anesthesia Awareness Registry at the University of Washington, Seattle, offers some of the most detailed analyses. Founded in 2007, it has now collected more than 340 reports \u2013 most from North America \u2013 and although these reports are confidential, some details have been published, and they make illuminating reading.\n\nNearly all the patients included said they heard voices or other sounds under general anaesthesia (patients\u2019 eyes are typically closed during surgery so visual experiences tend to be less common).\n\n\u201cI heard the type of music and tried to figure why my surgeon chose that,\u201d one patient told the registry.\n\n\u201cI heard several voices around me,\u201d another reported. \u201cThey seemed to be panicking. I heard them say they were losing me.\u201d\n\nAs you might expect, a large majority of the accounts \u2013 more than 70% \u2013 also contain reports of pain. \u201cI felt the sting and burning sensation of four incisions being made, like a sharp knife cutting a finger,\u201d wrote one. \u201cThen searing, unbearable pain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were two parts I remember quite clearly,\u201d wrote a patent who had had a wide hole made in his femur. \u201cI heard the drill, felt the pain, and felt the vibration all the way up to my hip. The next part was the movement of my leg and the pounding of the \u2018nail\u2019.\u201d The pain, he said, was \u201cunlike anything I thought possible\u201d.\n\nIt is the paralysing effects of the muscle blockers that many find most distressing, however. For one thing, it produces the sensation that you are not breathing \u2013 which one patient described as \u201ctoo horrible to endure\u201d.\n\nThen there\u2019s the helplessness. Another patient noted: \u201cI was screaming in my head things like \u2018don\u2019t they know I\u2019m awake, open your eyes to signal them\u2019.\u201d\n\nTo make matters worse, all of this panic can be compounded by a lack of understanding of why they are awake but unable to move.\n\n\u201cThey have no reference point to say why is this happening,\u201d says Christopher Kent at the University of Washington, who co-authored the paper about these accounts. The result, he says, is that many patients come to fear that they are dying. \u201cThose are the worst of the anaesthesia experiences.\u201d\n\nEstimates of how often anaesthesia awareness happens have varied depending on the methods used, but those relying on patient reports had tended to suggest it was very rare indeed.\n\nOne of the largest and most thorough investigations was the fifth National Audit Project carried out by British and Irish anaesthetists\u2019 associations, in which every public hospital in the UK and Ireland had to report any incidents of awareness for a year. The results, published in 2014, found that the overall prevalence was just 1 in 19,000 patients undergoing anaesthesia. The figure was higher \u2013 around 1 in 8,000 \u2013 if the anaesthesia included paralysing drugs, which is to be expected, since they prevent the patient from alerting the anaesthetist that there is a problem before it is too late.\n\nMany more people might be conscious during surgery, but they simply can\u2019t remember it afterwards\n\nThese low numbers were comforting news. As the media reported at the time, you were more likely to die during surgery than to become aware during the operation, confirming many doctors\u2019 suspicions that this was a very remote risk.\n\nUnfortunately, these figures are probably underestimates, as Odor explains to me at St George\u2019s Hospital in London. For one thing, the National Audit Project relied on patients themselves reporting directly to the hospital \u2013 but many people may feel unable or unwilling to come forward, and would instead prefer to just put the experience behind them\n\nThere are also the amnesiac effects of the drugs themselves. \u201cAnaesthetic drugs disrupt your ability to encode a memory,\u201d said Odor. \u201cAnd the dose that you give to obliterate memories is lower than that you need to obliterate consciousness. So memory goes well before consciousness goes.\u201d\n\nThis suggests many more people might be conscious during surgery, but they simply can\u2019t remember it afterwards.\n\nTo investigate this phenomenon, researchers are using what they call the isolated forearm technique. During the induction of the anaesthesia, the staff place a cuff around the patient\u2019s upper arm that delays the passage of the neuromuscular agent through the arm. This means that, for a brief period, the patient is still able to move their hand. So, a member of staff could ask them to squeeze their hand in response to two questions: whether they were still aware, and, if so, whether they felt any pain.\n\nIn the largest study of this kind to date, Robert Sanders at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison recently collaborated with colleagues at six hospitals in the US, Europe and New Zealand. Of the 260 patients studied, 4.6% responded to the experimenters\u2019 first question, about awareness.\n\nThat is hundreds of times greater than the rate of remembered awareness events that had been noted in the National Audit Project. And around four in 10 of those patients who did respond with the hand squeeze \u2013 1.9% across the whole group \u2013 also reported feeling pain in the experimenters\u2019 second question.\n\nEthical quandaries\n\nThese results raise some ethical quandaries. \u201cWhenever I talk to the trainees I talk about the philosophical element to this,\u201d says Sanders. \u201cIf the patient doesn\u2019t remember, is it concerning?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that the patients who fail to remember the experience later go on to develop PTSD or other psychological issues\n\nSanders says that there\u2019s no evidence that the patients who respond during the isolated forearm experiments, but fail to remember the experience later, do go on to develop PTSD or other psychological issues like Donna Penner. And without those long-term consequences, you might conclude that the momentary awareness is unfortunate, but unalarming.\n\nYet the study does make him uneasy, and so he conducted a survey to gather the public\u2019s views on the matter. Opinions were mixed. \u201cMost people didn\u2019t think that amnesia alone is sufficient \u2013 but a surprisingly large minority thought that as long as you didn\u2019t remember the event, it\u2019s OK,\u201d Sanders says.\n\n\u201cMy view is that the patient is expecting to be unconscious, and, as a researcher who wants to understand the mechanisms at play, but also a clinician who wants to deliver high-quality care and meet the expectations of the patient, we are duty-bound to understand this balance and to find out the true rates and the true impact of those events, whether they have any impact or not, and the ways we can curtail them.\u201d\n\nGiven that the vast majority of patients will emerge from general anaesthesia without traumatic memories, there is the danger that reports of anaesthesia awareness \u2013 including this one \u2013 will needlessly increase anxiety before operations.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, those fears could even prevent someone from having an essential medical procedure. Certainly, anaesthetists such as Sanders have emphasised that the risks of explicit recall are small, but if you are anxious you should talk to the hospital staff about your concerns.\n\nBut there are, nevertheless, strong arguments for making this phenomenon more widely known. For instance, as the reports from the University of Washington\u2019s registry show, some patients\u2019 distress was amplified by their lack of understanding of what was happening. They assumed that their awareness was a sign that they were dying. Perhaps if they had known the risk beforehand, that panic might have been assuaged.\n\nA better understanding of anaesthesia awareness might also help medical staff to deal with patients who have experienced this trauma. Many \u2013 including Penner \u2013 have felt that their accounts were misunderstood or simply dismissed by medical professionals.\n\nThere is the danger that reports of anaesthesia awareness \u2013 including this one \u2013 will needlessly increase anxiety before operations\n\nThe Washington registry, for instance, found that 75% of those who had reported awareness were unsatisfied with the response from medical staff, with 51% saying that neither the anaesthetist nor the surgeon expressed sympathy for their experience. Overall, just 10% received an apology, and only 15% were referred for counselling to help them to deal with the trauma.\n\nPenner says that many of the staff at her hospital seemed completely bewildered by her trauma. As she came around, she tried to explain to the nurses what had happened to her, but they just stood in silence, she says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget their expressions \u2013 it was like they were in shock.\u201d She puts this down to a lack of education and understanding of the phenomenon. \u201cThey don\u2019t know how to handle this kind of a situation.\u201d\n\nHaving gained strength in the years following the trauma, Penner is now trying to remedy the problem. She is working with Canadian universities to educate doctors about the risks of anaesthesia awareness and the best ways to treat patients. \u201cI want them to be prepared, because when things go wrong you need to know how you are going to react to the patient, because that is crucial to the patient\u2019s recovery process.\u201d\n\nThe ultimate goal, though, is to prevent these traumatic experiences from occurring in the first place, with studies using the isolated forearm technique helping to identify the best procedures to ensure unconsciousness. \u201cThere could be specific combinations of drugs that could produce the right blend of anaesthesia to insulate people from the external sensory world a bit better,\u201d Sanders says.\n\nThere is even a chance that, as our understanding of the anaesthetised state deepens, we might be able to turn rudimentary unconscious responsiveness during surgery to our advantage. Certain forms of medical hypnosis have been found to have a real effect on patients\u2019 experiences in controlled clinical trials \u2013 and the anaesthetic state could be the perfect time to put it into practice.\n\nAlthough widespread signalling across the brain appears to be impaired when people are under general anaesthesia, there is evidence that certain areas \u2013 including the auditory cortex \u2013 remain responsive, suggesting that medical staff might be able to send suggestions and encouragement, while a patient is unconscious, to reduce their pain after surgery.\n\nStudies investigating this possibility are few, but Jenny Rosendahl, at Jena University Hospital in Germany, and her colleagues have attempted to gather all the evidence to date. Their meta-analysis showed a small but significant improvement in the patients\u2019 ratings of post-operative nausea and vomiting, and less use of morphine after the operation.\n\nClearly, no one is suggesting that you would keep a patient fully aware on purpose, but perhaps one day more anaesthetists will be able to make use of the brain\u2019s ability to absorb information on the operating table. It is an exciting thought that the words we hear during this mysterious twilight zone could have a lasting effect on our recovery.\n\n--\n\nDavid Robson is d_a_robson on Twitter.\n\nThis article was first published on Mosaic by Wellcome and is republished here under a Creative Commons licence.\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

      "Ella Buchan"
    ],
    "text": "\u201cWe\u2019re a Victorian institution,\u201d black-cab driver Henry announced proudly, tugging on his tartan cap. It was a grey mid-morning in London and I was squeezed in a small green shed behind a narrow, U-shaped table. Surrounding me were a cluster of taxi drivers who slurped on mugs of tea and shovelled in forkfuls of scrambled egg and sausage.\n\nThis diminutive shed in Russell Square is where the keepers of London\u2019s secrets gather \u2013 the black-cab drivers whose minds are mapped with every inch of the city. It\u2019s one of 13 cabmen\u2019s shelters remaining in the capital, and only licensed drivers who have passed The Knowledge test \u2013 memorising every street, landmark and route in London \u2013 are allowed inside.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 A strange London life that few know\n\n\u2022 London\u2019s secret underground mail rail\n\n\u2022 The bread that changed how the Irish eat breakfast\n\nThe idea for the shelters came in the late 19th Century when George Armstrong, a year before he became editor of The Globe newspaper, was unable to hail a taxi during a blizzard because the drivers, who then rode horse-drawn hansom cabs, were huddled in a nearby pub. He teamed up with philanthropists, including the Earl of Shaftesbury, to find a way to keep drivers on the straight and narrow \u2013 and off the drink.\n\nThe Cabmen\u2019s Shelter Fund was born in 1875, building the first hut in St John\u2019s Wood. It still operates today, though many of the further 60 huts built have since been knocked down.\n\nThis is where the keepers of London\u2019s secrets gather\n\nEach hut was built no bigger than a horse and cart, in line with Metropolitan Police rules because they stood on public highways. They provided shelter and sustenance for hackney-carriage (black-cab) drivers, with strict rules against swearing, gaming, gambling and drinking alcohol.\n\nThen came World War I. Drivers and their vehicles were drafted, plunging the cab trade \u2013 and the shelters \u2013 into decline. \u201cWe lost people, cars and horses,\u201d said Gary, one of the cabbies I chatted to at Russell Square.\n\nUnused, unloved and unprotected, the oak huts suffered rot and ruin. Some were destroyed by bombs during World War II, while many were later bulldozed in street-widening schemes.\n\nNow just 13 remain, with 10 in operation. Each is Grade II listed, which means they are considered buildings of special interest and every effort should be made to preserve them. They are owned by the Worshipful Company of Hackney Carriage Drivers (WCHCD), a guild for those who earn their living through the trade. The Cabmen\u2019s Shelter Fund is responsible for upkeep and maintenance, issuing annual licences to those who run them.\n\n\u201cThe cab trade is very lonely,\u201d said Colin Evans, a cabbie of 44 years and trustee of the fund. \u201cThese are places where you can go and have a tea or coffee with your mates. If drivers don\u2019t support them, they will be lost forever.\u201d\n\nGary, who often comes here for a tea and a grumble because \u201ceveryone\u2019s in the same boat\u201d, added: \u201cI\u2019ve been driving a cab for more than a few years and only recently started using the shelters. I decided, use them or lose them.\u201d\n\nMost serve breakfast (sausages, eggs, bacon), sandwiches and hot drinks, with the occasional pie or lasagne cooked by the owners at home and reheated in the skinny kitchens. Non-cabbies aren\u2019t allowed to sit inside \u2013 unless issued with a rare invitation \u2013 but can order through a window hatch.\n\n\u201cWe bring in more money that way,\u201d said Jude Holmes, who runs the kitchen at Russell Square. \u201cI can serve hundreds of people while a driver sits with one cup of tea.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s like their second home\n\nAs we sat there, a relentless drizzle outside drew more cabbies through the door, each greeting the others like family members.\n\n\u201cMy little gang comes in every day,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cI worry a bit if I don\u2019t see them. It\u2019s like their second home. Sometimes they even make their own tea.\u201d She added that newer drivers are often too intimidated to come inside, preferring to order bacon sandwiches at the window.\n\n\u201cIt can feel a bit cliquey at times,\u201d Gary admitted.\n\nThe kettle bubbled, teaspoons clinked against china, and bacon spluttered and sizzled in a pan as talk turned to the cabbies\u2019 biggest bugbears. Being \u2018bilked\u2019, for example, when a fare runs off without paying. Struggling to find a public lavatory when on the job is another common groan (the shelters don\u2019t have loos).\n\nMost drivers have other gigs, as musicians, artists, TV producers, even actors. But, they told me, once a cabbie \u2013 always a cabbie. \u201cIf you retire, you die,\u201d Gary deadpanned.\n\nThe anecdotes poured faster than the tea. There\u2019s the tale of \u2018Fat Ray\u2019, so huge he squeezes himself behind the wheel each morning and doesn\u2019t budge until he gets home. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t come in \u2019ere,\u201d said Henry, sweeping his hand around the shelter. \u201cHe\u2019d never fit through the door!\u201d\n\nEvans took me for a spin in his cab, stopping by Temple Place shelter on Victoria Embankment, where a team was fixing damage caused by a lorry.\n\nThe shelters\u2019 Grade II status means restoration is intricate and expensive. Refurbishment costs around \u00a330,000, Evans estimated, and replacement materials must match the originals. Even the shade of paint \u2013 Dulux Buckingham Paradise 1 Green \u2013 is prescribed to mirror the first huts.\n\nThey represent a moment in time\n\nShelters have also been hit by noise restrictions in residential areas, and none currently operate at night \u2013 most open around 07:00 and close by 13:00. A hut at Chelsea Embankment has been closed for five years due to parking restrictions, and the fund is considering donating it to the London Transport Museum.\n\nCrucially, said Evans, these tiny huts must not disappear \u2013 nor should their history be forgotten. \u201cIt\u2019s too easy to get rid of these things. The shelters are unique. They represent a moment in time.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true there\u2019s plenty of history packed within their walls. Evans told me that the Gloucester Road shelter was nicknamed \u2018The Kremlin\u2019 because it was frequented by left-wing drivers. The since-bulldozed Piccadilly hut was the site of Champagne-fuelled parties in the 1920s and dubbed the \u2018Junior Turf Club\u2019 \u2013 after an exclusive gentlemen\u2019s club nearby \u2013 by (non cab-driver) aristocratic revellers who smuggled in booze.\n\nAnd according to local legend, a man claiming to be Jack the Ripper once visited Westbourne Grove shelter.\n\nPhysical signs of their history remain. Tenders attached to the bottom of the huts were where drivers tethered their horses before going inside. The animals drank from marble troughs, now gone. Each shelter still has a rooftop vent with ornate carvings \u2013 reminders of the wood-burning stoves once used for heating and cooking.\n\nWe continued onto Warwick Avenue shelter, frequented by musicians and actors who live nearby. British mod-rocker Paul Weller, former lead singer of The Jam and The Style Council, often comes to the hatch for a sausage-and-egg sandwich, licensee Tracy Tucker told me.\n\nTucker, whose husband is a cabbie, has been a shelter keeper for 14 years, moving to this location from Thurloe Place in 2016. The roof was recently re-shingled at a cost of \u00a313,000, financed by the fund.\n\nInside, the tiny kitchen has a stovetop sizzling with sausages and bacon, a fridge stocked with sandwich fillings and shelves heaving with cabbies\u2019 mugs bearing the crests of their football teams. When someone\u2019s team is relegated or loses a big match, Tucker ties a black ribbon to their mug\u2019s handle in commiseration.\n\nTo her regulars, Tucker is family.\n\n\u201cThey see me as a big sister,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I\u2019m sick, I have to text about 20 people to say the shelter is closed. Some of them won\u2019t know what to do with themselves.\u201d\n\nIf we lose this, we lose part of London history\n\nShe has her own rules: no staring at mobile phones and no moaning about Uber. \u201cWe all know it\u2019s quiet. The trade is dying, and I have thought about what I would do if I had to get another job. I don\u2019t think I could work anywhere else.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe little lives that go on in these shelters,\u201d chuckled Evans as we pulled away. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the buildings. It\u2019s the characters, too. If we lose this, we lose part of the cab trade\u2019s history and a part of London history. That would be a real shame.\u201d\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

    "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Would you be happy being interviewed by a robot?\n\nThe world's first robot designed to carry out unbiased job interviews is being tested by Swedish recruiters. But can it really do a better job than humans?\n\nHer name is Tengai. Measuring 41cm (16in) tall and weighing 3.5kg (7.7lbs) she's at eye level as she sits on top of a table directly across from the candidate she's about to interview.\n\nHer glowing yellow face tilts slightly to the side. Then she blinks and smiles lightly as she poses her first question: \"Have you ever been interviewed by a robot before?\"\n\nTengai is the brainchild of Furhat Robotics, an artificial intelligence (AI) and social robotics company born out of a research project at Stockholm's KTH Royal Institute of Technology.\n\nThe firm has spent the past four years building a human-like computer interface that mimics the way we speak, as well as our subtle facial expressions. The idea, according to chief scientist Gabriel Skantze, is that \"it feels much less scary or strange compared to a more traditional robot\".\n\nSince October 2018, the start-up's been collaborating with one of Sweden's largest recruitment firms, TNG. The goal is to offer candidates job interviews that are free from any of the unconscious biases that managers and recruiters can often bring to the hiring process, while still making the experience \"seem human\".\n\nImage caption Elin \u00d6berg M\u00e5rtenzon from recruitment agency TNG hopes Tengai will standardise interviews\n\n\"It typically takes about seven seconds for someone to make a first impression and about five to 15 minutes for a recruiter to make a decision. We want to challenge that,\" explains Elin \u00d6berg M\u00e5rtenzon, chief innovation officer at TNG's office in central Stockholm.\n\nUnconscious biases include making assumptions about someone's competence based on gender, ethnicity, voice, education, appearance, or as a result of informal conversations before or after an interview.\n\n\"For example, if I ask you a question at the beginning of the process like: 'Do you play golf?' and you say: 'Yes I do, I love playing golf', and I do too, then in some way I will put that in a positive box,\" says Ms M\u00e5rtenzon.\n\nTengai, by contrast, doesn't engage in pre-interview chit-chat and poses all questions in an identical way, in the same tone, and typically, in the same order. This is thought to create a fairer and more objective interview.\n\nRecruiters or managers are then given text transcripts of each interview to help them decide which candidates should move to the next stage of the process, based on the answers alone.\n\nImage caption Recruiter Petra Elisson has been putting Tengai through her paces\n\n\"I think it is a really good help while screening - if you have a big recruitment process with a lot of candidates - having someone, a robot, with no emotions, no feelings,\" says Petra Elisson, a 50-year-old who works in healthcare recruitment.\n\nShe has been taking part in the trials, both as a recruiter analysing candidates transcripts and as an interviewee.\n\n\"I was quite sceptical at first before meeting Tengai, but after the meeting I was absolutely struck,\" she reflects.\n\n\"At first I really, really felt it was a robot, but when going more deeply into the interview I totally forgot that she's not human.\"\n\nBut robots are programmed by humans, analyse datasets compiled by humans, and learn from human behaviour, so couldn't they inherit some of our biases?\n\nFurhat Robotics says it has sought to stop this by carrying out multiple test interviews using a diverse pool of volunteers.\n\n\"It's learning from several different recruiters so it doesn't pick up the specific behaviour of one recruiter,\" explains the start-up's chief scientist, Gabriel Skantze.\n\nImage caption Furhat Robotics' Gabriel Skantze says Tengai is trained to avoid human biases\n\nFollowing several months of trials, Tengai will start interviewing candidates for real later in May. Recruiters and developers are also working on an English-language version of the robot which is expected to be rolled out by early 2020.\n\nThe goal is that she will eventually be sophisticated enough to decide for herself whether a candidate can move forward to the next stage of recruitment, avoiding the need for a human to review interview transcripts.\n\n\"Before we completely rely on that, we have to make sure that there is no bias in our data,\" explains Mr Skantze.\n\nSweden does offer an especially interesting test bed for AI recruitment.\n\nAs well as being a small country with a reputation for early adoption when it comes to new technologies, ethnic diversity in the labour market is a particularly hot topic following record immigration in recent years.\n\nUnemployment among native Swedes is around 4%, but for citizens born abroad the figure is more than 15%. Compare that to the UK, where 5% of foreign-born citizens are without a job.\n\nImage caption Bulgarian job seeker Ekaterina would welcome bias-free interview robots\n\nA recent survey for TNG suggested that 73% of job seekers in Sweden believe they have been discriminated against while applying for a job on the basis of their ethnicity, age, gender, sexual preferences, appearance, weight, health or disability.\n\n\"Swedish culture is very risk-averse, so normally they like the safe card... the Swedish person,\" says one Bulgarian job seeker who wants to be known only by her first name, Ekaterina, waiting outside a city centre employment agency.\n\nEkaterina believes robots such as Tengai could be \"great as a first step\" in the recruitment process, because they \"don't have any stereotypes about your dialect or accent or where you come from\".\n\nThe technology has also been championed by Diversity Foundation, a non-political, non-profit organisation that campaigns for more inclusion in the Swedish labour market.\n\n\"Any method that emphasises competency and skills over things like ethnicity is a welcome development and truly part of the Swedish innovation spirit,\" says chief operating officer Matt Kriteman.\n\nMore Technology of Business\n\nA growing number of AI tools and technologies are being tested around the world in the field of recruitment.\n\nAmong the most high-profile is HireVue, a US-based video platform that enables candidates to be interviewed at any time of day and uses algorithms to evaluate their answers and facial expressions.\n\nSeedlink, which has offices in Amsterdam and Shanghai, asks candidates to answer questions on their smartphones, and analyses their language to see if they're the right cultural fit for a role.\n\nAnd UK start-up JamieAi focuses on matching candidates with the right credentials for relevant job openings, seeking to eliminate bias by excluding demographic factors, such as name, age or ethnicity.\n\nImage copyright Dr Malin Lindel\u00f6w Image caption Dr Malin Lindel\u00f6w has several concerns about the use of robots in recruitment\n\nSwedish recruiter TNG says interviewees have enjoyed their encounters with Tengai. But some professionals have concerns.\n\nDr Malin Lindel\u00f6w, a Swedish psychologist who specialises in recruitment, says: \"Recruiting is very much a leap of faith. It's a huge investment. It's a huge commitment. And you need to believe in the decision that you make.\n\n\"I find it very difficult to believe that recruiting managers will rely on a robot.\"\n\nShe also points out that interviews - especially those in sectors where there is a skills shortage - can be as much about job seekers deciding whether or not they want to work for a company as the reverse.\n\n\"The candidate will come to the interview thinking: 'Is this a place where I want to work? 'Is this somebody I want to work with?' They get their own gut feeling and it will affect their decision a great deal,\" she says.\n\n\"I am very concerned about what robots may do to that part of the process.\""

    "authors": [
      "Zaria Gorvett"
    ],
    "text": "Celebrated inventor and physicist Nikola Tesla swore by toe exercises \u2013 every night, he\u2019d repeatedly \u2018squish\u2019 his toes, 100 times for each foot, according to the author Marc J Seifer. While it\u2019s not entirely clear exactly what that exercise involved, Tesla claimed it helped to stimulate his brain cells.\n\nThe most prolific mathematician of the 20th Century, Paul Erdos, preferred a different kind of stimulant: amphetamine, which he used to fuel 20-hour number benders. When a friend bet him $500 that he couldn\u2019t stop for a month, he won but complained \u201cYou\u2019ve set mathematics back a month\u201d.\n\nNewton, meanwhile, bragged about the benefits of celibacy. When he died in 1727, he had transformed our understanding of the natural world forever and left behind 10 million words of notes; he was also, by all accounts, still a virgin (Tesla was also celibate, though he later claimed he fell in love with a pigeon).\n\nLike it or not, our daily habits have a powerful impact on our brains\n\nMany of the world\u2019s most brilliant scientific minds were also fantastically weird. From Pythagoras\u2019 outright ban on beans to Benjamin Franklin\u2019s naked \u2018air baths\u2019, the path to greatness is paved with some truly peculiar habits.\n\nBut what if these are more than superficial facts? Scientists are increasingly realising that intelligence is less about sheer genetic luck than we tend to think. According to the latest review of the evidence, around 40% of what distinguishes the brainiacs from the blockheads in adulthood is environmental. Like it or not, our daily habits have a powerful impact on our brains, shaping their structure and changing the way we think.\n\nOf all history\u2019s great minds, arguably the master of combining genius with unusual habits was Albert Einstein \u2013 so what better person to study for clues to mind-enhancing behaviours to try ourselves? He taught us how to squeeze energy out of atoms, so maybe, just maybe, he might be able to teach us a thing or two about how to squeeze the most out of our tiny mortal brains. Could there be any benefits in following Einstein\u2019s sleep, diet, and even fashion choices?\n\n10 HOURS OF SLEEP AND ONE-SECOND NAPS\n\nIt\u2019s common knowledge that sleep is good for your brain \u2013 and Einstein took this advice more seriously than most. He reportedly slept for at least 10 hours per day \u2013 nearly one and a half times as much as the average American today (6.8 hours). But can you really slumber your way to a sharper mind?\n\nThe author John Steinbeck once said: \u201cIt is a common experience that a problem difficult at night is resolved in the morning after the committee of sleep has worked on it.\u201d\n\nMany of the most radical breakthroughs in human history, including the periodic table, the structure of DNA and Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity, have supposedly occurred while their discoverer was unconscious. The latter came to Einstein while he was dreaming about cows being electrocuted. But is this really true?\n\nBack in 2004, scientists at the University of Lubeck, Germany, tested the idea with a simple experiment. First they trained volunteers to play a number game. Most gradually got the hang of it with practice, but by far the quickest way to improve was to uncover a hidden rule. When the students were tested again eight hours later, those who had been allowed to sleep were more than twice as likely to gain insight into the rules than those who had remained awake.\n\nThose who have more spindle events tend to have greater \u2018fluid intelligence\u2019\n\nWhen we fall asleep, the brain enters a series of cycles. Every 90-120 minutes the brain fluctuates between light sleep, deep sleep and a phase associated with dreaming, known as Rapid Eye Movement (REM), which until recently was thought to play the leading role in learning and memory. But this isn\u2019t the full story. \u201cNon-REM sleep has been a bit of a mystery, but we spend about 60% of our night in this type of sleep,\u201d says Stuart Fogel, a neuroscientist at the University of Ottawa.\n\nNon-REM sleep is characterised by bursts of fast brain activity, so called \u2018spindle events\u2019 because of the spindle-shaped zigzag the waves trace on an EEG. A normal night\u2019s sleep will involve thousands of these, each lasting no longer than a few seconds. \u201cThis is really the gateway to other stages of sleep \u2013 the more you sleep, the more of these events you\u2019ll have,\u201d he says.\n\nSpindle events begin with a surge of electrical energy generated by the rapid firing of structures deep in the brain. The main culprit is the thalamus, an oval shaped region which acts as the brain\u2019s main \u2018switching centre\u2019, sending incoming sensory signals in the right direction. While we\u2019re sleeping, it acts like an internal earplug, scrambling external information to help you stay asleep. During a spindle event, the surge travels up to the brain\u2019s surface and then back down again to complete a loop.\n\nIntriguingly, those who have more spindle events tend to have greater \u2018fluid intelligence\u2019 \u2013 the ability to solve new problems, use logic in new situations, and identify patterns \u2013 the kind Einstein had in spades. \"They don\u2019t seem related to other types of intelligence, such as the ability to memorise facts and figures, so it\u2019s really specific to these reasoning skills,\" says Fogel. This ties in nicely with Einstein\u2019s disdain for formal education and advice to \"never memorise anything which you can look up\".\n\nAnd though the more you sleep, the more spindle events you\u2019ll have, this doesn\u2019t necessarily prove that more sleep is beneficial. It\u2019s a chicken and egg scenario: do some people have more spindle events because they are smart, or are they smart because they have more spindle events? The jury is still out, but a recent study showed that night-time sleep in women \u2013 and napping in men \u2013 can improve reasoning and problem solving skills. Crucially, the boost to intelligence was linked to the presence of spindle events, which only occurred during night-time sleep in women and daytime slumbers in men.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet known why spindle events would be helpful, but Fogel thinks it may have something to do with the regions which are activated. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that the same regions that generate spindles \u2013 the thalamus and the cortex [the brain\u2019s surface] \u2013 well, these are the areas which support the ability to solve problems and apply logic in new situations,\u201d he says.\n\nLuckily for Einstein, he also took regular naps. According to apocryphal legend, to make sure he didn\u2019t overdo it he\u2019d recline in his armchair with a spoon in his hand and a metal plate directly beneath. He\u2019d allow himself to drift off for a second, then \u2013 bam! \u2013 the spoon would fall from his hand and the sound of it hitting the plate would wake him up.\n\nDAILY WALKS\n\nEinstein\u2019s daily walk was sacred to him. While he was working at Princeton University, New Jersey, he\u2019d walk the mile and a half journey there and back. He followed in the footsteps of other diligent walkers, including Darwin who went for three 45 minute walks every day.\n\nThese constitutionals weren\u2019t just for fitness \u2013 there\u2019s mountains of evidence that walking can boost memory, creativity and problem-solving. For creativity at least, walking outside is even better. But why?\n\nWhen you think about it, it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. Walking distracts the brain from more cerebral tasks, and forces it to focus on putting one foot in front of the other and not falling over. Enter \u2018transient hypofrontality\u2019 \u2013 translated into basic English, this impressive mouthful basically means temporarily toning down the activity in certain parts of the brain. In particular, the frontal lobes, which are involved in higher processes such as memory, judgement and language.\n\nBy turning it down a notch, the brain adopts a totally different style of thinking \u2013 one which may lead to insights you wouldn\u2019t get at your desk. There isn\u2019t any evidence for this explanation of walking\u2019s benefits yet, but it\u2019s a tantalising idea.\n\nEATING SPAGHETTI\n\nSo what do geniuses eat? Alas, it\u2019s not clear what fuelled Einstein\u2019s extraordinary mind, though the internet somewhat dubiously claims it was spaghetti. He did once joke that his favourite things about Italy were \u201cspaghetti and [mathematician] Levi-Civita\u201d, so we\u2019ll go with that.\n\nThough carbohydrates have got a bad rep, as always, Einstein was spot on. It\u2019s well known that the brain is a food-guzzling greedy guts, consuming 20% of the body\u2019s energy though it only accounts for 2% of its weight (Einstein\u2019s may have been even less \u2013 his brain weighed just 1,230g, compared to an average of around 1,400g). Just like the rest of the body, the brain prefers to snack on simple sugars, such as glucose, which have been broken down from carbohydrates. Neurons require an almost-contunuous supply and will only accept other energy sources when it\u2019s really desperate. And therein lies a problem.\n\nDespite this sweet tooth, the brain has no way of storing any energy, so when blood glucose levels drop, it quickly runs out. \u201cThe body can release some from its own glycogen stores by releasing stress hormones such as cortisol, but these have side-effects,\u201d says Leigh Gibson, a lecturer in psychology and physiology at the University of Roehampton.\n\nThese include the familiar light-headedness and confusion we feel when we skip dinner. One study found that those on low carbohydrate diets have slower reaction times and reduced spatial memory \u2013 though only in the short-term (after a few weeks, the brain will adapt to salvaging energy from other sources, such as protein).\n\nSugars can give the brain a valuable boost, but unfortunately this doesn\u2019t mean binging on spaghetti is a good idea. \u201cTypically the evidence suggests that about 25g of carbohydrate is beneficial, but double that and you may actually impair your ability to think,\u201d says Gibson. For perspective, that\u2019s around 37 strands of spaghetti, which is a lot less than it sounds (around half as much as the recommended portion). \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple a story as it sounds,\u201d says Gibson.\n\nSMOKING A PIPE\n\nToday, the many health risks of smoking are widely known, so this is not a habit that it would be wise to follow. But Einstein was a hardened pipe smoker, known as much around campus for the cloud of smoke which followed him as for his theories. He famously loved to smoke, believing it \u201ccontributes to a somewhat calm and objective judgment in all human affairs.\u201d He\u2019d even pick cigarette butts off the street and stuff the remaining tobacco into his pipe.\n\nNot really the behaviour of a genius, but in his defence, though evidence had been mounting since the 1940s, tobacco wasn\u2019t publicly linked to lung cancer and other illnesses until 1962 \u2013 seven years after his death.\n\nToday the risks are no secret \u2013 smoking stops brain cells forming, thins the cerebral cortex (the wrinkled outer layer responsible for consciousness) and starves the brain of oxygen. It\u2019s fair to say that Einstein was clever despite this habit \u2013 not because of it.\n\nBut there is one final mystery. An analysis of 20,000 adolescents in the United States, whose habits and health were followed for 15 years, found that irrespective of age, ethnicity or education, more intelligent children grow up to smoke more cigarettes, more frequently, than the rest of us. Scientists still don\u2019t know why this is, though intriguingly it\u2019s not true everywhere \u2013 in the UK, smokers tend to have lower IQs.\n\nNO SOCKS\n\nNo list of Einstein\u2019s eccentricities would be complete without a mention of his passionate aversion to socks. \u201cWhen I was young,\u201d he wrote in a letter to his cousin \u2013 and later, wife \u2013 Elsa, \u201cI found out that the big toe always ends up making a hole in a sock. So I stopped wearing socks.\u201d Later in life, when he couldn\u2019t find his sandals he\u2019d wear Elsa\u2019s sling backs instead.\n\nAs it turns out, rocking the hipster look probably didn\u2019t do Einstein any favours. Regrettably, there haven\u2019t been any studies looking directly at the impact of going sockless, but changing into casual clothing, as opposed to a more formal outfit, has been linked to poor performance on tests of abstract thinking.\n\nAnd what better way to end that with some advice from the man himself. \u201cThe important thing is not to stop questioning; curiosity has its own reason for existing,\u201d he told LIFE magazine in 1955.\n\nFailing that, you might try some toe exercises. Who knows \u2013 they might just work.

It is officially recognised in various \u2018denomenaci\u00f3ns de origen\u2019, geographical indicators similar to the appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e used in France for wine and other products. One such region with its own denominaci\u00f3n de origen is Jabugo, the area around a small town of the same name in Andaluc\u00eda, which is famously devoted to producing the ham.\n\nJam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico de bellota (jam\u00f3n from pigs fed on bellota, or acorns) tends to be the most gourmet version and is produced across the various regions, including Jabugo. Rather than being produced from animals raised purely on feed, to be recognised as \u2018de bellota\u2019, the pigs must graze only on fresh pasture and acorns that fall from oak trees for at least 61 days of the year (though the acorn period usually extends longer than two months).\n\nTo help consumers navigate this complex set of factors, Spain introduced a colour-coding system in 2014 that categorises jam\u00f3n according to quality, with a black label being the highest."

    "text": "In 1989, Silvano de Gennaro, a computer scientist at the Cern laboratory in Switzerland, decided to start a music festival that still runs to this day. He called it the Cern Hardronic Festival and invited the Cern community to get up on stage and showcase their talents. Little did he know that his festival would lead to the creation of a girl group whose picture would be the first personal photograph to be uploaded to the web.\n\nMichele de Gennaro, who is now married to Silvano, remembers the first festival clearly. She was working as a bilingual secretary when a friend approached her about the show. Her friend planned to get Silvano to write a song to a particular physicist who she had her eye on, and wanted Michele to join her on stage.\n\nSo Silvano wrote a song called Collider, about a lonely woman whose partner works long shifts at \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 the collider. Watch it here.\n\nUnfortunately, the desired physicist never actually saw the performance, Michele says, since he was on shift. \u201cIt was a shame but we had a great time and we got a lot of attention from elsewhere,\u201d she says. Thus was born Les Horribles Cernettes (a play on Cern\u2019s Large Hadron Collider), a revolving group of female singers who donned big hair, vintage dresses, and sang songs about physics.\n\nThis parody group with big hairdos and dresses reminiscent of the 50s, doing song of physics. I thought \u2018that\u2019s fantastic\u2019 - Lynn Veronneau\n\nLynn Veronneau, then a research administrator at Cern, remembers seeing the Cernettes for the first time at a festival on the campus. \u201cI was there when these girls came on and I loved them!\u201d she said. \u201cThis parody group with big hairdos and dresses reminiscent of the 50s, doing songs of physics. I thought \u2018that\u2019s fantastic\u2019. I was studying opera at the time and I thought \u2018I want to be in that band!\u2019\u201d A year later, she was one of the Cernettes.\n\nOne day, Michele, Lynn, and the other Cernettes members at the time, were backstage at a gig, make-up done, ready to go on, when Silvano appeared with a camera. \u201cOkay girls, give me a shot for the album cover,\u2019 he said. They posed, squatting together, with big smiles.\n\nLater, Silvano was working on the photo on his computer \u2013 editing out the messy background so it could be used for the album cover \u2013 when Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, walked into his office. When he saw the image, he told Silvano that he should make the Cernettes a website. \u201cI hardly knew what the web was,\u201d Silvano says. At the time his work involved running software on servers at Cern. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really working on it.\u201d\n\nIt was the photo that opened the web to life\n\nBerners-Lee decided to create a webpage for all the social activities at Cern and he included the picture of the Cernettes on the page for the music club. This first version of the image was tiny by today\u2019s standards; in those days, the web couldn\u2019t handle large pictures. Silvano says that the image was probably 120 pixels by 50 pixels. \u201cIt was the size of a stamp and took about one minute to load on your screen.\u201d Because they took so long to materialise, pictures didn\u2019t load on the website automatically, you had to click on them to get the image to appear.\n\nAlthough this photo of the Cernettes is commonly called \u201cthe first photograph uploaded to the internet\u201d that\u2019s not completely accurate. For starters, the internet existed before the web. And as the web was built for physicists to share data, that data often included scientific images. There were loads of images already on the web long before the Cernettes\u2019 photograph made its way there. But the photo of the four women is the first non-technical picture uploaded to the web. The first picture that was simply a photo for fun, not work. \u201cIt was the photo that opened the web to life,\u201d says Silvano.\n\nIt was the size of a stamp and took about one minute to load on your screen\n\nLynn didn\u2019t realise until about five years ago that the photo had a special place in history. Even then she says she didn\u2019t really understand what the big deal was. \u201cI was starting a big musical project and I remember having this conversation with our publicist at the time, who said, \u2018oh my god that\u2019s a piece of history, we\u2019ve got to put that in your bio.\u2019\u201d Now, Lynn embraces her part of history. \u201cI can tell my friends and family I was incredibly privileged to accidentally be in the first picture uploaded,\u201d she says.\n\nWhen I asked Michele if she had any sense that the photo they were taking would become iconic she laughed. \u201cNo of course not, no my goodness.\u201d But she says that, like Lynn, she now appreciates being a part of history.\n\nWe look so beautiful and wonderful in that picture. I love it\n\nToday, the Cernettes are scattered across the globe. Michele and Silvano live in Mauritius, where Michele is a pilates instructor. Lynn is a professional musician, who tours the world with her jazz band. Angela Higney, the Cernette on the left in the photo now lives in Glasgow and works as a vocal coach. Collete Marx-Nielsen, the woman in the silvery sequin dress, lives in France. In 2012, the original four Cernettes reunited at Cern, and were joined by a whole group of later Cernettes for a concert; Lynn says she was blown away by how excited people were. \u201cThe response at the reunion concert was overwhelming. It was huge, there were so many people who came and there were a lot of people online \u2013 we webcast it and over 2000 people logged in.\u201d\n\nThis is something very special about that first photo of the Cernettes, says Michele. \u201cIt was maybe one of the first bands on the internet. We look so beautiful and wonderful in that picture. I love it.\u201d\n\nCorrection: This article has been edited to reflect the difference between the web and the internet.\n\nJoin 500,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn and Instagram\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "text": "When young adults start university, they often gain weight. In the United States, they have a name for this phenomenon: the \"freshman 15\", referring to the 15lbs typically accrued during students\u2019 first year of living away from home. In part, this weight gain can be explained by the substitution of home-cooked meals for ready meals and fast food, combined with reduction in physical activity.\n\nIncreasingly, however, scientists are fingering an additional suspect: circadian disruption, brought about by a culture of late-night eating, drinking, and inconsistent sleep patterns.\n\nFor decades, we\u2019ve been told that weight gain, together with associated diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease, are a simple matter of the quantity and type of food we consume, balanced with the number of calories we expend through exercise. But mounting evidence suggests that timing is also important: it\u2019s not just what you eat, but when you eat that matters.\n\nThe idea that our response to food varies at different times of day dates back a long way. Ancient Chinese medics believed that energy flowed around the body in parallel with the sun\u2019s movements, and that our meals should be timed accordingly: 7-9am was the time of the stomach, when the biggest meal of the day should be consumed; 9-11am centred on the pancreas and spleen; 11am-1pm was the time of the heart, and so on. Dinner, they believed, should be a light affair, consumed between 5pm and 7pm, which was when kidney function predominated.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nAlthough the explanation is different, modern science suggests that there is plenty of truth in that ancient wisdom.\n\nDieters consumed most of their calories at breakfast lost two and a half times more weight than those who had a light breakfast and ate most of their calories at dinner\n\nConsider studies of dieters. Most weight-loss schemes revolve around reducing the overall number of calories consumed \u2013 but what if the timing also determined the benefits? When overweight and obese women were put on a weight-loss diet for three months, those who consumed most of their calories at breakfast lost two and a half times more weight than those who had a light breakfast and ate most of their calories at dinner \u2013 even though they consumed the same number of calories overall.\n\nMany people think that the reason you gain more weight if you eat late at night is because you have less opportunity to burn off those calories, but this is simplistic. \u201cPeople sometimes assume that our bodies shut down when asleep, but that\u2019s not true,\u201d says Jonathan Johnston at the University of Surrey, who studies how our body clocks interact with food.\n\nSo, what else could be going on? Some preliminary evidence suggests that more energy is used to process a meal when it\u2019s eaten in the morning, compared with later in the day, so you burn slightly more calories if you eat earlier. However, it\u2019s still unclear how much of a difference this would make to overall body weight.\n\nAnother possibility is that late-night eating extends the overall window during which food is consumed. This gives our digestive systems less time to recuperate and reduces the opportunity for our bodies to burn fat \u2013 because fat-burning only occurs when our organs realise that no more food is coming their way.\n\nThe majority of North Americans eat over the course of 15 or more hours each day\n\nPrior to the invention of electric light, humans woke at roughly around dawn and went to bed several hours after the sun set, with almost all food being consumed during daylight hours. \u201cUnless we have access to light, we struggle to stay awake and eat at the wrong time,\u201d says Satchin Panda, a circadian biologist at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, and author of The Circadian Code. His own research has revealed that the majority of North Americans eat over the course of 15 or more hours each day, with more than a third of the day\u2019s calories consumed after 6pm, which is very different to how our ancestors must have lived.\n\nNow consider those college students, eating and drinking long into the night. \u201cA typical college student rarely goes to sleep before midnight, and they also tend to eat until midnight,\u201d Panda says. Yet, many students will still need to get up for classes the next day, which \u2013 assuming they eat breakfast \u2013 reduces the length of their night-time fast still further.\n\nIt also means that they are cutting short their sleep, and this too could make them more likely to gain weight. Inadequate sleep impairs decision-making and self-control, potentially leading to poor food choices, and it disrupts levels of the \u201chunger hormones\u201d, leptin and ghrelin, boosting appetite.\n\nIt is now becoming clear that our circadian rhythms are intimately connected to our digestion and metabolism in many other ways, through the body\u2019s intricate signalling pathways \u2013 a new understanding that could explain the long-term effects of jet lag and shift work.\n\nInside every cell of your body, there ticks a molecular clock that regulates the timing of pretty much every physiological process and behaviour, from the release of hormones and neurotransmitters, to your blood pressure, the activity of your immune cells, and when you feel more sleepy, alert, or depressed. These clocks are kept in synchrony with each other, and with the time of day outside, through signals from a small patch of brain tissue called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). And its window on the outside world are a subset of light-responsive cells at the back of the eye called intrinsically photoreceptive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGs).\n\nThe point of all these \u201ccircadian\u201d clocks is to anticipate and prepare for regular events in our environment, such as the arrival of food. It means that different biochemical reactions are favoured at various times of day, allowing our internal organs to task-switch and recuperate.\n\nWhen we travel abroad, the timing of our light exposure changes, and our body clocks are pulled in the same direction \u2013 although the clocks in different organs and tissues adapt at different rates. The result is jet lag, which not only leaves us feeling sleepy or awake at the wrong times, but can also trigger digestive problems and general malaise.\n\nHowever, light isn\u2019t the only thing that can change the timing of our clocks. When we eat our meals can also shift the hands of the clocks in the liver and digestive organs, even though the clocks in our brain cells are unaffected. Recent evidence also suggests that the timing of exercise can tweak the clocks in our muscle cells.\n\nWhen we fly across time zones, or eat, sleep and exercise at irregular times, the various clocks in our organs and tissues fall out of synchrony with one another. This is unlikely to be a problem if you just have the occasional late-night meal or lie-in, but if it\u2019s a regular occurrence this may have longer-term consequences for our health.\n\nComplex processes, such as the metabolism of fats or carbohydrates from the diet, require the coordination of numerous processes occurring in the gut, liver, pancreas, muscle and fatty tissue. If the conversation between these tissues becomes scrambled, they become less efficient, which over the long term may increase our risk of various diseases.\n\nIn one recent study, researchers compared the physical effects of sleeping for five hours per night for eight days in a row, with getting the same amount of sleep but at irregular times. In both groups, people\u2019s sensitivity to the hormone insulin dropped and systemic inflammation increased, escalating the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease. However, these effects were even greater in those who were sleeping at irregular times (and whose circadian rhythms were therefore knocked out of alignment): in men, the reduction in insulin sensitivity and increase in inflammation doubled.\n\nThat could be a problem for frequent flyers, students who regularly sleep in, or any shift workers. According to European and North American surveys, some 15 to 30% of the working population is engaged in some form of shift work, which often equates to eating or being active when the body isn\u2019t expecting it. Shift work has been linked to a host of conditions, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity and depression, and circadian disruption brought about by this irregularity is a prime suspect.\n\nHowever, we are all shift workers at least some of the time, says Panda. An estimated 87% of the general population maintains a different sleep schedule on weekdays, compared to weekends, resulting in social jet lag. People also tend to eat breakfast at least an hour later at the weekends, which can result in so-called \u201cmetabolic-jetlag\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s not only consistency in the timing of meals, but in the amount of food we eat at each meal that seems to be important.\n\nGerda Pot is a nutrition researcher at King\u2019s College London, investigating how day-to-day irregularity in people\u2019s energy intake affects their long-term health. She was inspired by her grandmother, Hammy Timmerman, who was rigorous about routine. Each day she\u2019d eat breakfast at 7am; lunch at 12.30pm, and dinner at 6pm. Even the timing of her snacks was intransigent: coffee at 11.30am; tea at 3pm. When Pot came to visit, she soon learned that sleeping in was a mistake: \u201cIf I woke up at 10am, she\u2019d still insist I ate breakfast, and then we\u2019d be having coffee and a cookie half an hour later,\u201d she says. Increasingly, though, she is convinced that her grandmother\u2019s rigid routine helped keep her in good health until she was almost 95.\n\nThere are some good reasons why this might be. Our sensitivity to the hormone insulin, which enables the glucose from the food we eat to enter our cells and be used as fuel, is greater during the morning than at night. When we eat late (as Hammy Timmerman never did), that glucose remains in our blood for longer, which over the long term can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, where the pancreas no longer produces enough insulin. It can also damage tissues elsewhere, such as blood vessels or nerves in the eyes and feet. In the worst cases, this can result in blindness, or amputations.\n\nUsing data from a UK national survey which has tracked the health of more than 5,000 people for over 70 years, Pot found that, even though they consumed fewer calories overall, people who had a more irregular meal routine had a higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome \u2013 a cluster of conditions, including high blood pressure, elevated blood sugar levels, excess fat around the waist and abnormal fat and cholesterol levels in their blood, which together increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.\n\nSo, what should we do about it? Striving for greater consistency in the timing of our sleep and meals is a good first step, and ideally, all our clocks should be operating on the same time zone. When we open the curtains and see bright light in the morning, this resets the master clock in the brain, so by eating breakfast soon afterward, this reinforces the message that its morning to the clocks in our liver and digestive system. Eating a good breakfast may therefore be essential to keeping our circadian clocks running in synchrony.\n\nIndeed, a recent study involving 18 healthy individuals, and 18 with type 2 diabetes, found that skipping breakfast led to disrupted circadian rhythms in both groups, as well as greater spikes in blood glucose levels when they finally did eat.\n\nHowever, regularising our schedules shouldn\u2019t come at the expense of missed sleep. Although it\u2019s unlikely that the occasional lie-in will cause you any harm, we should generally be striving to go to bed at a time that will allow us to get adequate sleep \u2013 the recommended amount is seven to eight hours for most adults \u2013 on every day of the week. Here, light exposure could help. Dimming the lights in the evenings and getting more exposure to bright light during the day time has been shown to shift the timing of the master clock in the brain (the SCN) several hours earlier, making people more lark-like. (Read more: What I learnt by living without artificial light.)\n\nSome are advocating a more hardcore approach of forgoing all food for at least 12 hours, and possibly for as long as 14-16 hours overnight. In a landmark study published in 2012, Panda and his colleagues compared one set of mice that had access to fatty and sugary foods at any time of day or night, with another group that could only consumed these foods within an eight to 12-hour window during their \u201cdaytime\u201d. Even though they consumed the same number of calories, the mice whose eating window was restricted appeared to be completely protected from the diseases that began to afflict the other group: obesity, diabetes, heart disease and liver damage. What\u2019s more, when mice with these illnesses were placed on a time-restricted eating schedule, they became well again.\n\n\u201cAlmost every animal, including us, evolved on this planet with a very strong 24-hour rhythm in light and darkness, and the associated rhythms in eating and fasting,\u201d explains Panda. \u201cWe think a major function [of these cycles] is to enable repair and rejuvenation each night. You cannot repair a highway when the traffic is still moving.\u201d\n\nHuman trials of time-restricted eating are just beginning, but some of the early results look promising \u2013 at least in certain groups. For instance, when eight men with prediabetes were randomised to eat all their meals between 8am and 3pm, their sensitivity to insulin improved and their blood pressure dropped by 10-11 points on average, compared to when they consumed the same meals within a 12-hour period.\n\nQuite what this means for the rest of us is unclear at this point, but the adage that you should breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dine like a pauper has never seemed truer. And it\u2019s almost certainly worth fitting a padlock on the fridge overnight.\n\n--\n\nLinda Geddes is a science journalist and the author of Chasing The Sun: The new science of sunlight and how it shapes our bodies and minds, published by Wellcome Collection.\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "text": "The school next to Grenfell Tower asks Gareth Malone to help pupils create a concert to mark the reopening of their building. They find they have a unique and moving story to tell.\n\n\u201cWe are typical teenagers who happened to be in the area Grenfell happened.\u201d In June 2017, Kensington Aldridge Academy, the school next to the tower, had to relocate following the fire that claimed 72 lives. Five of the victims were students of the school.\n\nIn this two-part series, we hear from the pupils of KAA as choirmaster Gareth Malone helps them create a concert to mark their return.\n\nIn episode one, principal David Benson invites Gareth to spend the summer term in KAA\u2019s temporary home \u2013 a collection of swiftly assembled temporary accommodation a mile away. David hopes the school will return to their original site in September and wants to mark the occasion with a concert. KAA specialises in performing arts and David believes passionately in the value of music and singing. He asks Gareth to help the students produce a performance that will celebrate their pride in the community, their happy memories and the courage and resilience they have shown.\n\nGareth gets to work with the existing choir. It is small but rehearses once a week after school. In his first session Gareth discovers one pupil is named Lyric and asks the 14-year-old if, with a name like that, she has ever written any. Suddenly Lyric performs a song she has penned as a tribute to lost friends. Lyric has never sung it to anyone and her best friend and fellow choir member Olivia is moved to tears.\n\nOlivia\u2019s mum, Svetlana, describes how her daughter is coping: she has good days and bad days. If the school hadn\u2019t been so quick to provide support, she would have suffered a lot more.\n\nWhat impresses Gareth about Lyric\u2019s song is that it comes from her own experience. He is convinced the return performance should be created by the children. It can tell the story of KAA from its beginnings, and look ahead to the future. When he shares the plan for an original musical with the head, David is taken aback. This is more risky than the covers of pop songs he imagined, but he recognises it could be much more powerful.\n\nMeanwhile the Grenfell Inquiry has started and David comes under pressure as a small but vocal minority of parents express concern about the plan to return to the original building. They have questions about safety and the emotional effect on students. David wants parents to be confident his focus is on the kids and that consultation about the move back is gradual and careful. He worries that Gareth's work with the pupils could give the impression that the outcome is already decided. He instructs Gareth to scale back, limiting him to taking only the weekly choir rehearsals.\n\nDespite the restriction, Gareth finds at the next rehearsal that the choir is growing. He has a new goal for them: to create a song to be performed at the end of term assembly. The kids respond immediately.\n\nGareth is encouraged by the songwriting, and is particularly impressed by 14-year-old Adil, who was at the forefront of the creative process and came up with \u2018Life is short, your days are limited, you want to be the best you can be.\u2019 Adil tells us these words are drawn from his own life. He has been in foster care since he was three, with a succession of foster parents. He has been with his present foster family for four years.\n\nAdil admits his experiences have set him back at school, and we learn from his teacher that he can be disruptive in class and confrontational with staff. He has strong emotions but doesn\u2019t know how to cope with them. He finds it hard to trust people due to the upheaval in his life, and to make matters worse, he is now having a tough time at his current foster placement.\n\nThe process of safety checks and consultation about the move back concludes. In a poll of students and parents, an overwhelming majority vote to return. Gareth gets back to promoting the final performance. He organises a lunchtime open mic session for the whole school as a chance to have fun, and to show that the concert is for everyone, not just the choir.\n\nThe song the choir will perform at end of term assembly is coming together, with two Year 10 boys, Jeriel and Cam\u2019ron, contributing spoken word sections. Adil hasn\u2019t been back to choir, but turns up on the day before the assembly. He tells Gareth he has been moved to a new foster placement. It is two hours from school and he doubts he will make it in time for the performance.\n\nWithout space for all 1,000 pupils to gather, KAA borrows the sports hall of the neighbouring school for the assembly. For the choir, it is the first time they put their original material to the test. Adil arrives in time, but won\u2019t join the choir. Gareth can\u2019t persuade him - all he can do is use his introduction to credit Adil for his contribution.\n\nThe performance starts, but something no one could predict halts the singers mid-flow. For Adil, the interruption is an opportunity to reflect on his place in the choir."

    "title": "Return of the cat man of Aleppo",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Meet the cat man of Aleppo\n\nThe cat man of Aleppo, Mohammad Aljaleel, touched the hearts of millions when his sanctuary featured in a BBC video in 2016 (above). He had to leave the city when it fell to Syrian government forces, but he's now back - in an area nearby - and helping children as well as animals, reports Diana Darke.\n\nJust weeks after the video was filmed, Mohammad Aljaleel (known to everyone as Alaa) watched helplessly as his cat sanctuary was first bombed, then chlorine-gassed, during the intense final stages of the siege of Aleppo.\n\nMost of his 180 cats were lost or killed. Like thousands of other civilians he was trapped in the eastern half of the city under continuous bombardment from Russian and Syrian fighter jets.\n\nAs the siege tightened, he was forced from one Aleppo district to another, witnessing unimaginable scenes of devastation. Yet throughout, he continued to look after the few surviving cats and to rescue people injured in the bombing, driving them to underground hospitals.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The evacuation of east Aleppo in December 2016\n\nWhen the city fell in December 2016, he left in a convoy, his van crammed full of injured people and the last six cats from the sanctuary.\n\n\"I've always felt it's my duty and my pleasure to help people and animals whenever they need help,\" Alaa says. \"I believe that whoever does this will be the happiest person in the world, besides being lucky in his life.\"\n\nAfter a brief recuperation in Turkey, he smuggled himself back into Syria - bringing a Turkish cat with him for company - and established a new cat sanctuary, bigger and better than the first one, in Kafr Naha, a village in opposition-held countryside west of Aleppo.\n\nUsing the same crowdfunding model employed successfully in east Aleppo, funds were sent in by cat-lovers from all over the world via Facebook and Twitter.\n\nBut Alaa has always worked for the benefit of the community, as well as the cats themselves.\n\nIn Aleppo, he and his team of helpers bought generators, dug wells and stockpiled food. Even at the height of the bombing, they ran animal welfare courses for children, to develop their empathy. They also set up a playground next to the sanctuary where children could briefly escape from the apocalyptic events taking place all around them.\n\nImage caption Alaa and a cat called Ernesto\n\nThe new sanctuary has expanded to include an orphanage, a kindergarten and a veterinary clinic. Alaa and his team resemble a small development agency, providing services that government and international charities cannot or will not. He strongly believes that helping children to look after vulnerable animals teaches them the importance of kindness to all living creatures, and helps to heal their own war traumas.\n\n\"Children and animals are the big losers in the Syrian war,\" he says. \"It's the adults who so often behave badly.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Alaa rescues a child from rubble in Aleppo in 2016\n\nAs a boy growing up in Aleppo, Alaa had always looked after cats, spurring his friends to do likewise, even though keeping cats and dogs as pets is not customary in Syria or the rest of the Arab world.\n\nHe started working aged 13, as an electrician, but also turned his hand to many other jobs - painter, decorator, IT expert, satellite-dish installer\u2026 he even traded toys between Lebanon and Syria.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nHe worked hard and he learned how to get things done. \"May the dust turn to gold in your hands, Alaa,\" his mother used to say.\n\nHis dream was to become a fireman like his father and work in search and rescue, but such jobs were handed out only to those with connections, and the connection through his father was not enough. So for years his applications were rejected.\n\nImage caption The sanctuary's vet, Dr Youssef\n\n\"Of course I would never have wished for a war in order to make my dream come true. I wish I could have achieved these things without the suffering I have seen,\" he says.\n\n\"God blessed me by putting me in a position where I could help people by being a rescue man, but in my worst nightmares I never imagined a war like this for my people or for my country, or even for a single animal.\"\n\nDuring the siege in Aleppo he used to visit both Christian and Muslim old people's homes, distributing food. Extremist groups such as al-Qaeda-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra regularly chided him, calling him a kaafir, an unbeliever, but he continued regardless.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\n\"Our Prophet Muhammad was good to everybody. He spoke with all Christians and Jews. I believe in Moses, Jesus and Muhammad, because all of them had a noble aim. I'm a Muslim, but I am not a fanatic. I just take from religion everything that's good and that I can learn things from,\" Alaa says.\n\nDespite the difficulties he has endured, Alaa has always maintained a wicked sense of humour. At the new sanctuary, a tabby called Maxi the Marketing King is chief fundraiser, soliciting \"green kisses\" in the form of dollar bills via social media accounts.\n\nImage caption Maxi, chief fundraiser\n\nAlaa wears a T-shirt with \"Maxi's Slave\" written on it, and gets ticked off for smoking too much or for not cooking gourmet meals. He admits his shortcomings. \"We submit to Maxi's authority as the ruler of his kingdom. But even with Maxi's leadership it wasn't easy to launch the new sanctuary,\" he says.\n\nThis is an understatement. The rebel-held area where Alaa now lives is semi-lawless and when powerful gangs realised he was receiving funds for the sanctuary, they attempted to kidnap him. He was no longer being bombed, but his life was still at risk.\n\nAs well as cats, the new sanctuary has dogs, monkeys, rabbits, a chicken that thinks it's a cat, and an Arabian thoroughbred horse.\n\n\"There are so few thoroughbred horses left inside Syria now that I worry about finding him a mare to breed with. I plan to perform the role of a traditional Syrian mother and try to find him a wife, so that he can have children and start building up the population of thoroughbred horses in Syria again,\" Alaa says.\n\nImage caption An injured fox, rescued by the sanctuary...\n\nAll the animals have names, generally awarded by Alaa. An aggressive black-and-white cat who came to the sanctuary, stole food and terrified all the other cats was nicknamed al-Baghdadi, after the Iraqi leader of Islamic State (IS).\n\n\"Of course, this cat was a million times better than that evil murderer al-Baghdadi, but this name came to mind because his presence in the sanctuary coincided with the arrival of IS gangs in Aleppo,\" Alaa says.\n\nImage caption ... a cockerel that behaves like a cat...\n\nA large ginger tomcat was given a Trump hairstyle and christened The Orange President of the Sanctuary. A pair of speedy acrobatic cats were called Sukhoi 25 and Sukhoi 26, after Russian fighter jets.\n\n\"They're old planes, but effective enough for the job required of them in Syria. We always knew when the Russians were coming to bomb us because of their very loud engine noise. We'd shout: 'Watch out! A Sukhoi is coming!'\"\n\nAlaa's reputation inside Syria has travelled far and wide, and the government is well aware of his activities.\n\nImage caption ... and a resident bird of prey\n\nIn 2017 he was called by the Magic World Zoo, south of Aleppo, which asked desperately for his help to feed the neglected lions, tigers and bears - which he did, despite the dangers of the journey which involved passing through Jabhat al-Nusra checkpoints. While there, he discovered he had been recommended by the Syrian Ministry of Agriculture.\n\n\"It was funny that the ministry knew about us and was handing over responsibility for the zoo animals to us,\" he says. \"The Magic World Zoo gave me a lot of headaches.\"\n\nAlaa was eventually able to negotiate a solution for the animals with a charity called Four Paws, which arranged for the animals that hadn't died to be transported out of Syria to new homes in Belgium, the Netherlands and Jordan.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption One of the rescued tigers, in transit through Turkey\n\nIn the new sanctuary he looks after 105 children, of whom 85 are \"orphans\" (in Syria the word covers children who have lost a breadwinner, as well as those who have lost both parents). Only 11 children actually sleep in the orphanage at present, because it isn't finished, but all receive education, food and clothes, for which Alaa pays 25 euros per month.\n\nThe biggest risk is the instability in the region. Clashes break out periodically, as it's close to the border with Idlib province, which is controlled by rebel groups who often fight each other. No-one knows what will happen next to that part of Syria and who will end up in charge.\n\n\"I blame all fighting parties equally - no matter who they are or why they say they're fighting - for the killing of civilians,\" Alaa says.\n\n\"We are rebuilding our communities and my role in that is to rebuild my sanctuary for cats. Friendship between animals is a great thing and we should learn from them. I'll stay with them no matter what happens.\n\n\"It seems the world cannot solve wars and conflicts these days. That's why there are now so many refugees around the world, but especially here in the Middle East.\n\n\"I do not want to be a refugee. I want to stay in my country, in Syria. I want to help people in any way I can.\"\n\nDiana Darke is the author, with Alaa Aljaleel, of The Last Sanctuary in Aleppo.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nImage copyright Lisa Mann\n\nLots of people love the birds in their garden, but it's rare for that affection to be reciprocated.

    "authors": [
      "Kelly Grovier"
    ],
    "text": "By the early 1970s, Victor Vasarely was everywhere. Regarded by historians today as the \u2018grandfather\u2019 of Op Art, the Hungarian-French abstract artist, then in his late sixties, had watched his pioneering geometric designs and hypnotising optical illusions come to represent his generation. Vasarely\u2019s carefully calibrated patterns of bright squares and luminous circles, which make his paintings\u2019 surfaces appear like warping space-time webs \u2013 now rippling and concave, now spinning and convex \u2013 was the hottest of hot demands.\n\nRenault, the automobile manufacturer, hired him to redesign the company\u2019s famous logo. David Bowie hired him to create the cover art for his album Space Oddity. Most, however, simply plagiarised the poetic physics of Vasarely\u2019s elegant grilles and melting lattices, desperate to tap into the futuristic wonder of their sleek style, without paying him a cent or acknowledging their debt.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- One of art\u2019s most enduring puzzles?\n\n- The puerile joke hidden in a 16th-Century painting\n\n- Unsettling images twisted from Disney\n\nA major exhibition devoted to Vasarely, now on at Centre Pompidou in Paris, has assembled more than 300 paintings, drawings and Pop Art objects that map his long career as a tireless innovator of 20th-Century abstract art. Among the dizzying inventory of images collected for the show is a formative ink-on-paper work that stands out as pivotal to the growth of one of the most under-appreciated imaginations in modern cultural history. Created in 1938, when Vasarely was still earning his stripes as a jobbing graphic designer in Paris (having finished art school at the Bauhaus-inspired Muhely Academy in Budapest a decade earlier), the deceptively simple monochrome work belongs to a series of studies devoted to the muscular movement and mesmerising markings of the African equid.\n\nWeaving and unweaving the beast\u2019s black-and-white stripes, the transfixing depiction of a pair of wrangling zebras strobes strangely before our eyes. The wild, striated sinews of the tussling pair in Zebres-A (1938) appear to pulsate and quiver, as if alternately kicking outwards towards the observer, beyond the image\u2019s surface, and recoiling into the invisible absence of the empty white field from which they\u2019ve miraculously emerged. The tangle of flexing lines is almost kinetic in the fluid, fluctuating movement it magicks from the simplest and sparest of pen-and-ink gestures.\n\nAdding to the dislocating effect of Vasarely\u2019s carefully controlled chaos is the sheer surprise of seeing zebras in a work of art in the first place. In the Noah\u2019s ark of art history, it\u2019s the horse \u2013 the zebra\u2019s zoological cousin \u2013 that has conventionally commanded our attention, trotted out on the walls of museums and galleries. The horse, of course, runs right through the long saga of image-making from the Stone Age to the present. From the prehistoric charcoal broncos that gallop across the crude interior of the Lascaux caves to the countless stallions stitched into the Bayeux Tapestry; from the steed in Jacques-Louis David\u2019s Napoleon Crossing the Alps to the tortured neigh that whinnies at the centre of Picasso\u2019s Guernica, horses have reigned supreme in cultural consciousness. (And that\u2019s not even mentioning the stampede of George Stubbses out there). Zebras? Not so much, despite the fact that they, more than any animal, seem half-drawn into the real world of fully filled-in colour \u2013 suspended midway between the India ink of an artist\u2019s draughting table and the blinding hues and havering heat of a mirage-soaked savannah.\n\nIn Vasarely\u2019s zebra portraits, the distinctive markings of the animal are transformed from something physical and empirical \u2013 pigment and hide \u2013 to mysterious metaphors for an almost transcendental phenomenon: the merging of the mind of the observer with the impalpable spirit of the natural world. They seem more like a sophisticated meditation on how the eye stalks the ever-elusive object of its gaze, rather than an attempt to chronicle the animal\u2019s magnetic mien.\n\nI can\u2019t help wondering whether the artist may have been influenced by experiments in camouflaging warships with markings inspired by the zebra\n\nI can\u2019t help wondering whether the artist may have been influenced, knowingly or otherwise, by experiments undertaken by maritime designers in the US and the UK admiralties during the first and second world wars, camouflaging their warships with markings inspired by the zebra. Believing that zebras may have evolved their distinctive stripes as a defence against predation (allegedly making it difficult for predators to isolate a single target or to assess the depth of field in which their prey moved), the British artist Norman Wilkinson proposed cloaking vessels in a jumble of angular black-and-white striations to confuse adversaries. So-called \u2018razzle-dazzle\u2019 wasn\u2019t intended to render a ship physically imperceptible, but merely to jam the senses of the approaching enemy.\n\nStripes and stars\n\nTracing the growth of Vasarely\u2019s imagination as it emerges over the course of the hundreds of works assembled into seven rooms of this vast exhibition, one increasingly appreciates what a game-changing revelation the dazzling hide of the zebras clearly was for the artist. Earlier figurative works of soulless, mannequin-like automatons inhabiting vacated cityscapes seem static by comparison, and show the young artist foraging around in the borrowed language of surrealism and constructivism for something authentic to his own way of seeing.\n\nEvery work by Vasarely that follows on from the zebra breakthrough seems inflected by that muscular epiphany. During the war years and after, Vasarely found himself ineluctably drawn in the direction that his hypnotic zebras were pulling \u2013 obsessed with scientific literature and ground-breaking optical theories. He found himself attempting to sync his vision with every undulation observable in the world around him, whether natural or manmade.\n\nIn an effort to perceive an invisible architecture that underlies reality, he began scrutinising everything from the motion of the tides to the organic pattern of cracks and fissures in subway tiles. The result was a series of monochromatic works created throughout the 1940s and \u201850s that are very much in accord with the spiritual temperament of his better-known contemporaries such as Arshile Gorky, Piet Mondrian and the Swedish mystic Hilma af Klint, whose secretive work \u2013 hidden from public view during these decades \u2013 is itself now undergoing a major revival.\n\nIn Hommage \u00e0 Mal\u00e9vitch (1954-58), it is as if Vasarely has taken the Russian avant-garde artist\u2019s famous Black Square (1915), which Malevich himself believed embodied the \u2018spirit of non-objective feeling\u2026 which penetrates everything\u2019, and tied that legendary canvas to the twisting tendons of a zebra\u2019s fierce physique, tugging it out of all proportion. The melting chessboard of Vasarely\u2019s elastic oil-on-canvas painting Vega (1956), created around the same time as Hommage \u00e0 Mal\u00e9vitch, seems likewise committed not so much to measuring the weight and substance of what we actually perceive in the world around us, but, paradoxically, to offering a glimpse into the unseeable forces and gravities that twist and distort our perception. Here, it feels like the memory of the zebra\u2019s stretching and contracting stripes has been fed through a digitising scanner or the pixelating mince of a particle collider in order to decrypt the binary code of its aesthetic essence.\n\nBy the 1960s, Vasarely had hit his stride in establishing what he believed were the archetypal gestures of a universal language, one that was fully in harmony with the brave new scientific discoveries of his age \u2013 \u201cworlds which\u201d, he would write, \u201cup until now, have escaped the investigation of the senses: the world of biochemistry, waves, fields, relativity\u201d. Vibrant colour, which he had used relatively sparingly in the years since depicting his first zebra, begin to seep back into the artist\u2019s work as a new generation of artists such as Bridget Riley, whose own engrossing lines strummed in tune with his, helped give his innovative vision corroborating traction.\n\nHowever increasingly complex the algorithms that generated works such as Vonal Zold (1968) and Szem (1970) may initially seem, the verve of their pulsing vortices and the rhythm of their thrumming music can be traced back, decades earlier, to the bold prance and dance of zebra stripes that caught the artist\u2019s soul off guard, and trampled it into genius.\n\nVictor Vasarely is at the Pompidou Centre in Paris until May 2019.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "authors": [

    ],
    "text": "The fragrance of thousands of incense sticks wafted through the narrow shopfront of the Wing Lee Joss Sticks & Sandalwood Company, a traditional family business in the Hong Kong neighbourhood of Yau Ma Tei. The walls were lined with bright gold-and-scarlet incense packs, but tucked away in glass cabinets was the most prized incense of all: agarwood.\n\nThe pungent, earthy scent of this wood gave Hong Kong its name, which, in Cantonese, translates as Fragrant Harbour. The scent is a poignant reminder of how this former colonial trading port, now a world financial hub, once played a pivotal role in the ancient incense trade to the Middle East and beyond.\n\nAt 84, Yuen Wah has worked in the incense business for more than 70 years. His son Kenny, who now runs Wing Lee, has expanded the business into Mainland China, adding shops in Beijing, Shanghai and Harbin. Although he\u2019s retired, Wah still visits his former shop on Shanghai Street.\n\n\u201cAgarwood was always an expensive timber,\u201d Wah told me, recalling the time when he started work in the industry at 13 years old. \u201cIn the past, it was used in medicine as it was a very good painkiller. Now it\u2019s gone from a medical use to being used as incense.\u201d\n\nAgarwood is created when Aquilaria trees, which were traditionally planted around villages for their Feng Shui properties, are damaged, allowing a mould to attack the timber. When harvested, the infected, dark, resinous wood is pared away from the healthy, scentless, cream-coloured wood.\n\nAnd it\u2019s this precious resin that has long been sought after. Known as the \u2018King of Incense\u2019, agarwood was extensively traded in the Middle East and Asia. Records from China\u2019s Tang and Song Dynasties show it was a highly valued commodity, and its heady scent has historical connections stretching across Buddhism, Taoism, Islam and Christianity.\n\nToday, smaller sections of agarwood resin are harvested for incense chips, selling for around HK$58,000 per kilogram in 2014. Larger logs, up to several metres in size, are sold as hand-carved sculptures \u2013 one shaped like the base and trunk of a tree in Wing Lee had a HK$1.2 million price tag. \u201cThese are like artworks,\u201d Wah said.\n\nThe resin is especially coveted for its use in perfume and incense. Agarwood resin is distilled to create Oud oil, which is an essential ingredient in high-end perfumes such as Armani Priv\u00e9\u2019s Oud Royal and Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s M7 Oud Absolu. Oud has been priced at nearly HK$300,000 per kilogram \u2013 it\u2019s so expensive it\u2019s often described as \u2018liquid gold\u2019.\n\nBut the huge demand for agarwood over the past few decades has resulted in Hong Kong\u2019s Aquilaria species teetering on the threshold of extinction.\n\nAsia Plantation Capital (APC), one of Asia\u2019s largest commercial Aquilaria growers, is trying to save the trees by encouraging sustainable agarwood plantations in Hong Kong and across Asia. They believe that only a few hundred wild specimens remain in Hong Kong, although the Hong Kong government claims to have planted around 10,000 saplings a year since 2009.\n\nBut simply planting saplings is no guarantee of survival as the trees take years to mature. And the current mature population is under even more threat due to poachers.\n\n\u201cPoachers look for older trees that are naturally infected, as they have more value, so these trees will increasingly be threatened,\u201d said Gerard McGuirk, APC\u2019s sales director in Hong Kong. \u201cNow in Hong Kong, you\u2019d be lucky to find a tree that\u2019s 30 years of age.\u201d\n\nWhile the exact number of trees remaining in the wild may be in dispute, it\u2019s clear that serious poaching is taking place.\n\nNear the small village of Shing Ping, close to the border with Shenzhen, third-generation agarwood farmer Koon Wing Chan presides over a small plantation of around 6,000 trees. His is the only agarwood farmer in Hong Kong. And in an effort to sustain, preserve and market this endangered species, he has entered a joint venture with APC.\n\nTo highlight the plight of wild incense trees, APC offers guided tours of Chan\u2019s farm and several public parks that are home to clusters of Aquilaria trees. Close to Chan\u2019s plantation, in Pat Sin Len Country Park, the air is thick with the scent of agarwood emanating from trees that have been stripped to bare trunks. The work is crude, designed to damage rather than kill the tree.\n\n\u201cNot every tree will have resin, so thieves are gambling,\u201d Wah said. In the wild, only 7% of trees produce resin.\n\nIn the steamy, mosquito-laden undergrowth of the park, the distinct odour is a sure sign that poachers will get some reward for a risk that could result in up to 10 years of jail time. Should they find the precious resin, poachers can earn significant amounts of money selling it on the black market.\n\nOver the past two years, police and Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) personnel carried out 35 anti-poaching operations in poaching hot spots such as Sai Kung, Lantau Island and northern parts of the New Territories. Now, AFCD plans to trial remote electronic monitoring of trees and closed-circuit television in Tai PO Kau Nature Reserve on the west coast of the territory, as well as growing more seedlings at its Tai Tong Nursery near Yuen Long.\n\nPlanting more saplings in Hong Kong\u2019s country parks seems unlikely to stop opportunistic poaching, but growing investor interest in environmentally sustainable Agarwood plantations could well save Hong Kong\u2019s remaining incense trees from extinction.\n\n\u201cWe have Agarwood plantations in five countries and we strongly believe in holistic sustainability, investing in the communities we operate in to create positive social impact,\u201d Watts said.\n\n\u201cOur strategic partnership with Mr. Chan will help provide support and expertise required to develop long-term commercial opportunities in Hong Kong on a sustainable basis while also helping Mr. Chan produce Oud oil locally,\u201d he said.\n\nJoin over three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

    "authors": [],
    "text": "The results are revealed of a six-year medical trial into a new treatment for Parkinson\u2019s. Can it give hope to ten million Parkinson\u2019s sufferers worldwide?\n\nFilmed over six years this programme follows a group of volunteers with Parkinson\u2019s as they take part in a ground-breaking medical trial testing an experimental drug called GDNF. Forty two volunteers undergo complex brain surgery and months of drug infusions via a port embedded into the side of their skull. Can this clinical trial give hope to the estimated ten million affected by Parkinson\u2019s globally?\n\nIn the second episode, cameras continue to follow the lives of the Parkinson\u2019s sufferers who agreed to take part in an invasive clinical trial - testing a drug that could be the first to halt progression, or even reverse, their condition.\n\nThe surgery and infusions are medical firsts, offering a whole new way of delivering drugs to the brain. It leads to Pfizer, the world\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical company, investing in GDNF and the Bristol delivery system part-way through the trial.\n\nSo far, the volunteers have been split into two groups, with half receiving GDNF (glial-cell derived neurotrophic factor \u2013 a naturally occurring protein found in our brains) and half just a placebo. Delivered through a revolutionary port in the side of their heads, no one knows who is receiving the active drug in their monthly infusions.\n\nAssessments show significant improvement in some. But Tom Isaacs, 44, from Hertfordshire, who felt better at the end of episode one, now thinks he is 30% worse than he was before the trial. He hopes, along with others who feel they haven\u2019t improved, that he\u2019s been on the placebo.\n\nThere is renewed optimism at the half-way point of the trial as all the volunteers start receiving GDNF. 'It wasn\u2019t considered ethical to put people through brain surgery without ever giving them a chance to have the drug', explains trial leader, Dr Alan Whone.\n\nWe see some remarkable improvements. Darren Calder, 51, from Wiltshire, can put on his socks himself in the morning, for the first time in years. In Glasgow, 44-year old Bryn Williams\u2019 tremor completely disappears. In Cornwall, Kay Cotton, 58, feels like she\u2019s been cured. But for Tom Isaacs and his wife Lyndsey, the trial proves a physical and emotional rollercoaster. Tom suffers ongoing complications following further brain surgery to replace his device (including a new titanium port on the other side of his head) but his indomitable spirit continues to inspire\n\nthe medical team.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, it\u2019s time for the trial\u2019s principal investigator neurologist Dr Alan Whone to reveal the much-anticipated results. Will the trial volunteers\u2019 experiences of the drug as potentially life-changing be borne out by the scientific results? And could this ambitious medical trial finally offer the hope of a cure for Parkinson\u2019s?"

    "text": "Half a millennia ago, forests covered much of the Iberian peninsula. But that soon changed. Centuries of wars and invasions, agricultural expansion and woodcutting for charcoal and shipping wiped out most of the woods and transformed places like Matamorisca, a small village in northern Spain, into degraded landscapes.\n\nThe region\u2019s arid climate and depleted soils would be a recipe for disaster in your average reforestation program, but for the Amsterdam-based Land Life Company it\u2019s an ideal place. \u201cWe typically operate where nature does not come back by itself,\u201d says Jurrian Ruys, its CEO. \u201cWe go where there are rougher conditions in terms of weather, with rough or very hot summers.\u201d\n\nIn Matamorisca, they intervened in 17 barren hectares owned by the regional government and peppered them with their signature device: a biodegradable cardboard donut they call the cocoon which can hold 25 litres of water underground to aid a seedling\u2019s first year. Around 16,000 oaks, ashes, walnuts, rowans, and whitebeams were planted in May 2018, and the company reports that 96% of them survived that year\u2019s scorching summer without extra irrigation, a critical milestone for a young tree.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u201cDoes nature return by itself?\u201d asks Arnout Asjes, Land Life Company\u2019s chief technology officer, who oversees a mix of drone and satellite imagery, big data analysis, soil enhancement, QR tagging and site-specific tree configuration designs. \u201cProbably, but it can take decades or hundreds of years, so we are speeding things up.\u201d\n\nHis company belongs to a global movement of organisations trying to save degraded or deforested areas, ranging from exuberant tropical lowlands to arid hills in temperate regions. Spurred by global biodiversity loss and climate change, these groups are pushing the boundary of how to revive forest cover. \u201cIt\u2019s not a theoretical proposition,\u201d says Walter Vergara, a forest and climate specialist at the World Resources Institute (WRI). \u201cIt requires the right incentives, the right stakeholders, the right analysis and sufficient capital, but it can happen.\u201d\n\nHow these factors coalesce around a particular project \u2013 and whether saving razed woods is even possible \u2013 depends on what kind of ecosystem you have in mind. Secondary forests in the Amazon are different from Texas pines recovering after wildfires or the boreal timber woods that cover much of Sweden. Each provide different reasons for reforestation programs and each has particular needs.\n\nIn the arid conditions around Matamorisca and similar areas in Spain, Land Life Company worries about rapid desertification. As its focus is on restoring an ecosystem, it works with organisations that don\u2019t expect their money back.\n\nBy 2030, the goal is to reach 350 million hectares \u2013 20% more land than India\n\nWith around 600 hectares replanted around the world since 2015 and another 1,100 planned for this year, the company\u2019s drive fits into the Bonn Challenge, a global effort to restore 150 million hectares of the world\u2019s deforested and degraded land by 2020. That\u2019s an area roughly the size of Iran or Mongolia. By 2030, the goal is to reach 350 million hectares \u2013 20% more land than India.\n\nThese targets include both the rehabilitation of forested areas that have lost density or look a bit weak (a process known as \u2018restoration\u2019 in forestry lingo) and the recuperation of forest cover in areas where it was completely cleared (what\u2019s known as \u2018reforestation\u2019).\n\nThat global target is broken into smaller pieces and takes shape in Latin America as the 20x20 Initiative, an effort to contribute 20 million hectares to the overall goal by catalysing small to medium projects with the political backing of governments.\n\nUnlike Land Life Company, this region-wide project makes the economic and business case for reforestation, even though they are after biodiversity conservation. \u201cYou need to bring private sector money,\u201d says WRI\u2019s Vergara, who leads the initiative, \u201cand that capital needs to see a return on their investment.\u201d A study he led predicts Latin America would see an estimated net present value of about $23bn (\u00a317.3bn) over a 50-year period if it reaches its goal.\n\nMoney can come from timber sales in sustainably managed forests or from harvesting \u2018non-wood products\u2019 like nuts, oils and fruits from the trees. You can take note of how much carbon dioxide your forest is capturing and sell carbon credits to companies keen to offset their emissions. Or you can even grow the forest hoping that biodiversity will attract ecotourists who\u2019d pay for lodging, birdwatching tours and meals.\n\nStill, these backers are not your high-street bank. Money for the 20x20 Initiative comes mostly from financial organisations with triple goals \u2013 a modest return on their investment, environmental benefits and social gains \u2013 known as impact investors.\n\nTake the German fund 12Tree for instance, one of the 20x20 partners. It put $9.5m (\u00a37.1m) into Cuango, a 1,455-hectare property on the Caribbean coast of Panama that combines a commercial cocoa plantation with timber extraction from a sustainably managed secondary forest. With their money, they reforested a former cattle ranch, provided high-quality jobs for the surrounding communities and made a return on their investment.\n\nBy reintroducing trees in the landscape, we impact positively humidity, rain capture, soil conservation and biodiversity preservation - Beno\u00eet Bertrand\n\nEven on land cleared decades ago and currently used by farmers, some crops can coexist with the forest, if you find the right balance. Although not technically reforestation, agroforestry provides an opportunity for small-holder farmers to sustain their livelihoods while adding some forest cover to their farms.\n\nA global project called Breedcafs is studying how trees behave in coffee farms, hoping to find crop varieties that manage to grow under the canopy shade. Coffee grows naturally in such forests, so replicating that in farms is taking the crop back to its roots.\n\n\u201cBy reintroducing trees in the landscape, we impact positively humidity, rain capture, soil conservation and biodiversity preservation,\u201d says coffee expert Beno\u00eet Bertrand, who leads the project from the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (Cirad). Bertrand is analysing which of dozens of coffee varieties fits better for this system. A similar approach can be applied to land with cocoa, vanilla and fruit trees.\n\nNot every piece of land is amenable for reforestation. Vergara\u2019s partners look for safe investments, and even Land Life Company only runs major projects in what they consider \u201clow-risk\u201d countries, like Spain, Mexico or the US. \u201cWe tend to avoid large-scale operations in countries in some parts of the Middle East or Africa where the permanence is not secured,\u201d says Ruys.\n\nBut in the right location, perhaps all you need is time. In the Central Pacific of Costa Rica, the 330-hectare National Wildlife Refuge Bar\u00fa looks nothing like the cattle ranch it was before 1987, when Jack Ewing decided to turn this hacienda into an ecotourism destination. Instead of intervening, a friend told him to let nature have its way.\n\nBar\u00fa\u2019s former grazing lands are now exuberant woods and the property boasts over 150 hectares of secondary forests with no intervention from humans. In the past 10 years, howling monkeys, scarlet macaws and even migratory cougars have returned to the refuge\u2019s land, boosting tourism and reinvigorating the ecosystem. Ewing, now 75, explains this success using the words his friend chose three decades ago: \u201cIn Costa Rica, when you stop managing the scrubs, the jungle comes back for its vengeance.\u201d\n\n--\n\nDiego Arguedas Ortiz is a science and climate change reporter for BBC Future.

    "title": "The yum cha rules you need to know",
    "authors": [
      "Karen Chiang"
    ],
    "text": "As a born and bred Hong-Konger, going to yum cha with my family every Sunday is an important tradition that has lasted many generations. Here, stories old and new are recounted over a table full of bamboo baskets that hold a variety of dim sum \u2013 small bites that encompass everything from delicately translucent prawn dumplings and silky rice rolls to molten lava custard buns and sweet roasted pork buns.\n\nLiterally meaning \u2018drink tea\u2019 in Cantonese, yum cha is as common a meal in Hong Kong as coffee and toast in Western culture, where Chinese tea is enjoyed with dim sum at traditional tea houses. Dating back to ancient China, teahouses have long been a place of rest and conversations for the common people.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 How to drink vodka like a Russian\n\n\u2022 Japan\u2019s mysterious moving meal\n\n\u2022 The dessert you can\u2019t make alone\n\nAfter World War Two, new immigrants from China brought yum cha culture with them, often becoming a regular routine between family and friends, and still now it remains an important part of Hong Kong society. Though it is a Cantonese cuisine originating from China\u2019s Guangdong province, Hong Kong remains one of the best places in the world for authentic yum cha food and atmosphere.\n\nYum cha is a group activity that involves everyone around the table. As it\u2019s centred on sharing, there are certain things to bear in mind when you\u2019re being served or serving others. My grandmother, the eldest in our weekly yum cha gathering, has always been quick to straighten out everyone\u2019s table manners. A few rules that she frequently mentions include finishing the last grain of rice in the bowl so a future spouse\u2019s skin will resemble the smoothness of the clean bowl; and to never stick chopsticks straight down into a bowl of rice because it resembles incense for the dead and will bring bad luck. She also reminds us to never bang our chopsticks on the bowl for fun because that was what beggars used to do for attention and is thus believed to bring poverty to the family.\n\nTo the uninitiated, these rules may seem random. But they are etiquettes that have been passed down from one generation to another through anecdotes that trace all the way back to ancient China.\n\nOne of my favourite examples relates to flying elephants. In Chinese chess, or Xiangqi, the two opposing sides are divided by a river, and the goal of the game is to move across the board and capture your opponent\u2019s king piece. As a rule, the pieces labelled elephant or xiang play a defensive role and are not allowed to cross the river into the opponent\u2019s side.\n\nJust like the elephants in Chinese chess, I was taught from a young age that at the yum cha table you are not supposed to \u2018cross the river\u2019 and go beyond your reach for dishes that are placed further away or in front of someone sitting opposite you. It is considered rude and undesirable behaviour at the table. Instead you should wait until the dish is placed in front of you or ask someone to pass it. That is also why, whenever I did occasionally forget the rule, my grandmother would tell me not to \u2018\u98db\u8c61\u904e\u6cb3\u2019, the neat four words that describe an elephant flying across the river and a reminder to stay within my reach.\n\nWhile my family and I enjoy a few rounds of dim sum and catch up on stories from the past week, Chinese tea makes for the perfect drink to sip on and help cut through the oiliness of the food. To begin every meal, the task falls on me, the younger generation, to order and serve the Pu-erh tea my family likes, then make sure everybody\u2019s cups are filled throughout the meal. My grandmother, who has spent many years working at a local teahouse, will knock on the table as a way of signalling thanks to the person who poured her drink. And the story behind this is one that many locals, including myself, will have heard many times before.\n\nAccording to legend, Emperor Qianlong of the Qing dynasty once visited a town in China dressed as a civilian, accompanied by several staff as security. The group decided to go to a teahouse to yum cha, and the emperor took a teapot and poured his staff some tea. The staff were terrified, but could not kneel to thank the emperor for fear of breaking his cover. Instead, they had a lightbulb moment, and knocked on the table three times with three fingers curled to signify kneeling three times as gratitude.\n\nSince then, the ritual has been well noted in modern literature, such as in Kung Fu Tea Dialogue (\u529f\u592b\u8336\u8a71) by Cao Peng, as a way to thank someone during yum cha without interrupting the conversation or talking with a full mouth. Cao also noted that the gesture means both saying yes to more tea, as well as gratitude.\n\nUnfortunately, the possibility of this story being historically accurate is rather low, according Dr Siu Yan-ho, a lecturer in the Department of Chinese at Hong Kong\u2019s Lingnan University.\n\n\u201cThe chance of the Qianlong Emperor visiting the society in civilian clothing was not high. The official diary of the emperor, as well as other related historic records in the era, are considered very well preserved, but there is currently no record of him doing such a thing,\u201d he explained.\n\nHowever, an alternative source for the tradition comes from Xu Jie-Xun in his book Han Dynasty\u2019s Folk Customs (\u6c49\u65cf\u6c11\u95f4\u98ce\u4fd7). He explains that during banquets in the Tang and Song Dynasties, guests had to sing a song for each round of drinks while the listeners created a beat for the singer. Without proper percussion instruments on hand, people would instead knock their fingers on the table, known in Chinese as ji-jie (\u64ca\u7bc0). Although the custom of singing at banquets has faded away, knocking on wood has become a sign of thanks and encouragement used now solely for tea-pouring. The meaning of the Chinese term ji-jie also transformed from \u2018creating a beat\u2019 into \u2018knocking on the table\u2019.\n\nThere are different ways to knock, depending on your relationship with the person pouring the tea. To elders, you should knock with a closed fist, to symbolise prostration and admiration. Between people of the same generation, knock with your index and middle fingers, much like cupping one fist as a sign of respect. Towards younger people, as my grandmother would do to me, just a single finger rap is needed as a nod of thanks.\n\nWe drink so much tea that we usually need to refill the single teapot on the table every half hour or so. Whenever we need the wait staff to top up the pots with hot water, we know to leave the lid of the teapot open and the lid balanced on the handle as a cue. This move is done for the wait staff\u2019s sake, so they don\u2019t have to check on the pots or be waved down \u2013 but what started this is said to be far more than just convenience.\n\nAccording to Siu, the origin legend has been long passed down through Chinese families as a fun anecdote. \u201cThe story goes, back in the late Qing Dynasty, there was a man who was the nephew of a powerful palace, and who was often avoided by civilians in fear of being bullied,\u201d Siu explained. \u201cOne day, he went to a teahouse after a big loss at the bird-fighting ring, and decided to set up a scam to get his money back. He took an empty tea pot and placed his bird into it. The waiter came to fill up the pot, but once he opened the lid, the bird escaped and flew away. The man then began to throw a fit, demanding compensation. Luckily, a martial arts master intervened and dissolved the situation, but ever since that day, the teahouse owner made a rule that customers must open the teapot lid to show that it needs filling up.\u201d\n\nAnother version was told to me by Mr Lam, who works at iconic teahouse Lin Heung Kui in Sheung Wan, in which the scalding tea killed the rich man\u2019s bird in the tea pot, hence the rule to avoid future compensation. Thus began this tradition of a silent symbol, gladly adopted by the industry and diners alike, and passed down through generations for the sake of first transparency, then efficiency.\n\nNowadays, hot water in insulated pots is usually available on each table so that diners can top up the tea pots themselves. But even now during our weekly yum cha sessions, my family will still leave the lid balanced on the handle of an empty tea pot, even as we refill the tea pot ourselves, and continue to teach younger family members the stories behind the table manners and rules.\n\nSo next time you\u2019re heading to yum cha in Hong Kong, be sure to knock on wood as a sign of thanks to the tea-pourer, think of the flying elephant before reaching for food, and ask a local about the many fun tales of Chinese table manners.\n\nThe Ritual of Eating is a BBC Travel series that explores interesting culinary rituals and food etiquette around the world.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

    "text": "Tom Rob Smith is the writer of novels including 'Child 44' and the screenwriter of London Spy and American Crime Story - The Assassination of Gianni Versace (Emmy nomination and winner at the Writers' Guild of America Awards). His new drama MotherFatherSon starring Richard Gere, Helen McCrory and Billy Howle begins on BBC Two on Wednesday 6th March 2019 at 9pm and on BBC iPlayer. We caught up with Tom to find out more about MotherFatherSon and his writing life.\n\nYou must enable javascript to play content Watch the trailer for MotherFatherSon\n\nAs well as the big themes of the drama around power, politics and the media, what subjects does it deal with on a more human scale? Why are these important to you? This is a story about a young man who suffers a catastrophic stroke and has to learn how to live again. In addition to the practical challenges of learning how to walk and talk again, we explore the question - if we had to start again, would we try to be the same person, or would we try to be someone else? In MotherFatherSon we're watching one of the most powerful young men in the country reduced to the level of a child, needing help to do even the most basic tasks. His parents played by Richard Gere and Helen McCrory become parents again, in that most basic and elemental sense. The son, played by a miraculous young actor called Billy Howle, is forced to reexamine every aspect of his life - from his relationships, to his career, to his very sense of self. It's a deeply emotional journey, one I witnessed when my close friend suffered a stroke.\n\nMax (RICHARD GERE), Caden (BILLY HOWLE) in MotherFatherSon (Image Credit: BBC/Laurence Cendrowicz)\n\nThe cast of MotherFatherSon is extraordinary. Did you know this when you were writing it? I agree, the cast is extraordinary - across the board, in every role, a huge part of that is down to the casting director, Julie Harkin, one of the best in the country. We hand the cast five page scenes and step back and allow them to take control, creating their own energy and rhythm, some of which remains entirely untouched in the final cut of the episodes. These scripts would be nothing without the cast. But no, I had no idea who we'd end up with, I just knew that if I wrote something that was entirely actor dependent, we'd find great people who'd want that challenge. It's not a surprise to me that so many of our cast, like Helen McCrory, have done so much astounding work in the theatre. And I think Richard Gere wanted to do those kinds of scenes too - he performs a two page monologue in episode two, and he's spellbinding, it's a masterclass. And Billy Howle is utterly fearless. So you'll be seeing some very famous actors while also discovering the next generation of acting superstars.\n\nMax (RICHARD GERE), Lauren (PIPPA BENNETT-WARNER)(Image Credit: BBC/Laurence Cendrowicz)\n\nIt\u2019s a huge undertaking to write 8 hours of television. How do you plan out the whole story structure? American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace was nine hours, so this felt relatively achievable, particularly since we didn't start filming until five scripts were finished. We started filming on Versace with just three scripts completed. That process was so intense, but anyway, the point is, the process on MotherFatherSon felt relatively calm in comparison. I always knew the end points, for all the characters, they were always very clear, and I knew that each episode had to feel special, like a mini movie, so each episode has its own core. A lot of the planning was in my head. Here at BBC Writersroom we notice that writers sometimes find it hard to move from theatre onto the big ideas and the size of the canvas needed to sustain a multi-episode TV series. Do you think your background as a novelist has helped with this? I guess, I'm not sure, it's always amazing to me how much you can do with sixty pages, it's a vast canvas, so holding that in mind is very important, it doesn't mean you need to be epic in scale, but you need to have enormously complex and powerful characters if you don't have that scale.\n\nKathryn (HELEN McCRORY)(Image Credit: BBC/Ollie Upton)\n\nDo you think you could ever work as a showrunner, leading a writers\u2019 room? Writer's rooms are complex places - the politics, the way work is divided up, they're supposed to make the task of writing eight or ten episodes easier, but they can often make it much more difficult. It helps if the writers all know each other and trust each other, that short cuts the process. I certainly wouldn't rule it out, that is how the system in the States tends to work. Do you have a writing regime? I start early, at about six, and finish by about two. I can rewrite in the evening, or watch cuts, but I can't write new material. I need to go for a walk at about two, it's important to get some distance from the words, and engage with the world. Do you ever find yourself blocked and if so then how do you deal with that? I've never had block exactly, I think I might have had a nervous breakdown once, and I don't mean that flippantly, but I wrote through it, writing was a way out.\n\nAngela (SARAH LANCASHIRE) (Image Credit: BBC/Laurence Cendrowicz)"

Well, that's up to you entirely.\n\nWhy do we eat pancakes?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nTurns out there's a pretty good reason.\n\nWhether you enjoy yours with lemon and sugar, American-style with bacon and maple syrup or French with a bit of chocolate spread and banana - the basis of the recipe is the same.\n\nEggs, flour and milk (if you're not sure how to make them, there's a recipe here).\n\nThose three key ingredients were once very common things to give up for Lent, so it made sense to use them all up in one handy dish the day before Lent started.\n\nThese days it's probably the toppings that we're more likely to scrap from our diet.\n\nWhy's it called Ash Wednesday?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Palm Sunday is the last Sunday of Lent\n\nAsh Wednesday marks the first day of Lent and comes straight after Shrove Tuesday.\n\nThe ashes that give the day its name are created from burnt palm leaf crosses from the previous year's Palm Sunday.\n\nThe ashes are then smeared on the heads of Christians during mass.\n\nWhere does Easter Sunday fit in?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nEaster Sunday this year falls on 1 April, the same day as April Fool's Day.\n\nEaster is not a set date but always falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon occurring on or after the spring equinox.\n\nThe equinox marks the first day of spring and is when the Earth's equator is directly inline with the centre of the sun.\n\nSo now you're all up-to-date, go make yourself a few pancakes as a treat.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here"

When he left the service in 2005, he was showing signs of Gulf War syndrome and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nA particularly horrific flashback in 2011 left Grandon unable to continue in his job as a physical therapist assistant and for two years he battled anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. \u201cEvery day I got up and I\u2019m like \u2018I wonder if it\u2019s going to be today\u2019,\u201d he says.\n\nBeekeeping saved Eric Grandon's life \u00a9 Supplied\n\nIn 2013, it was fellow veteran James McCormick, director of the Veterans and Warriors Agriculture program, who helped Grandon turn his life around. McCormick encouraged Grandon take up farming, which helped him with his own PTSD.\n\nAside from farming, Grandon was drawn to bees.\n\n\u201cOnce I got in the hive for the first time, that\u2019s when the magic happened. That\u2019s when I noticed the outside world went away. There was no intrusive thoughts, no anxiety, no depression.\u201d\n\nGrandon\u2019s new found peace of mind was put to the test when a natural catastrophe hit his colony and the hives were destroyed in a flood.\n\n\u201cThat was like losing everything. I mean, I had just found something to keep me on this side of the grass, and all of a sudden it was taken away from me.

    "text": "At a time of increased scrutiny about what constitutes sexual assault, award-winning documentary-maker Louis Theroux heads to American college campuses and comes face-to-face with students whose universities are accusing them of sexual assault.\n\nAs reports of sexual violence have dramatically increased in recent years, the government has urged US colleges to enforce a stricter code of sexual conduct amongst students. Employing specialist administrators to carry out investigations into alleged misdemeanors, they now have the power to permanently exclude those they deem \u2018responsible\u2019. For the victims of sexual assault these new processes, which require less stringent levels of proof than criminal cases, have allowed accusations that might have never been heard in a court of law to be vindicated. But alleged perpetrators believe the attempt to be more vigilant about rape and assault has turned into an overreaction that tramples on due process, and harms innocent people.\n\nAt the start of this journey, Louis meets a neuroscience major called Saif Khan, who has been accused of raping a fellow student. His university is investigating the claims separately even though Saif has been found not-guilty in a court of law. Though Saif continuously pleads his innocence, Louis is drawn into an increasingly complex world, where separating fact from fiction becomes increasingly challenging.\n\nHe also meets young women whose claims of sexual assault have previously fallen on deaf ears, who believe that a new approach to handling allegations of sex crimes is not only necessary but long overdue. One such student is Mollie Johnson, whose experience is a powerful reminder that there is now a broader understanding of what sexual assault looks like."

      "Stav Dimitropoulos"
    ],
    "text": "Giannis Bellonias was standing on the edge of a craggy cliffside in Imerovigli, a village built on the apex of Santorini\u2019s vertigo-inducing caldera, waiting for sunset from the infamous lookout known as the \u2018balcony to the Aegean\u2019.\n\n\u201cThere, right there! Look at the volcano,\u201d the Santorini local said to me, pointing to what are in fact two small, black lava islands created by volcanic activity (and are the most recently formed pieces of land in the Eastern Mediterranean basin), called Palea Kameni (Old Burnt) and Nea Kameni (Young Burnt).\n\nWith sun-bleached, blue-shuttered houses dotted among rocks, and alabaster paved paths meandering between them, Santorini is the archetypal Greek island fantasy, an envy-inducing sight on travel brochures and Instagram posts. But beneath the glittering facade, there is a dark secret to its seductive prowess.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 Europe\u2019s most endangered language?\n\n\u2022 The Greek word that can\u2019t be translated\n\n\u2022 The mystery behind Greece\u2019s temples\n\nSituated in the southern Aegean Sea, Santorini is a small, circular group of five Cycladic islands, made up of main island Thera; Therasia and Aspronisi at the periphery; and the two lava islands. All five surround a colossal, mostly drowned caldera, a bowl-shaped crater that forms when the mouth of a volcano collapses. But during the Bronze Age, approximately 5,000 years ago, Santorini was a single volcanic landmass called Stronghyle (which means \u2018round\u2019 in Greek), and one that played a crucial role in shaping history.\n\nAround that time, a civilisation started developing on the nearby island of Crete. The inhabitants were the Minoans, named for mythical King Minos, an enigmatic and educated people, who were warriors but also merchants, artists and seafarers. The Minoans\u2019 ancestry has been the subject of hot dispute: some believe they were refugees from Egypt's Nile Delta, while others say they hailed from ancient Palestine, Syria or North Mesopotamia. The most recent research says the Minoan civilisation was a local development, originated by early farmers who lived in Greece and south-western Anatolia. Whatever the case, there is little doubt that between 2600 and 1100BC a sublimely sophisticated and advanced civilisation thrived here. Excavations in Crete, especially in Knossos (the capital of Minoan Crete), have unearthed the remains of a spectacular palace, golden jewellery and elegant frescoes.\n\nOver the centuries, the Minoan empire extended over the island of Rhodes (309km east of Stronghyle) as well as parts of the Turkish coast and perhaps as far as Egypt and Syria. Stronghyle (now Santorini) was an especially important outpost for the Minoans due to its privileged position on the copper trade route between Cyprus and Minoan Crete.\n\n\u201cThe excavations in Akrotiri [a village in Santorini\u2019s south-west] have found three-storey houses, vast and elaborate palaces, Europe's first paved roads, running water and a spectacular sewage system,\u201d said Paraskevi Nomikou, assistant professor in geological oceanography and natural geography at the University of Athens.\n\nMost fascinating of all, Europe\u2019s first writing systems were found in buildings in Akrotiri and on the faces of Bronze Age rocks in the Cretan palaces of Knossos and Malia: it was here that the Minoans inscribed the first of their written words, initially in the form of Cretan Hieroglyphics and later in Linear A.\n\nCretan Hieroglyphs is an ancient script of around 137 pictorials that look like plants, animals, body parts, weapons, ships and other objects, and is believed to have been in use until 1700BC. Gradually, the Minoans refined Cretan Hieroglyphs down to the much more stylised Linear A, which took the linguistic helm until about 1450BC. Linear A had various numbers, 200 signs and also more than 70 syllable signs, making it more like language as we know it today (though both scripts remain undeciphered).\n\nRightfully, the creators of Europe\u2019s earliest written script have been hailed as the continent\u2019s first literate and advanced civilisation. And their intellectual achievements were only surpassed by their uninhibited way of living, celebrating the joy of life even at funerals, playing with bulls instead of killing them and living in blissful harmony with nature.\n\nAnd it was nature that finally decided to kill them.\n\nBetween 1627 and 1600 BCE, the Late Bronze Eruption (commonly called the Minoan or Santorini Eruption), perhaps the greatest eruption in 10,000 years, took place on Stronghyle.\n\nIt was nature that finally decided to kill them\n\n\u201cPrior to the eruption, the modern caldera did not exist. Instead a smaller caldera, from a much older eruption, formed a lagoon at the north of the island,\u201d Nomikou said. \u201cDuring the eruption, titanic flows of 60m-thick landslides of volcanic material fell onto the sea, triggering 9m-high tsunami waves that smashed onto the shores of Crete.\u201d\n\nThe waves may have reached western Turkey and even Israel.\n\nOnce the cataclysm ended, the modern caldera began to form (though conjuring into existence the modern Santorini would take several thousand years).\n\nFor the Minoans it was the beginning of the end. \u201cThe volcanic destruction decimated their commercial boats, and the huge amount of carbon dioxide that was released in the atmosphere disturbed the climate balance, destroying Minoan agriculture. All this gradually enabled the Mycenaeans [a Bronze Age civilisation that inhabited mainland Greece between 1600 and 1100 BCE] to seize their chance to put an end to Minoan independence.\u201d\n\nBut what startles Nomikou is that, unlike the ancient Roman town-city of Pompeii, which got buried in more than 6m of volcanic ash and pumice in the wake of Vesuvius in 79AD, no bodies have ever been found on Santorini.\n\n\u201cBy all appearances, the people of Santorini were warned in advance and escaped,\u201d she said. To this day, no-one knows where they went.\n\nBut if Santorini destroyed Europe\u2019s first great civilisation, it did not destroy language. Once the more-belligerent Mycenaeans ruled over the previous Minoan empire, they replaced Linear A with their own evolved version, Linear B, the first attested writing system of the Greeks, which eventually led to the Ancient Greek language that spread democracy, scientific reasoning, theatre and philosophy around the world.\n\nMore than 3,500 years after the mayhem, Bellonias is a proud owner of one of Santorini\u2019s traditional hillside cave settlements, carved straight into the volcanic caldera.\n\n\u201cThey are the perfect air-conditioned houses. In the winter, the volcano sends heat your way and in the summer it chills you,\u201d he said with a grin.\n\nBellonias, an art collector who owns a cultural foundation with a library housing 35,000 books (including hundreds dedicated to Santorini), has been living on and off the island for almost 60 years now, having spent his childhood and formative years in Athens.\n\nSantorini is not for the faint of heart\n\n\u201cIt may surprise you, but what dwells in my mind is that smell,\u201d he told me. \u201cEvery time we came to the island from Athens when I was a child \u2013 we arrived at dawn from Piraeus; the voyage was a hard labour back then \u2013 I was hit by the smell of cavallines,the excrement of the horses that hauled locals and tourists up to Imerovigli, before Santorini, well, caught on.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can still smell cavallines if you sacrifice the convenience of your car,\u201d he added, looking straight ahead at the volcanic islands, behind which fiery colours stretching from deep red to ultra-violet were brewing as the sun prepared to set.\n\n\u201cI have never been able to put these colours in words. I don\u2019t think anyone who has ever lived on this island has. They might be crimson, pink, orange, red, violet... I just can\u2019t put the sunset in words. For me it\u2019s a visceral feeling. Santorini is not for the faint of heart.\u201d\n\nAnd he\u2019s probably right; it did destroy Europe\u2019s first civilisation, after all.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

    "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Prodigy singer Keith Flint dies age 49\n\nThe Prodigy singer Keith Flint has died aged 49.\n\nInstantly recognisable by his fluorescent spiked hair and known for high-octane performances, Flint sang lead vocals on both the band's number one singles, Breathe and Firestarter.\n\nHe was found dead at his home in Dunmow, Essex, on Monday morning.\n\nThe band, who were due to tour the US in May, confirmed his death in a statement, remembering Flint as a \"true pioneer, innovator and legend\".\n\nIn a post on The Prodigy's official Instagram account, bandmate Liam Howlett added: \"I can't believe I'm saying this but our brother Keith took his own life over the weekend.\n\n\"I'm shell-shocked... angry, confused and heartbroken.\"\n\nIt emerged on Tuesday that Flint took part in a 5km park run in Chelmsford two days before his death.\n\nOrganisers of the run said he posted a personal best time of 21 minutes 22 seconds and said they \"wished he could have been part of our parkrun community for longer than he was\".\n\nFans and friends flooded Twitter with tributes as news of the death spread.\n\nThe Chemical Brothers' Ed Simons remembered him as \"a great man\" who was \"always great fun to be around\".\n\nBBC Radio 2 DJ Jo Whiley described Flint as \"an absolute sweetheart\" and \"iconic front man\". Dance duo Chase & Status said: \"We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Keith and the life-changing music they made and championed.\"\n\nAnd TV personality Gail Porter, who dated Flint in the late 1990s - when the three members of the Prodigy were all in relationships with poster girls of \"ladette culture\" - later tweeted the single word \"Heartbroken\".\n\nSinger James Blunt said The Prodigy star had showed him kindness when others in the industry did not.\n\nBlunt tweeted about an awards show \"years ago\" when, he said, some artists declined to be pictured with him, adding: \"Keith Flint came over, gave me a hug, and said how thrilled he was for my success.\"\n\nHe wrote: \"Keith, I only met you once, but I shed a tear at the news of your death. In our business, there are no prizes for being kind, but if there was, that Grammy would be yours.\"\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Keith Flint and Gail Porter walked hand-in-hand at the London premiere of Mad Cows, at the Odeon West End cinema, Leicester Square in 1999\n\nBorn Keith Charles Flint on 17 September 1969, the singer had an unhappy childhood in Braintree, Essex, feuding with his parents, who split when he was young.\n\nA bright boy with dyslexia, he was disruptive in class, and was thrown out of school at the age of 15.\n\nFinding work as a roofer, he immersed himself in the acid house scene of the late 80s - meeting Howlett at an open-air rave in 1989.\n\nImpressed by Howlett's DJ skills, he approached him and asked for a personalised mixtape. Howlett obliged, scoring the word \"Prodigy\" on the cover in reference to his favourite synthesiser and putting a selection of his original songs on the B-side.\n\nFlint was so impressed that he encouraged Howlett to pursue music professionally, offering up his services as a dancer.\n\n\"I loved his music and, 'Boom!' I was in,\" he told FHM magazine.\n\n\"I was never the brains behind the band - that was always Liam. But together we were a complete package. It was the outlet I was looking for.\"\n\nCompleted by Leeroy Thornhill, The Prodigy scored early hits with Everybody In The Place, Out Of Space and Charly - which sampled the dialogue from an old children's safety film: \"Always tell your mummy before you go off somewhere.\"\n\nTheir music matured on their second album, Music For The Jilted Generation, which introduced new band member MC Maxim and saw Howlett incorporate breakbeats, guitar loops and hip-hop samples on tracks such as No Good (Start The Dance) and Voodoo People.\n\nThe album was nominated for a Mercury Music Prize - but the band truly went global when Flint grabbed the mic and unleashed the full fury of his voice on the abrasive, in-your-face rave-rock anthem Firestarter.\n\nThe lyrics - \"I'm the firestarter / Twisted firestarter\" - were the first he'd written for the band.\n\n\"It didn't really have anything to do with starting fires,\" he told the BBC in 1996.\n\n\"It was when you're in front of 5,000 people and you can go out there - and just with the aid of the music and a visual performance, you can stir all them people up into a frenzy and that's almost like starting a massive fire, or a riot.\"\n\nFirestarter's black-and-white video, featuring a headbanging Flint in an abandoned Tube station, was blacklisted by the BBC after it was shown on Top of the Pops and parents complained it had frightened their children (a truncated version was shown subsequently).\n\nDespite that, it knocked Take That's How Deep Is Your Love off the top of the charts, in 1996, selling more than 600,000 copies in the UK alone.\n\nSpurred by its success, the band's third album, Fat of The Land, went to number one in both the US and UK, selling several million copies worldwide.\n\nFlint stepped up as a frontman, giving The Prodigy a focal point for their live shows - including a notable headline slot at the Glastonbury Festival in 1997.\n\nFestival organiser Emily Eavis called it a \"huge, unforgettable moment\" - paying tribute to Flint on Twitter following his death - and revealed that The Prodigy had been booked for this year's event.\n\nDrug problem\n\nFollowing the success of Fat of the Land, the band faltered.\n\nHowlett disowned the single Baby's Got A Temper, which included a controversial lyric about the \"date rape\" drug Rohypnol, while Flint recorded a largely forgotten solo album, Device #1, in 2003.\n\nWhile remaining part of the band, Flint did not feature on their 2004 album, Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned, on which vocal duties were handled by Liam and Noel Gallagher and actress Juliette Lewis, among others.\n\nDuring this period, Flint said he had had depression and formed a worrying dependence on prescription drugs.\n\n\"I'd line up rows of pills and just take them and take them and I'd lose track of how many until I passed out,\" he told The Times in 2009.\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption The band supported Oasis at their Knebworth gigs in 1996\n\nHe decided to get clean after meeting Japanese DJ Mayumi Kai, giving up drugs, cigarettes and alcohol around the time of their marriage, in 2006.\n\nThree years later, The Prodigy regrouped and returned to their classic sound, on the album Invaders Must Die.\n\nThe first single, Omen, was a major success, and the band returned to festival stages and stadiums around the world.\n\nTheir most recent album, No Tourists, went to number one last November.\n\nFlint was also a keen motorcyclist and had his own team - Team Traction Control - which has won four Isle Of Man TT races.\n\nHe had recently wrapped up a tour with The Prodigy in Australia and was due to join them in the US in May.\n\nIn a statement, Essex police said: \"We were called to concerns for the welfare of a man at an address in Brook Hill, North End, just after 08:10 on Monday, 4 March.\n\n\"We attended and, sadly, a 49-year-old man was pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin have been informed.\n\n\"The death is not being treated as suspicious and a file will be prepared for the coroner.\"\n\nFlint did not have any children.\n\nIf you are struggling to cope, please click on this link to access support services, including The Samaritans.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

    "text": "Which do you find easier to describe: the colour of grass, or its smell? The answer may depend on where you are from \u2013 and, more specifically, which language you grew up speaking.\n\nHumans are often characterised as visual beings. If you are a native English speaker, you may intuitively agree. After all, English has a rich vocabulary for colours and geometric shapes, but few words for smells. However, a recent global study suggests that whether we mainly experience the world by seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or feeling varies hugely across cultures. And this preference is reflected in our language.\n\nThe study was based on tests conducted by 26 researchers across 20 languages in Europe, North and South America, Asia, Africa and Australia, with locations ranging from big modern cities to remote indigenous villages. Participants were asked to describe so-called sensory stimulants, such as coloured paper, a sip of sugar water, or a sniff of a scented card.\n\nThe results suggest that our lifestyle, our environment and even the shape of our houses all can influence how we perceive things \u2013 and how easy (or not) we find it to put this perception into words.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 What is the best age to learn a language?\n\n\u2022 The words that change what colours we see\n\n\u2022 The hidden ways your language betrays your character\n\n\u201cI think we often think about language as giving us direct information about the world,\u201d says Asifa Majid, a professor of language, communication, and cultural cognition at the University of York, who led the research. \u201cYou can see that in how we think about the senses and how that\u2019s reflected in modern-day science.\u201d\n\nMajid says that many textbooks for example refer to humans as visual creatures.\n\n\u201cPart of the rationale for that has been the amount of brain that\u2019s devoted to vision versus smell, for example. But another piece of crucial evidence has been language. So often people say, well, look, there are just many more words to talk about things that we see, and we struggle to talk about things that we smell,\u201d she says.\n\nHowever, Majid says some societies are much more oriented towards smell or sound. Her own research on the Jahai, a community of hunter-gatherers in the Malay Peninsula, has recorded a vocabulary for smells as varied and precise as the English vocabulary for colours.\n\nThe study brought together specialists in languages as diverse as Umpila, spoken by only about 100 people in Australia, to English, spoken by about a billion people around the world. In total, 313 people were tested. The researchers gave them the different stimulants, and then measured each group\u2019s level of \u201ccodability\u201d \u2013 that is, the level of agreement among the responses in each group. A high level of codability means that a group has an agreed-upon way of talking about, say, certain colours. A low level of codability can indicate that the group does not have a shared, commonly accepted vocabulary for those colours, or that it is unable to identify them.\n\nEnglish speakers were best at talking about shapes and colours. They all agreed, for example, that something was a triangle, or green.\n\nSpeakers of Lao and Farsi, on the other hand, excelled at naming tastes. When offered bitter-flavoured water, all Farsi speakers in the study described it as \u201ctalkh\u201d, the Farsi word for bitter.\n\nThis was not the case with English speakers. When offered the same bitter-flavoured water, \u201cEnglish speakers said everything from bitter, to salty, sour, not bad, plain, mint, like ear wax, medicinal and so forth\u201d, says Majid.\n\nShe says this kind of taste confusion consistently happens to English speakers in lab tests: \u201cThey describe bitter as being salty and sour, they describe sour as being bitter, they describe salt as being sour. So even though we\u2019ve got the vocabulary, there seems to be some confusion in people\u2019s minds over how to map their taste experience onto language.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the language communities that had very high scores for the tasting task \u2013 Farsi, Lao and Cantonese \u2013 all have famously sophisticated cuisines that cultivate a range of different flavours, including bitterness.\n\nOther participants struggled with certain tasks because their language simply lacked words for what they were shown. Umpila, a language spoken by a hunter-gatherer community in Australia, only has words for black, white and red. However, Umpila speakers found it easiest to describe smells. This tendency towards smell rather than vision is found among hunter gatherers around the world, including the aforementioned Jahai. The reason may have to do with living and hunting in forests that are rich in smells.\n\nThe sensory diversity even held true across sign languages. Speakers of Kata Kolok, a village sign language spoken by about 1,200 people in Bali, struggled almost as much as the Umpila with describing colours. Speakers of American Sign Language and British Sign Language, on the other hand, found this task relatively easy, and scored about the same as English speakers.\n\nCultural factors from art to architecture appeared to play a role in how well participants performed across the different tests. People from communities that produced patterned pottery did better at talking about shapes. Those living in angular rather than round houses tended to be better at describing angular shapes. And participants from communities with specialist musicians were better at describing sounds \u2013 even though they were not musicians themselves.\n\n\u201cJust having specialist musicians means that that community develops a certain way of talking about sounds, and that everybody seems to have a better handle on how to talk about sounds,\u201d Majid says.\n\nFor those of us who spend more time in front of silent, odourless screens than among fragrant plants and jamming musicians, the study could be an encouragement to seek out new sensory experiences. But it is also a reminder of the value of linguistic diversity.\n\nUmpila, for example, is threatened by extinction. The number of native Umpila speakers is dwindling. And yet, when it comes to describing smells, this rare, endangered language apparently has the edge over booming, billion-strong English.\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Image copyright Samantha Chantarasak Image caption David Hockney and his knights in shining armour\n\nArtist David Hockney had to be rescued by firefighters after getting trapped in a hotel lift in Amsterdam on Wednesday. But he wasn't alone. Among those with him were the Daily Mail's editor and the BBC's James Naughtie, who shares the experience here.\n\nIt was all a bit unexpected. I suppose when you get stuck in a lift, it always is.\n\nWe were coming down in David Hockney's hotel next to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam so we could find a quiet spot for an interview.\n\nHe wanted to have a smoke outside: he usually does. A little crowd packed into the lift: a correspondent from the New York Times, a Dutch artist with a TV cameraman in tow, a few others. Nine of us. It jerked to a halt. There was a suspicious silence. We knew we were stuck.\n\nWe pressed the alarm a few times. Nothing. Nobody's mobile phone could get a signal. There was a bit of feeble shouting and we shuffled around, wondering if the lift would be tricked into moving again. But it only wobbled.\n\nWe didn't know whether we were in the basement, between floors, or whether we'd somehow gone up by mistake. Someone suggested pushing on the ceiling, because that's what happened in the movies when people climbed out by scrambling up the metal wires. Somehow, that didn't seem very realistic to us.\n\nEventually there were shouts from outside. Of all people, the editor of The Daily Mail, Geordie Greig, a very old friend of Hockney's, was waiting for us in the lobby... and we realised where we were.\n\nGeordie went into super boy scout mode and began to reassure us: the general manager of the hotel had been summoned, with his chief engineer. So had the Amsterdam fire department.\n\nBy this time, we'd prised the door open three inches and or so and we could see light. Someone started to pass bottles of water through the gap. Then Geordie got someone to find a folding stool that was slipped through so that Hockney - 81, after all - could sit down.\n\nI thought the community singing was going to start soon. People were making jokes, but realised that the fun would only last for so long.\n\n\"Get a crowbar,\" said Hockney (there was a pithy adjective attached).\n\nWe'd been there for getting on for half an hour. Then feet on the roof of the lift, the sound of clanking - some heavy tools were on the scene - lights from torches, the glimpse of a fireman's uniform. Much heaving and groaning.\n\nThe New York Times correspondent said she'd spent her whole life in that city - a place built on elevators - and this had never happened to her before. That wasn't much help.\n\nWe exchanged stories. I thought of Tony Hancock's sketch, from half a century ago, about what happened when a bunch of strangers got marooned in a lift. This seemed more like a Pinter play.\n\nI'm afraid I was worried most about whether after all this we'd get our interview.\n\nBut the cranking and heaving was helping. Eventually, with a creak and a bang, the door was wrenched back, light poured in, and we climbed out, to cheers from the crowd that had gathered in the lobby.\n\nIt hadn't been exactly life-threatening; more a bit of weird fun. Afterwards, the firemen crowded round. They wanted a picture with Hockney. It was Amsterdam, after all. A very civilised city.\n\nThe exhibition Hockney-Van Gogh: The Joy of Nature opens at the Van Gogh Museum on Friday.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

FFWRN MEICRODON (Foo-rhn May-kro-don)\n\nLet\u2019s get the myth out of the way now. \u201cPopty ping\u201d is not the Welsh term for the microwave oven, sorry. A literal translation would be \u201cthe oven that goes ping\u201d, which, while being very Pythonesque, and incredibly funny, isn\u2019t actually true. The Welsh word for microwave is \u201cmeicrodon\u201d \u2013 \u201cmeicro\u201d being Welsh for micro, and \u201cdon\u201d, the mutated word for ton (tohn), literally means wave. And \u201cffwrn\u201d just means oven. I know. Dull, isn\u2019t it?\n\nAnd on the same subject, the Welsh word for jellyfish is not \u201cpysgodyn wibli wobli\u201d (puh-skod-in wibbly wobbly), or, in English, wibbly wobbly fish. Lord alone knows what comedian came up with that one, but it\u2019s fairly new in the lexicon of non-existent Welsh words. For many years, the official Welsh term for the jellyfish was \u201ccont y m\u00f4r\u2019, academics have recently changed it to \u201csglefren f\u00f4r\u201d (skle-vren vore = sea skater).\n\n3. SBIGOGLYS (Sbee-Gog-Liss)\n\nThe Welsh have always been a creative bunch when it comes to naming fauna and flora, but there\u2019s a simple and joyous beauty to the word \u201csbigoglys\u201d as the translation for spinach. Whether it\u2019s the saag bhaji at your local Indian restaurant, or fine dining at 5-star establishments, the word \u201csbigoglys\u201d takes a lot of the pretentiousness out of the culinary environment. For dessert, you could also order yourself a peach melba in Welsh. Melba is just \u201cmelba\u201d, but the peach is known as the \u201ceirin gwlanog\u201d (ay-reen glan-og) \u2013 literally translated as woolly plums."

    ],
    "text": "Having customers order a \u2018toasted teacake\u2019 in the West Yorkshire sandwich shop where I worked as a teenager wasn\u2019t unusual, yet even this simple request always necessitated a follow-up question: \u2018plain or currant?\u2019.\n\nWhile to me a \u2018teacake\u2019 naturally implies a plain, savoury bread roll, most of the country outside West Yorkshire believes a teacake to be a sweet bread laden with plump currants. I\u2019d say, logically, that that should be known as a \u2018currant teacake\u2019, but what can you do?\n\nEveryone in the UK has an opinion on just what to call what is perhaps the most inoffensive foodstuff known to man \u2013 the humble, ubiquitous bread roll; round and savoury with soft, white innards and an often floury exterior.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 The Irish answer to French bread\n\n\u2022 The cake that comes with a warning\n\n\u2022 The pastry Mexico borrowed from Britain\n\nA study conducted by the University of Manchester identified seven terms used around the UK for the generic bread roll, mostly found in Northern England, or, in the case of \u2018bap\u2019, Scotland. Other variations are \u2018batch\u2019, which turned up with most regularity in Coventry and Liverpool; the Lancashire \u2018barm\u2019; and the West Yorkshire \u2018teacake\u2019. Oldham got in on the action with \u2018muffin\u2019, while \u2018bun\u2019 and \u2018cob\u2019 are more generally used in north-east England and the Midlands respectively.\n\nOther sources often throw even more intensely regional options into the mix, like north-east England\u2019s \u2018stottie\u2019, Lancashire\u2019s \u2018oven bottoms\u2019, and the Leeds-area \u2018scufflers\u2019 or \u2018breadcakes\u2019 (the aforementioned barm sometimes comes suffixed with \u2018cake\u2019, too) \u2013 although the true \u2018bread roll\u2019 legitimacy of some of these is hotly debated. Regardless, there are thought to be some 20 vocabulary variations on the neutral \u2018bread roll\u2019, with some more widely used and understood than others depending exactly where in the UK you find yourself.\n\nThere are thought to be some 20 vocabulary variations on the neutral \u2018bread roll\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder then that ordering anything involving a bread roll outside your bread-name bubble can be so confusing. For example, asking for that \u2018teacake\u2019 and not specifying \u2018currant\u2019 in my tiny West Yorkshire shop would have got you a satisfyingly warm and buttery bread roll, albeit sans fruit.\n\nAnd sometimes even the sandwich shop itself reflects the regional differences in doughy vocabulary. \u201cIf you go to Nottingham or Derby, then you don\u2019t go to a sandwich shop, you go to a cob shop,\u201d said Jonnie Robinson, dialectologist and lead curator of the British Library\u2019s Spoken Speech collection.\n\nYet our numerous words for the enduringly popular bread roll reflect more than opinion on the \u2018right way\u2019 to say things, instead reflecting \u201cgeographical barriers, political and cultural divisions and settlement history,\u201d according to Dr Laurel MacKenzie, linguist and coordinator of the aforementioned University of Manchester study.\n\nTake the Coventry \u2018batch\u2019, which comes from an old Germanic word meaning \u2018to bake\u2019 (\u2018bacan\u2019 in Old English). \u201cThis original meaning shifted from \u2018process of baking\u2019 to \u2018event of baking\u2019 to \u2018the set of things baked\u2019, and eventually from there got to \u2018set of things from one origin\u2019 and just \u2018set of things\u2019,\u201d explained Dr Tam Blaxter, a member of the faculty of Modern and Medieval Languages at Cambridge University. \u201cSo \u2018batch\u2019 meaning \u2018bread roll\u2019 is a different, localised development.\u201d Similarly, Lancashire\u2019s favoured word, \u2018barm\u2019 (meaning yeast) is probably descended from an old, native Germanic word, too.\n\nThen there are terms that reflect the influence of other languages on English. Of \u2018bap\u2019, used across northern stretches of the British Isles, particularly in Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and Scotland, Dr Blaxter admits its origins are a bit of a mystery. But while there\u2019s no known etymology, it is attested to be a Scots word. Meanwhile \u2018bara\u2019 is alleged to mean \u2018bread roll\u2019 in Wales; however, given that the Welsh word simply translates to \u2018bread\u2019, some suggest the bara-bread roll comparison all comes down to a simple mistranslation.\n\nDr Blaxter goes on to note that \u201cEnglish does stand out among languages in the degree to which we\u2019ve developed a culture of talking about \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018wrong\u2019 speech\u201d, which makes me think that our fierce debates about bread aren\u2019t really about bread; they\u2019re about identity. After all, the words we use says a lot about us, and what strikes me as a northerner is that when compared to the south, the northern regions of the UK seem to have greater diversity when it comes to these enduring regionalisms.\n\nOur fierce debates about bread aren\u2019t really about bread; they\u2019re about identity\n\nI asked Robinson, a fellow Yorkshire-person, whether we northerners simply have a stronger sense of regional identity than southerners. \u201cCertainly in a modern context, a lot of speakers in the south of England use a lot more \u2018standard\u2019 vocabulary than speakers in the north of England,\u201d he said.\n\nNot quite the overt \u2018yes\u2019 my northern pride was hoping for.\n\nInstead, Robinson explained, it all comes down to cities, or rather London\u2019s penchant for absorbing nearby cities both physically and influentially, thus making the south-east more linguistically homogenous, at least when it comes to bread rolls. In the north, on the other hand, urban sprawl is less common, allowing neighbouring urban hubs to flourish independently and helping preserve localised language variants. That explains why people from northern England predominantly plump for \u2018buns\u2019 or \u2018barm cakes\u2019, while in the south-east (especially London and the Home Counties), all you\u2019ll really hear is \u2018roll\u2019.\n\nAnd if it weren\u2019t already hard enough for both native and non-native speakers to navigate the yeasty nuance of British bread terms, further differentiations exist. Robinson notes that his Midlander mum would always make a distinction between a \u2018soft bap\u2019 and a \u2018crusty cob\u2019, even though they\u2019re both two of the most widely accepted, synonymous variations on the neutral \u2018bread roll\u2019. Then there are contextual variations in usage. \u201cFor some people the distinction is not just the word, it\u2019s the types of products. So, in the Leeds/Castleford area you get \u2018breadcakes\u2019 if they\u2019re round and \u2018scufflers\u2019 if they\u2019re triangular,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nThe distinction involves sweet baked goods too, reflecting the historical usage of \u2018cake\u2019 to mean smaller breads, rather than a sugary dessert. While \u2018bun\u2019 means \u2018bread roll\u2019 in the northern British Isles, the Scots use the term to mean a very rich fruitcake, Blaxter said. Alternatively, \u2018bun\u2019 can also refer to a diminutive version of a cupcake, minus the frosting.\n\nThen there is \u2018muffin\u2019 \u2013 the preferred term for bread roll in the northern English city of Oldham \u2013 which once used to be a both sweet and savoury type of bread. In most parts of the UK, \u2018muffin\u2019 has since narrowed to mean the sweet version.\n\nGetting lost in translation doesn\u2019t necessitate a trip overseas for us Brits at all; you could probably head 10km down the road in some places and be lost among \u2018barm cakes\u2019 instead of \u2018baps\u2019. And while most confusions are easily resolved, maybe just cross your fingers that you weren't looking for a currant-filled 'teacake' when in West Yorkshire.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The a previous version of this article included references to the term \u2018blaa\u2019, which is used to refer to a roll in Waterford, Ireland, which is not part of the UK.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

    "text": "Baby eels are one of Spain\u2019s most expensive foods, but when you see them for the first time you might wonder why.\n\nThey\u2019re not, to put it mildly, something that cries out to be eaten. When alive, they\u2019re transparent and slimy, slithering and squirming like tiny snakes. Cooked, they turn opaque and resemble limp, dead worms, except they\u2019re white with two tiny black dots for eyes. Hungry yet?\n\nThey\u2019re not something that cries out to be eaten\n\nBut lots of delicious things are not particularly good looking; what\u2019s important is the taste. Here\u2019s where it gets strange. It\u2019s not that angulas, as they\u2019re called in Spain, taste good or bad. They don\u2019t taste of much at all \u2013 which is strange because they\u2019re astronomically expensive, up to 1,000 euros a kilo. Even stranger still, legend has it they were once so unappreciated they were used as fodder for chickens and pigs. But then again, when it comes to eels, everything is strange.\n\nMany Spaniards find it difficult to understand why some people are willing to pay so much for angulas, including me. As a writer and podcaster about Spanish food and culture, I\u2019ve always found it mystifying. Especially because the traditional recipe (a la bilba\u00edna) calls for frying garlic and hot peppers in lots of olive oil and then adding angulas \u2013 a sure way to overpower their mild flavour.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 The seafood that fetches \u20ac100 a dish\n\n\u2022 The planet\u2019s most extreme cuisine?\n\n\u2022 Italy\u2019s ingenious truffle scam\n\nOf course, mystery surrounds eels, not least when it comes to their life cycle, which sounds like something out of a dark fairy tale. They live in freshwater, but can breathe through their skin and travel over land for long distances. They eat just about anything, living or dead. Then at the age of 10 or so, they swim downstream in rivers across Europe to the Atlantic Ocean and somehow (it\u2019s still unknown to science) they find their way to the Sargasso Sea, some 5,000km away. At depths of more than 500m \u2013 quite a feat for a creature that lives most of its life in shallow freshwater \u2013 they spawn and die, and their hatchlings drift on the Gulf Stream currents towards Europe, a journey that takes at least two years.\n\nWhen the angulas finally arrive on Spain\u2019s Atlantic shores, fisherman with scoop nets are waiting for them. The season starts in November, and the best time to catch them is in the middle of the coldest, blackest, rainiest nights when the tide is strong and the water is rough and turbid. Of course.\n\nWhile angulas are incredibly pricey, the first batch to go on auction every year are more expensive still. In 2016, the first lot up for sale weighed 1.25 kilos and sold for an eye-watering 5,500 euros. Wholesale. And yet the second lot, which weighed about the same, sold for a \u2018mere\u2019 1,070 euros.\n\nSo why the difference? Same baby eels, bought minutes apart, just one batch before the other. Even more curious is that both lots were bought by the same man.\n\nWhen it comes to eels, everything is strange\n\nI tracked down the buyer, Jos\u00e9 Gonzalo Hevia, who owned Casa Tista restaurant in Asturias, to ask him.\n\n\u201cIt was a bit of marketing for my restaurant and also an homage to the fisherman,\u201d said Gonzalo Hevia, now retired. He was once an angula fisherman himself. \u201cThe atmosphere at the auction is very exciting. It\u2019s a big media event. The next day, the name of my restaurant was in every newspaper and on every TV station.\u201d\n\nThat kind of publicity can bring in a lot of customers. \u201cSome of my clients came back 20 or 30 times a season to eat angulas,\u201d Gonzalo Hevia added. When I asked him what\u2019s so special about them, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s the texture more than anything.\u201d\n\nBut the texture doesn\u2019t seem so special to me. I remember them as slippery, with a very slight crunch. Still wondering why people would pay so much for them, I visited Arima, a noted Basque restaurant in Madrid, and spoke to the head chef, Rodrigo Garc\u00eda Fonseca.\n\nGarc\u00eda Fonseca, who served 3kg of them in one week this past January, also a la bilba\u00edna, said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t pay that money for them. They have no taste, no colour, nothing, not even smell. A lettuce has more aroma. But I had two guys in here that ordered half a kilo of them. Five hundred euros in one shot. Some people who have money like to spend it. Who doesn\u2019t like being a snob from time to time?\u201d\n\nNagore Irazuegi, the owner of Arima, is also from the Basque Country, where angulas are ingrained in the traditional menus of Christmas Eve, New Years and the Day of San Sebastian on 20 January. \u201cThey\u2019re way overpriced, but some people like the ostentation of it,\u201d she said. But she is quick to add that there is more to it. \u201cOn special feast days, it\u2019s just a tradition to eat them. And that ties a certain class of people together. It\u2019s a cultural thing. More than anything, people want to belong.\u201d\n\nWhether or not baby eels were once fed to livestock (everyone I spoke to had heard the same story, but little evidence exists), there\u2019s no doubt they were once the food of the working class in northern Spain. But that was back when angulas were plentiful, and therefore cheap. As angulas became scarce and prices rose, a company called Angulas Aguinaga saw an opportunity. In 1991, using surimi, a paste of processed fish, they created imitation angulas, which are called simply gulas. They look almost the same, but that\u2019s about it. Gulas are softer and taste vaguely fishy. And yet they\u2019re so popular you can find them in just about any grocery shop in Spain.\n\nIt was a perfect storm of demand\n\nPart of the reason angulas are so expensive is that dams and environmental degradation have taken a toll on eel numbers, and they are now listed as critically endangered. Overfishing has also played a part. In the past, live angulas were exported to China, where they were fattened and sold as mature eels, but that has been banned since 2010. Still, a lively black market persists. In 2017, Spanish police uncovered an international angula-trafficking operation that, when busted, had a stash of gold ingots, 1m euros in cash, plus 2m euros worth of live angulas headed for China.\n\nThree-star Michelin chefs have also played a role in the price increase. Manolo Gonz\u00e1lez, an award-winning food writer and historian from San Sebastian and secretary of one of the city\u2019s famed gastronomic clubs, Cofrad\u00eda del Ajo y el Perejil (The Brotherhood of the Garlic and Parsley), explains. \u201cWhen I was young, in the 1950s and 60s, we ate a lot of angulas. At that time, they were still considered too low class for a restaurant to serve, but in the \u201870s, the great Basque restaurants like Arzak started to cook with them, and all of a sudden, angulas were high class.\u201d\n\nNow they were not only scarce, they were also fashionable. It was a perfect storm of demand. Prices skyrocketed.\n\nAnd yet they remain popular. Why?\n\n\u201cExclusivity has always played a role in gastronomy,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez explained. He likens it to buying wines that cost 5,000 euros a bottle, way beyond their true value, but worth it to some even if only to show status. While admitting that angulas don\u2019t taste of much, Gonz\u00e1lez does enjoy the texture. \u201cAnd for a food lover, on a special occasion, 80 euros for an appetizer isn\u2019t completely out of reach.\u201d\n\nExclusivity has always played a role in gastronomy\n\nWhile he himself doesn\u2019t cook with them anymore because of the high price, the taste of the classic angula recipe with oil, garlic and hot peppers still holds fond memories.\n\n\u201cYou can make the same dish but with using spaghetti. We call it Poor Man\u2019s Angulas,\u201d he said with a touch of irony. \u201cTry it, you\u2019ll see how delicious it is!\u201d\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

    "text": "I am delighted that the BBC and ITV are working together on something truly special - BritBox. A new streaming service delivering the best home-grown content to the public who love it best\n\nThe BBC and ITV have agreed a joint vision for the service, to be called BritBox, and are now working on a formal legal agreement. The BBC and ITV anticipate that other partners will be added to BritBox and both will speak to regulators and the wider industry about their proposals.\n\n\n\nBritBox would be an original streaming service providing an unrivalled collection of British boxsets and original series, on demand, all in one place, and would provide:\n\nThe biggest collection of British content available on any streaming service\n\nBrand new commissions for British production companies specifically created for BritBox\n\nCarolyn McCall, CEO of ITV, commented on the news: \"I am really pleased that ITV and the BBC are at the concluding stage of discussions to launch a new streaming service.\n\n\"BritBox will be the home for the best of British creativity - celebrating the best of the past, the best of today and investing in new British originated content in the future.\"\n\nBBC Director-General, Tony Hall, said: \"I am delighted that the BBC and ITV are working together on something truly special - BritBox. A new streaming service delivering the best home-grown content to the public who love it best. The service will have everything from old favourites to recent shows and brand new commissions. It\u2019s an exciting time for the viewing public.\"\n\nBoth organisations are delighted with the success of their BritBox streaming service in North America, which is ahead of expectations, having already broken through targets with over half a million subscribers.\n\n\n\nThis success shows the BBC and ITV have the know-how to launch and manage a streaming service and research with the British public shows that there is a real appetite for a new British streaming service - in addition to their current subscriptions.\n\n\n\nThe aim is to launch the service in the second half of 2019. While neither the BBC or ITV can confirm pricing at this stage, it will be competitive. Consumers who are interested in subscribing to BritBox when it becomes available can do so now at www.britbox.co.uk\n\n\n\nThe BBC and ITV will provide a further update when a formal agreement is reached.\n\nNotes to Editors\n\n1. There is growing consumer demand in the UK for streaming services, with more than 12 million households having at least one SVOD service. BARB data shows that more households are taking multiple subscriptions - while the annual growth in homes with any SVOD service is 20%, the growth in homes with multiple services is 32% with four million homes now having more than one subscription.\n\n2. Research commissioned by ITV shows that desire for British content is high - with 43% of all online homes interested in subscribing to a new SVOD service which features British content. This increases to over 50% in homes with a Netflix subscription. This would be in addition to their current subscriptions.\n\nBBC Press Office"

    "text": "Image copyright EyesWideOpen/Getty Images Image caption The Great Barrier Reef in 2015\n\nAustralia plans to dump one million tonnes of sludge in the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nDespite strict laws on dumping waste, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) gave the go-ahead.\n\nIt says the works ensure boats and ships \"can safely and reliably access ports and marinas\".\n\nIt comes one week after flood water from Queensland spread into the reef, which scientists say will \"smother\" the coral.\n\nImage copyright WILLIAM WEST/Getty Images\n\nThe industrial residue is dredged from the bottom of the sea floor near Hay Point Port - one of the world's largest coal exports and a substantial economic source for the country.\n\nLarissa Waters, senator for Queensland and co-deputy leader of the Greens Party, called for the license to be revoked.\n\n\"The last thing the reef needs is more sludge dumped on it, after being slammed by the floods recently,\" she told The Guardian.\n\n\"One million tonnes of dumping dredged sludge into world heritage waters treats our reef like a rubbish tip.\"\n\nImage copyright MATT CURNOCK/TROPWATER JCU Image caption Last week, floodwaters spread more than 60km (37 miles) offshore\n\nIt's just \"another nail in the coffin\" for the World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef, which is already under stress due to climate change, according to Dr Simon Boxall from the National Oceanography Centre Southampton.\n\n\"If they are dumping it over the coral reef itself, it will have quite a devastating effect. The sludge is basically blanketing over the coral.\n\n\"The coral relies on the algae, that's what give them their colour and what helps them feed - without this partnership the coral will suffer dramatically.\"\n\nDr Boxall says his worries about sludge-dumping are short-term - with the current Australian summer a time for \"rapid algae growth\".\n\nImage copyright ullstein bild/Getty Images\n\nA GBRMPA spokesman says all of the material being dredged is naturally-occurring and was approved following a \"comprehensive\" assessment which included a 60-day public comment period.\n\nIt says the permit allows a disposal site of 14.5 sq km within the park, and that the \"spoil material will not be disposed of on coral reefs\".\n\n\"Without maintenance dredging, the Marine Park is left at a greater risk from accidents or grounding impacts of stranded vessels,\" it said in a statement.\n\nThe North Queensland Bulk Ports Corporation, which looks after Hay Point, said dumping the sludge will have a minor environmental impact.\n\nIn a statement issued online, the corporation claimed its reports showed the risks to be \"predominantly low with some temporary short-term impacts\".\n\nDr Boxall says the impact will be lessened if the sludge is taken far enough offshore, but that it will still contain high amounts of harmful materials such as trace metals.\n\n\"If it's put into shallow water it will smother sea life,\" he says.\n\n\"It's important they get it right.\n\n\"It'll cost more money but that's not the environment's problem - that's the port authorities' problem.\"\n\nLast year, Australia pledged A$500 million (\u00a3275m) to protect the Great Barrier Reef - which has lost 30% of its coral due to bleaching linked to rising sea temperatures and damage from crown-of-thorns starfish.\n\nOne of the threats listed at the time was \"large amounts of sediment\".\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here."

    "title": "Antarctica's most extreme rescue mission",
    "authors": [
      "Sandrine Ceurstemont"
    ],
    "text": "In late April 2015, Tim Nutbeam was smuggled onto a plane carrying a big bag of blood to attempt a rescue mission in Antarctica. It was the beginning of winter when the continent is draped in almost total darkness and extreme cold, not to mention frequent high winds. Due to the dangerous conditions, there are normally no scheduled flights during the six months of winter.\n\nBut Nutbeam, a consultant in emergency medicine based in the UK, went ahead with the journey, joined by a pilot and engineer.\n\nTheir mission was to save the life of a critically ill worker on an Antarctic base. Malcolm Roberts, an engineer for British Antarctic Survey, had suffered a massive gastrointestinal bleed at the Halley Research Station days before. He was thousands of miles away from the nearest hospital.\n\nRoberts had lost a lot of blood but had survived the first 24 hours. If they got to him in time, there was a chance that he would live \u2013 but there were many challenges that could prevent them from saving their patient.\n\nThe flight to Halley would take about 24 hours with one stop to refuel in Rothera, another base on the Antarctic peninsula, before making the same journey back, meaning they would be flying for about 48 hours straight. And on the way back, they would have to deal with a medical emergency at the same time, having had little sleep or rest.\n\nSaving the patient\u2019s life was challenge enough. But on top of that, how would Nutbeam be able to handle the mission psychologically?\n\nYou might also like:\n\nInitially, he wasn\u2019t even meant to go on the trip. Nutbeam was supposed to be the back-up doctor on the mission. When the emergency occurred he had flown into Punta Arenas, a town near the southernmost tip of Chile. The plan was that he would be stationed there to help after the plane landed.\n\nBut when a volcano erupted north of where he was, everything changed. The lead doctor was waiting for a connecting flight in Santiago but all flights were cancelled. At the same time, there was a rare break in weather across the Drake Passage, the body of water between southern Chile and Antarctica, where visibility is often poor. \u201cI suddenly realised that I would be going,\u201d says Nutbeam. \u201cIt was too good an opportunity to wait.\u201d\n\nNutbeam admits that everything happened so quickly that he didn\u2019t think much about the potential dangers at the time. Instead, he remembers feeling excited about getting to go to Antarctica and do the rescue.\n\nExtreme personalities\n\nThere have been few medical evacuations during the Antarctic winter. In 2016, an ill worker was airlifted from the South Pole mid-winter \u2013 when there are 24 hours of darkness \u2013 while another patient rescue took place from the main US research base in 2010.\n\nAccording to Nathan Smith, a psychology researcher at the UK\u2019s University of Manchester, people who take part in extreme expeditions often are motivated by the chance to do something that not many people do. \u201cThey are often highly trained so it\u2019s an opportunity to test their skills out and do a task they haven\u2019t done before,\u201d he says.\n\nCertain personality types are better able to deal with the stress of extreme expeditions. Research has shown that people who are less neurotic perform better. \u201cWhat we see is that people in high-risk jobs are not easily anxious and when they are, they are able to control it quite well,\u201d says Smith.\n\nConscientiousness also play a role. A study looking at the personality traits of people willing to take a parabolic flight, for example, found that conscientiousness allowed them to cope better with extreme demands. This goes against the common notion that people who take part in extreme activities are adrenaline junkies. \u201cWhat we found is that people typically spend a lot of time de-risking,\u201d says Smith. \u201cThey do a lot to avoid having an adrenaline rush because to them that signals a threat.\u201d\n\nNutbeam and his team had to be diligent to deal with the challenges they faced during the long journey. Throughout the trip, for example, Nutbeam had to monitor the temperature of the bagged blood, ensuring that it remained within a narrow optimum range. The front of the plane, where the team was huddled, was kept warm, but it was about -10C at the back. \u201cI had to try and find a sweet spot to put the blood and had to check on it every hour,\u201d he says.\n\nThe team landed in Halley just as dawn broke and had about an hour and a half to retrieve Roberts before it would be too dark to take off again. It was -30C without the windchill factor. Nutbeam took a snowmobile to the station where he successfully performed what is thought to be the first Antarctic blood transfusion on Roberts and transferred him to the plane. Meanwhile, the engineer kept the plane\u2019s engines functional, since if they got too cold they wouldn\u2019t be able to start up again.\n\nNutbeam says that nothing was meticulously planned due to the unpredictable circumstances. His strategy was to \u201cwing it in an informed way\u201d.\n\nExcessive planning was less important than having confidence in one\u2019s skills\n\nAfter interviewing expeditioners, Smith and his colleagues found that excessive planning was less important than having confidence in one\u2019s skills. \u201cThen it comes down to being flexible and adaptable and being able to adjust to the situation as it unfolds,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are lots of things you can\u2019t control so being able to accept that is really important.\u201d\n\nSleep deprivation\n\nEven a combination of expertise, conscientiousness and confidence could not make up for perhaps the biggest challenge: the extreme sleep deprivation of the 48-hour flights. Nutbeam says that he slept for about four hours over the course of the mission. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t functioning as a human,\u201d he adds.\n\nMicrosleeps \u2013 quick bouts of shut-eye that can last between a fraction of a second and 30 seconds \u2013 can help the body recuperate. \u201cThe brain finds ways to catch up on sleep in short bouts if it can\u2019t otherwise obtain the sleep it needs,\u201d says Hans Van Dongen, the director of the Sleep and Performance Research Center at Washington State University in the US.\n\nHowever, microsleeps cause lapses in attention that affect performance \u2013 if they occur while driving often resulting in car accidents for example.\n\nNutbeam was so tired that he had trouble recalling medical knowledge and making choices\n\nDuring the long flight back to Chile, Nutbeam was so tired that he had trouble recalling medical knowledge and making choices. And that posed some serious dangers, given that Roberts\u2019 condition required constant monitoring and there were important medical decisions to be made. Around Rothera, for example, they needed to be flying high to pass the tall mountains below. Roberts, however, had a low circulatory blood volume due to his bleed, which affects how long he could tolerate high altitude without the need for more blood.\n\n\u201cI needed to make a decision about Malcolm\u2019s care and just could not decide,\u201d says Nutbeam \u2013 an unfamiliar sensation for him. \u201cI am normally pretty pragmatic in my approach and don\u2019t struggle with decisions.\u201d\n\nSleep also plays a role in regulating emotions and can affect mood: the emotional centers in the brain are less connected when a person hasn\u2019t had enough rest so it\u2019s harder to control one\u2019s feelings. As a result, sleep-deprived people can be overly grumpy or giddy, says Von Dongen.\n\nAnd this would be an additional challenge to Nutbeam\u2019s decision making when, at a later point in the flight, Roberts suffered a stroke. Nutbeam had to give him more blood as well as fluid and medication to stabilise him. \u201cI remember feeling quite emotionally overwhelmed,\u201d says Nutbeam. \u201cHe must have been feeling terrible but was incredibly stoical.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding the effects of sleep loss can help people cope, says Smith. \u201cPeople can prepare for it and think about how it might shape their decision-making,\u201d he says. Nutbeam says that he knows that he is much less tolerant when he\u2019s tired, which might have helped.\n\nTeamwork\n\nNutbeam was also fortunate to have a dedicated team that helped to keep his sleep-deprived mind in check. In addition to the team aboard the plane, there was a remote support network keeping a close eye on their journey from afar.\n\nDuring stopovers, when they were able to communicate, colleagues abroad informed the team of weather conditions to help ease the logistical decision making.\n\nNutbeam also had regular debriefs with his boss in the UK about treatment and what to do in various circumstances.\n\nWhen the plane landed in Rothera, for example, Roberts had another gastrointestinal bleed. There was a doctor there to help. But Nutbeam didn\u2019t want to leave Roberts, even though he was exhausted.\n\nA call from his boss in the UK put things in order. She told Nutbeam to let the local doctor take over so he could get some sleep: he was the only one that could look after Roberts during the remaining flight. \u201cIt was the best advice in the world,\u201d says Nutbeam. \u201cOtherwise I think I would have stayed with him and been even more tired and psychologically broken for the final leg of the journey.\u201d\n\nTense situations can be easier to handle when there are others around. \u201cBeing in a dangerous environment surrounded by competent people who are supportive is a good way of mitigating stress,\u201d says Smith.\n\nIt all depends on the team dynamics, though: if people aren\u2019t able to work well together it can have a negative impact on the functioning of the group. Personality traits \u2013 in particular agreeableness - can often predict who will be a good team player. \u201cPeople that have to work in small groups in risky settings tend to be good at getting on with people,\u201d says Smith. \u201cThey are good at communicating effectively and maintaining group function.\u201d\n\nAftermath\n\nAfter the final flight from Rothera, the plane landed in Punta Arenas, Chile. Roberts was transferred to a hospital where he was successfully treated. But Nutbeam didn\u2019t feel like the mission was over yet. \u201cI really didn\u2019t want to let Malcolm go,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to go with him to the hospital even though I could hardly string a sentence together.\u201d\n\nExpedition groups often have similar reaction when they return. After having lived through an intense experience together, there is a sense of empathy among those who were there, says Smith. It can also be hard to communicate what it was like to people who weren\u2019t present so there is a tendency to be drawn to those who shared the experience.\n\nNutbeam was able to visit Roberts regularly at the hospital and there was a daily meeting about his recovery which gradually helped him readjust.\n\nAccording to Smith, people often reflect on what happened and what could have happened for about three weeks afterwards. After playing an important part in a mission, people may feel like they have no purpose when they return but finding something meaningful to do can ease the transition.\n\n\u201cWriting a report or putting your experience into a story is really helpful psychologically,\u201d says Smith.\n\nNew types of training could help too. People working in extreme environments, such as astronauts or military workers, do a lot of simulations as preparation. But according to Smith, it\u2019s rare to have training that focusses on the psychological aspects of a mission. \u201cIt seems a bit like missing a trick,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a lot that could be done to equip people with strategies to deal with these environments.\u201d\n\nIn a sense, the rescue was just a more extreme version of what emergency room doctors encounter every day.\n\nAs a coping strategy, Nutbeam recommends mentally rehearsing events beforehand when well-rested. \u201cThis can prepare your mind for the insult of sleep deprivation,\u201d he says.\n\nUpon reflection, Nutbeam isn\u2019t convinced that he would take part in such a mission again. He had mentally prepared himself to be the back-up doctor so hadn\u2019t analysed the risks involved beforehand. Now he realises that there was a significant chance that they could have been stranded or suffered harm. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to reflect on a successful rescue but there is a need to consider all the opportunities for it to go wrong and was the risk justified,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve still not quite got my mind around that.\u201d\n\n--\n\nTim Nutbeam talked about the expedition for the first time at the World Extreme Medicine conference in Edinburgh in November 2018.

    "text": "Image copyright EUPA Image caption The \"dog\" was treated by vets at an animal clinic\n\nKind-hearted Estonian workers rushed to rescue a dog in distress from a freezing river on Wednesday - unaware of the fact they were actually about to bundle a wild wolf into their car.\n\nThe men were working on the Sindi dam on the Parnu river when they spotted the animal trapped in the icy water.\n\nAfter clearing a path through the ice, they took the frozen canine to a clinic for medical care.\n\nOnly then was it revealed they had been carrying a wolf.\n\nImage copyright EUPA Image caption The wolf was covered in ice when pulled from the near-frozen water\n\nThe Estonian Union for the Protection of Animals (EUPA) said the wolf had low blood pressure when it arrived at the veterinarian's office, which may have explained its docile nature after the men carried it to their car to warm it up.\n\nSpeaking to the Estonian newspaper Postimees, one of the men, Rando Kartsepp, said: \"We had to carry him over the slope. He weighed a fair bit.\"\n\n\"He was calm, slept on my legs. When I wanted to stretch them, he raised his head for a moment,\" he added.\n\nVeterinarians had some suspicions over the large dog's true nature, but it was a local hunter, familiar with the region's wolves, who finally confirmed it for what it was: a young male wolf, about a year old.\n\nImage copyright EUPA Image caption \"He was calm, slept on my legs,\" Mr Kartsepp said of the journey to the vet's office\n\nArmed with this new information, clinic staff decided to put the wolf in a cage after treatment - in case it became less docile once it recovered.\n\nThe EUPA said it paid for the animal's treatment, and that \"luckily, everything turned out well\".\n\nThe wolf recovered from its brush with death within the day and, after being fitted with a GPS collar by researchers from the national environmental agency, was released back into the wild.\n\n\"We are so happy for the outcome of the story, and wish to thank all the participants \u2013 especially these men who rescued the wolf and the doctors of the clinic who were not afraid to treat and nurture the wild animal,\" EUPA said.\n\nEstonia is home to hundreds of wolves, only a handful of which have been collared in recent years. As a species, they usually avoid humans.\n\nIt was picked as Estonia's national animal last year by a group of nature organisations."

    "text": "Image copyright Rosie Kay Dance Company\n\nTwenty-two-year-old Alex Smith is a serving soldier in the British Army who nearly went into a very different profession - ballet. For two years he kept his talents a secret from his fellow soldiers.\n\nTrooper Alex Smith of the Queen's Dragoon Guards is wearing his uniform and he's ready for duty. But today, unusually, he's in a theatre.\n\nAlex is appearing in a contemporary dance production called 5 Soldiers, a work created by choreographer Rosie Kay about all aspects of military life - the rigorous training, the friendships and the stress of going into conflict.\n\nAs a trained soldier, Alex has first-hand experience of what life is really like in the British Army - and yet he is also a trained dancer, having studied ballet, tap, jazz, modern and contemporary dance.\n\n\"I started dancing when I was six years old,\" he says. \"Every week it would be dropping my sister off to dance classes and after a while you are just sitting there and you're bored and you're just like, 'Aww, let me do something.' And then I watched one of the classes and I thought, 'I could do that, it looks so easy.' So that's why I joined.\"\n\nImage copyright Alex Smith\n\nGrowing up in the rugby-playing town of Cwmbran, Torfaen, Alex often found himself the only boy at dance class.\n\n\"Male dancers want to jump higher and spin faster and look better than each other on stage. But because my school was in south Wales, there were hardly any lads that wanted to dance. So the big aim for me was to be more flexible than the girls in class. That was one of the main things I wanted when I was younger.\"\n\nAfter a course at a performing arts school in Cornwall, Alex was awarded a place at the prestigious Northern Ballet School in 2015 - yet half way through the course, he decided to leave.\n\n\"The thought of getting a job at the end was probably one of my biggest fears,\" he says.\n\nThe life of a dancer can be an unstable one, going from one contract to the next, often with periods of joblessness.\n\nOne evening Alex was walking home from dance school in Manchester when it occurred to him how to achieve greater job security.\n\n\"I walked past an Army's career centre and I just looked into the window for two or three minutes and realised maybe that is the next step for me, the next window for me to go through to better myself as a person,\" he says.\n\nHe says that, despite appearances, dancers and soldiers have quite a lot in common. Self-discipline is important in both cases, and a determination to succeed.\n\n\"Dancers are very driven, motivated and they want to get the end product, they want to get that performance on stage that looks perfect. And then you've got soldiers who are dedicated, driven and they want to soldier to the highest of levels,\" he says.\n\nAnd both roles also require high levels of fitness - so Alex was well-prepared for the physical tests he and other applicants had to undergo.\n\n\"I had probably the quickest run time on the day for the mile and a half,\" says Alex. \"I think dance carried me through selection and then it carried me through basic training, because I was quite physically fit. I could carry the weight because I was used to lifting girls.\"\n\nAt first Alex only told his girlfriend, a dancer, that he was applying for the Army. It wasn't until he was awarded a place that he told his mum he was leaving dance school and coming home.\n\nImage copyright Alex Smith\n\n\"Obviously she wasn't thrilled,\" says Alex. \"Because all the hard work and everything that I'd put into the last 18 years of my life she said I'd thrown it away, but I don't believe in that statement because I think it's made me the person I am today and it's made me a better person.\"\n\nAlex says any parent who has a son or daughter in the armed services fears that they will one day be deployed to a war zone. But his mother has now accepted his new career, he says - and is delighted that he is now combining it with dance.\n\nWhen he joined the Army, he decided not to mention his dance training to the other soldiers, because he didn't want them to have any preconceived ideas about him.\n\nHe didn't mention his audition for the role in 5 Soldiers either. All the other dancers there were professionals, so he didn't expect to get the role - and was shocked when he got a call from the choreographer on his way back to camp, telling him that he had been successful.\n\nThe next morning he told his fellow soldiers all about it, revealing his hidden talent for the first time.\n\nImage copyright Rosie Kay Dance Company\n\n\"To be honest nothing really changed, because I'd already earned the respect of everyone, because I was fit and a good soldier and I kept my head down and I did what I had to do,\" he says.\n\n\"So when I said, 'Oh by the way I'm going to do dance,' most of them were quite jealous.\"\n\nThere has been no teasing, he says.\n\n\"I think the army's changed since a few years ago,\" he says. \"No-one will give you stick because you're all in it together, and obviously everyone has their own reasons for joining.\n\n\"Some join to forget their past lives or some join to better themselves, like me, and so it's not like school, it's a very grown-up environment where you do what you want to do, as long as you get the task done at the end of the day. It doesn't matter what you do in your spare time or what you've done in your past life.\"\n\nAt school it was very different, he says. There was \"the odd idiot who thinks he's funny\", as he puts it.\n\n\"I went to a Welsh medium school and the teachers weren't much help, they just thought, 'Oh yeah, they're only having banter.'\"\n\nAlex says this had an impact on his studies.\n\n\"I wasn't really interested in learning. I just didn't want to be there,\" he says. \"But since I'm older I don't care - people can say what they want. Everyone's got their own opinions, I don't have to care about it.\"\n\nImage copyright Rosie Kay Dance Company\n\nIn rehearsals for 5 Soldiers, Alex says he found himself using muscles that he hadn't used for a while.\n\n\"While I'm here I'm still going for runs and we do warm-ups in the morning where we're doing press-ups, sit-ups and that sort of thing,\" he says. \"I think I'll go back to the army a fitter soldier, to be honest.\"\n\nHe says he's enjoying being a dancer again, but that the most nervous night of his life will be when some of his squadron come to watch him perform.\n\n\"They're serving soldiers and I want them to feel as if it is real - as real as it is on camp,\" he says.\n\n\"I don't want them to come in and go, 'Err I'm watching a ballet.' Because it's not a ballet, it's a piece of dance that's re-enacting the life of a soldier in camp and on tour.\n\n\"The scene where we're patrolling around - in my head I'm feeling like, 'Yes I am on patrol and I'm working with fellow soldiers and not just working with four other dancers.'\"\n\nHe says the piece will also crush a few stereotypes.\n\nImage copyright Rosie Kay Dance Company\n\n\"It isn't just boys jumping around in tutus with pointe shoes on and makeup, it is men being men on stage.\"\n\nThe Army has been very supportive, he says, giving him time off to take part in the rehearsals and the production. He will return to his regiment in July after the tour is over.\n\n\"My ambitions at the minute are to go back and see how far I can take my soldiering career, see how far I can push myself, because I am a very ambitious person,\" he says.\n\n\"I do work hard for what I want and if I want something I will try my best to get it, and I think the Army's instilled that in me from training.\"\n\nHe is not sure yet, however, what the future might hold for him with dance, but is keen to find out if there are any other dancing soldiers out there.\n\n\"At the moment I'm just trying to enjoy 5 soldiers and take everything on board and just live this dream, all that I've worked for for the last 18 years,\" he says.\n\n\"I am just very appreciative that all the training that I have done, and all my teachers - which I am really thankful for - have been able to put me in this position.\"\n\nThe Rosie Kay Dance Company's production of 5 Soldiers will be touring the UK, Denmark and the US.\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter."

    "text": "Halfway up the mountain, Enkhbaatar disappeared.\n\n\u201cEnkhbaatar, where are you?\u201d We swivelled, trying to spot his white hat through the tangled branches. This was no place to lose one\u2019s guide. We were only a few kilometres below the Siberian border, in a dense, subarctic pine forest known as a taiga. It was famously remote, even by Mongolian standards.\n\nThunk.\n\nSomething hit the ground near my feet and rolled down the slope. I looked up to see Enkhbaatar nearly 10m in the air, clinging to the top of a pine tree. He yanked an object from the swaying branches and pitched it toward us.\n\n\u201cGet it!\u201d\n\nI skidded downhill, but Enkhbaatar\u2019s six-year-old son got there first. He snatched up the fruit-like object and started to gnaw. Spitting out a mouthful of purple rind, he showed me the prize beneath: rows of yellow pine nuts. The local equivalent of popcorn or crisps, pine nuts are eaten uninhibitedly, by the bagful, because they taste so good.\n\nEnkhbaatar tossed down a plastic sack for us to carry his haul. I knew pine cones as dry, squirrel-plundered husks; these were fat and ripe, with quilted skins like a pineapple. Their sticky sap glued dirt to our hands as we searched for more.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 Georgia\u2019s addictive cousin to pizza?\n\n\u2022 Why Genghis Khan\u2019s tomb can\u2019t be found\n\n\u2022 The truth about Japanese tempura\n\nFor me this was a novelty, but for Enkhbaatar it is daily life. He belongs to the Tsaatan, an ethnic minority who herd reindeer along Mongolia\u2019s northern fringes. They live in tents alongside their animals and are essentially self-sufficient. Hunting pine cones in the taiga is the Tsaatan version of loading up on snacks at the supermarket.\n\nCaught between tundra and desert, northern Mongolia\u2019s agricultural options are limited; a severe climate renders much of the land infertile and restricts grazing. So Tsaatan families move seasonally with their herds to find pasture. They eat the meat, milk and cheese the reindeer provide, but their diet, with its abundance of protein and fats, lacks the vitamins and minerals usually obtained from fruits and vegetables. This nomadic lifestyle \u2013 and its culinary limitations \u2013 is typical throughout Mongolia and remains largely unchanged since the days of Genghis Khan.\n\nHunting pine cones in the taiga is the Tsaatan version of loading up on snacks at the supermarket\n\nPine nuts help balance the meat-heavy diet. They are rich in iron and vitamin A \u2013 common nutritional deficiencies in children across the country, according to The World Bank \u2013 as well as potassium, magnesium and zinc.\n\nFor the Tsaatan, the taiga ecosystem is a benefit of living along the nation\u2019s isolated northern border; pine nuts cannot be found in the grasslands of southern Mongolia. Enkhbaatar\u2019s family collects pine nuts every autumn to roast over the fire. They make a refreshing change from meat and milk; after a few days subsisting on salted mutton and reindeer cheese, the nuts tasted wonderfully clean and fresh to me.\n\nSeveral months later in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia\u2019s capital city, deep winter cold had me yearning for that remembered flavour. Surprisingly, I didn\u2019t have to go far to find it. Despite the availability of imported fruits and vegetables \u2013 not to mention fast food chains and coffee shops \u2013 city residents had a taste for pine nuts, too.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re addictive,\u201d my friend Byambaa told me as we walked the freezing streets. She wanted to get several kilos, but there weren\u2019t any trees to climb in this glass and cement city. We needed a seller. While a few upscale restaurants offered pine nuts Western-style \u2013 sprinkled frugally over pasta \u2013 street vendors sold them by the bag.\n\nAs a kid in the forests of Khentii Province, located north-east of Ulaanbaatar along the Siberian border, Byambaa had helped her father clean, cook and sell pine nuts for extra income. Nowadays the business of selling the nuts requires permits and paperwork, and the majority of the harvest is exported to China. Mongolians can gather up to 25kg each year for their own use, but most rely on a supplier like Samjmiatav Azjargal.\n\nWe found Azjargal\u2019s stand on a busy intersection near Ulaanbaatar\u2019s downtown landmark, the State Department Store. It was a great place for foot traffic but terrible for the elements. In winter, Ulaanbaatar is the coldest and one of the most polluted capital cities in the world, and Azjargal was mummified in thermal clothes with a green scarf wound over her pollution mask. She topped up a steaming cup of aarts, a traditional soured milk, from a thermos as we discussed her wares.\n\nPine nuts are eaten uninhibitedly, by the bagful, because they taste so good\n\nShe sells three varieties of pine nuts: raw, cooked and shelled. Like Enkhbaatar, she roasted them in a large pan over a fire \u2013 with no oil, salt or spices. The dried nuts took on a shiny brown quality, like coffee beans. They were displayed in heaps on makeshift tables and measured out in glass mugs. Transactions were swift \u2013 nuts scooped into a plastic bag, colourful tugrik notes changing hands \u2013 as passers-by sped towards warmth.\n\nAzjargal\u2019s husband and brothers spend the autumn season travelling through the northern provinces of Khentii, Selenge, Khovsgol and Zarkhan to pick pine cones. Sometimes they bring the whole family, turning the expedition into a camping trip. She pulled out her phone to show us photos from this year\u2019s harvest; the green, sunlit pictures pulled me out of Ulaanbaatar\u2019s cement chill and back to my memories of the taiga.\n\nAccording to Azjargal, all that tree climbing by Enkhbaatar had been unnecessary. Pine nuts had just come into season when I visited the taiga in August; by mid-October, the cones would have been ripe enough to literally shake off the trees. But there are more than hungry squirrels to contend with. Pine nuts are big business these days, and many people start early to get ahead of the competition. Azjargal confided that she had also begun in August, allowing the nuts to ripen in their cones for several weeks after being picked. Stored in a dry place they would last all year.\n\nAzjargal bagged our order, apologising for her prices. It had been a bad harvest, she said, and roasted nuts were up to 13,000 tugrik (roughly $5) per kilogram from last year\u2019s 8,000 ($3). Shelled were three times more expensive, so most people preferred to bite the nuts open themselves and spit out the shells, the way Americans eat peanuts at a ballgame. According to Azjargal, good harvests come in a three-year cycle, and she expected prices to stay high through next winter. I didn\u2019t complain; a kilogram of shelled pine nuts costs $60 in the United States, where I\u2019m from.\n\nHanding over my bag, Azjargal suggested I steep the nuts in vodka. The infused liquor, she said, is good for women\u2019s health. Instead, Byambaa and I decided on coffee to warm up. We opened the bag of pine nuts, and a pile of empty shells grew between us on the cafe table. The cooked nuts were milder than the ones I\u2019d eaten raw with Enkhbaatar. They had a soft texture and tasted lightly of almonds. And Byambaa was right \u2013 they were addictive.\n\nOutside the window, Azjargal nimbly kept up with demand. Knots of school children, women wrapped in expensive furs, mechanics in grubby pants \u2013 everyone stopped for a snack on their way home. Given a choice between a bag of crisps in a heated store and chilled pine nuts from a near-frozen street vendor, Mongolians know there is no contest.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story mistakenly said pine nuts contained vitamin D.

    "text": "Dairy milk has competition. Alternative \u201cmilks\u201d made from plants like soya or almonds are increasingly popular. These alternatives are often vegan-friendly and can be suitable for people who are allergic to milk, or intolerant of it. The runner-up in the 2018 series of The Apprentice (UK) ran a flavoured nut milk business.\n\nBut the rise of alternative milks is just the latest twist in the saga of humanity\u2019s relationship with animal milk. This relationship dates back thousands of years, and it has had a lot of ups and downs.\n\nWhen you think about it, milk is a weird thing to drink. It\u2019s a liquid made by a cow or other animal to feed its young; we have to squirt it out of the cow\u2019s udders to obtain it.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 We don\u2019t need nearly as much protein as we consume\n\n\u2022 What would happen if the world went vegetarian?\n\n\u2022 Should you avoid dairy when you have a cold?\n\nIn many cultures it is almost unheard of. Back in 2000, China launched a nationwide campaign to encourage people to consume more milk and dairy products for health reasons \u2013 a campaign that had to overcome the deep suspicions of many older Chinese people. Cheese, which is essentially milk that has been allowed to go off, can still make many Chinese people feel sick.\n\nSet against the 300,000-year history of our species, drinking milk is quite a new habit. Before about 10,000 years ago or so, hardly anybody drank milk, and then only on rare occasions. The first people to drink milk regularly were early farmers and pastoralists in western Europe \u2013 some of the first humans to live with domesticated animals, including cows. Today, drinking milk is common practice in northern Europe, North America, and a patchwork of other places.\n\nBaby food\n\nThere is a biological reason why drinking animal milk is odd.\n\nMilk contains a type of sugar called lactose, which is distinct from the sugars found in fruit and other sweet foods. When we are babies, our bodies make a special enzyme called lactase that allows us to digest the lactose in our mother\u2019s milk. But after we are weaned in early childhood, for many people this stops. Without lactase, we cannot properly digest the lactose in milk. As a result, if an adult drinks a lot of milk they may experience flatulence, painful cramps and even diarrhoea. (It\u2019s worth noting that in other mammals, there aren\u2019t any lactase-persistent adults \u2013 adult cows don\u2019t have active lactase, and neither do cats or dogs, for example).\n\nSo the first Europeans who drank milk probably farted a lot as a result. But then evolution kicked in: some people began to keep their lactase enzymes active into adulthood. This \u201clactase persistence\u201d allowed them to drink milk without side effects. It is the result of mutations in a section of DNA that controls the activity of the lactase gene.\n\n\u201cThe first time that we see the lactase persistence allele in Europe arising is around 5,000 years BP [before present] in southern Europe, and then it starts to kick in in central Europe around 3,000 years ago,\u201d says assistant professor Laure S\u00e9gurel at the Museum of Humankind in Paris, who co-authored a 2017 review of the science of lactase persistence.\n\nThe lactase persistence trait was favoured by evolution and today it is extremely common in some populations. In northern Europe, more than 90% of people are lactase persistent. The same is true in a few populations in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nBut there are also many populations where lactase persistence is much rarer: many Africans do not have the trait and it is uncommon in Asia and South America.\n\nIt is hard to make sense of this pattern because we don\u2019t know precisely why drinking milk, and therefore lactase persistence, was a good thing, says S\u00e9gurel: \u201cWhy was it so strongly advantageous in itself?\u201d\n\nThe obvious answer is that drinking milk gave people a new source of nutrients, reducing the risk of starvation. But on closer inspection this doesn\u2019t hold up.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of different sources of food, so it\u2019s surprising that one source of food is so important, so different from other sorts of food,\u201d says S\u00e9gurel.\n\nPeople who are lactase-non-persistent can still eat a certain amount of lactose without ill effects, so drinking a small amount of milk is fine. There is also the option of processing milk into butter, yoghurt, cream or cheese \u2013 all of which reduce the amount of lactose. Hard cheeses like cheddar have less than 10% as much lactose as milk, and butter is similarly low. (Read more about parmigiano, a cheese with so little lactose it can be eaten by the lactose-intolerant). \u201cHeavy cream and butter have the lowest lactose,\u201d says S\u00e9gurel.\n\nAccordingly, people seem to have invented cheese rather quickly. In September 2018, archaeologists reporting finding fragments of pottery in what is now Croatia. They carried fatty acids, suggesting that the pottery had been used to separate curds from whey: a crucial step in making cheese. If that is correct (and the interpretation has been questioned), people were making cheese in southern Europe 7,200 years ago. Similar evidence from slightly more recent times, but still more than 6,000 years ago, has been found elsewhere in Europe. This is well before lactase persistence became common in Europeans.\n\nThat said, there is clearly a pattern behind which populations evolved high levels of lactase persistence and which didn\u2019t, says genetics professor Dallas Swallow of University College London. Those with the trait are pastoralists: people who raise livestock. Hunter-gatherers, who do not keep animals, did not acquire the mutations. Neither did \u201cforest gardeners\u201d who cultivated plants, but not livestock.\n\nIt makes sense that people who did not have access to animal milk were not under great evolutionary pressure to adapt to drinking it.\n\nThe question is, why did some pastoralist people acquire the trait and not others?\n\nS\u00e9gurel points to east Asian herding peoples, such as those in Mongolia, who have some of the lowest rates of lactase persistence even though they rely heavily on milk from their animals for food. The mutations were common in nearby populations in Europe and western Asia, so it would have been possible for them to spread into these east Asian groups, but they didn\u2019t. \u201cThat\u2019s the big puzzle,\u201d says S\u00e9gurel.\n\nDairy benefits\n\nDrinking milk might have other advantages besides its nutritional value\n\nShe speculates that drinking milk might have other advantages besides its nutritional value. People who keep livestock are exposed to their diseases, which can include anthrax and cryptosporidiosis. It may be that drinking cow\u2019s milk provides antibodies against some of these infections. Indeed, milk's protective effect is thought to be one of the benefits of breastfeeding children.\n\nBut some of the mysterious absences of lactase-persistence could be down to sheer chance: whether anyone in a group of pastoralists happened to get the right mutation. Until fairly recently there were a lot fewer people on Earth and local populations were smaller, so some groups would miss out by plain bad luck.\n\n\u201cI think the most coherent part of the picture is that there\u2019s a correlation with the way of life, with pastoralism,\u201d says Swallow. \u201cBut you have to have the mutation first.\u201d Only then could natural selection go to work.\n\nIn the case of Mongolian herders, Swallow points out that they typically drink fermented milk, which again has a lower lactose content. Arguably, the ease with which milk can be processed to be more edible makes the rise of lactase persistence even more puzzling. \u201cBecause we were so good at adapting culturally to processing and fermenting the milk, I\u2019m struggling with why we ever adapted genetically,\u201d says Swallow\u2019s PhD student Catherine Walker.\n\nThere may have been several factors promoting lactase persistence, not just one. Swallow suspects that the key may have been milk\u2019s nutritional benefits, such as that it is rich in fat, protein, sugar and micronutrients like calcium and vitamin D.\n\nIt is also a source of clean water. Depending on where your community lived, you may have evolved to tolerate it for one reason over another.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether lactase persistence is still being actively favoured by evolution, and thus whether it will become more widespread, says Swallow. In 2018 she co-authored a study of a group of pastoralists in the Coquimbo region of Chile, who acquired the lactase-persistence mutation when their ancestors interbred with newly-arrived Europeans 500 years ago. The trait is now spreading through the population: it is being favoured by evolution, as it was in northern Europeans 5,000 years ago.\n\nBut this is a special case because the Coquimbo people are heavily reliant on milk. Globally, the picture is very different. \u201cI would think it\u2019s stabilised myself, except in countries where they have milk dependence and there is a shortage [of other food],\u201d says Swallow. \u201cIn the West, where we have such good diets, the selective pressures are not really likely to be there.\u201d\n\nDairy decline?\n\nIf anything, the news over the last few years offers the opposite impression: that people are abandoning milk. In November 2018, the Guardian published a story headlined \u201cHow we fell out of love with milk\u201d, describing the meteoric rise of the companies selling oat and nut milks, and suggesting that traditional milk is facing a major battle.\n\nBut the statistics tell a different story. According to the 2018 report of the IFCN Dairy Research Network, global milk production has increased every year since 1998 in response to growing demand. In 2017, 864 million tonnes of milk were produced worldwide. This shows no sign of slowing down: the IFCN expects milk demand to rise 35% by 2030 to 1,168 million tonnes. (Read more about how milk became a staple food in industrialised societies).\n\nStill, this masks some more localised trends. A 2010 study of food consumption found that in the US milk consumption has fallen over the last few decades \u2013 although it was replaced with fizzy drinks, not almond milk. This fall was balanced by growing demand in developing countries, especially in Asia \u2013 something the IFCN has also noted. Meanwhile, a 2015 study of people\u2019s drinking habits in 187 countries found that milk drinking was more common in older people, which does suggest that it is less popular with the young \u2013 although this says nothing about young people\u2019s consumption of milk products like yoghurt.\n\nStill, it seems unlikely that alternative milks will make much of a dent in the world\u2019s growing appetite for milk, at least over the next decade.\n\nWalker adds that alternative milks are \u201cnot a like-for-like substitution\u201d for animal milk. In particular, many don\u2019t have the same micronutrients. She says they are most useful for vegans and for people allergic to milk \u2013 the latter being a reaction to milk protein, and nothing to do with lactose.\n\nIt\u2019s particularly striking that so much of the growth in milk demand is in Asia, where most people are non-lactase-persistent. Whatever advantages the people there see in milk, they outweigh the potential digestive issues or the need to process the milk.\n\nIn fact, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation has pushed for people in developing countries to keep more non-traditional dairy animals, such as llamas, so that they can obtain the benefits of milk even if cow\u2019s milk is unavailable or too expensive.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, a major study published in January described a \u201cplanetary health diet\u201d that is designed to both maximise health and minimise our impact on the environment. While it entails drastically cutting down on red meat and other animal products, it nevertheless includes the equivalent of one glass of milk a day.\n\nMilk, it seems, is not down and out. If anything it\u2019s still on the up \u2013 even if our bodies have mostly stopped evolving in response to it.\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "text": "Fabulous fashion creations aside, \u2018Kaiser\u2019 Karl Lagerfeld \u2013 who has been at the creative helm of Chanel since 1983 and has been designing for Fendi since 1965 \u2013 has gained notoriety for his candid critical assassinations of public figures. With his acerbic interjections he\u2019s effortlessly pulverizing, be it Adele (\u201ca little too fat\u201d), Pippa Middleton (\u201cShe should only show her back\u201d) or the late Andy Warhol (\u201cI shouldn\u2019t say this, but physically he was quite repulsive\u201d). But his critical eye is also ever trained on himself.\n\nMischievous and forthcoming in interviews, the octogenarian designer will as willingly disclose his personal style strategies and standards as his shortcomings; who else would refer to their natural hair shade as \u201ca little pee-pee yellow\u201d or their sunglasses as their \u201cburka\u201d? An interview with Lagerfeld in the inaugural issue of M Magazine, for instance, saw him share his aversion to flip-flops, his view on socks (\u201cI like socks, but only up to the knee. I hate nothing more than when men cross their legs, and you see hairy legs, socks and pants \u2013 the worst. The worst!\u201d), his style staples since a child (\u201cshirts, high collars, ties and bow ties\u201d) and appreciation of the arm-lengthening appeal of gloves: \u201cYou know what it means in French to have a long arm? It means you are influential.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am like a caricature of myself, and I like that. It is like a mask. And for me the Carnival of Venice lasts all year long,\u201d he once said of his signature anachronistic suited-and-booted look, that of an 18th-Century aristocrat time-warped into the 21st Century. There\u2019s the powdered ponytail \u2013 he\u2019s had the same \u2019do since 1976, whitened daily with clouds of Klorane dry shampoo \u2013 and ensemble of crisp white, high-collared shirts by Hilditch & Key with black tailored jacket and jeans, punctuated with a tie, shades, fingerless gloves (from historic French manufacturer Causse) and custom-made black crocodile boots by Massaro. Not forgetting the ornate brooches and jangling fingerloads of rings \u00e0 la Henry VIII, with designs ranging from chunky silver Chrome Hearts creations to exquisite vintage Gothic and Art Deco designs from Paris jeweller Lydia Courteille. However, since smoking bans have come into place, the clean-living designer \u2013 who may favour rock\u2019n\u2019roll garb but has never indulged in drink, drugs or cigarettes himself \u2013 has stored away his collection of fans with which, during his nightclubbing days in the \u201970s and \u201980s, he used to waft smoke away.\n\nSo fixed is Lagerfeld\u2019s key silhouette, it gives the impression that he wears the same outfit every day, yet panning shots of his bulging clothing racks in the Rodolphe Marconi\u2019s 2007 documentary Lagerfeld Confidential prove otherwise. A self-confessed \u201cshirt freak\u201d who\u2019s captured in his dressing room rifling through a drawer of unfolded stiff white collars and fingering bowls of rings, Lagerfeld constantly updates his look with new elements, be it striped shirts with matching wide ties or Dior jackets with tails. He combines classics with cult contemporary designers, such as Haider Ackermann and Sacai, occasionally breaking up his silhouette with a gold Dior baseball jacket, say, or even a duffel coat.\n\nLagerfeld once said, \u201cI am a fashion person, and fashion is not only about clothes \u2013 it\u2019s about all kinds of change,\u201d and he certainly experimented with a few looks in his youth. \u201cI did everything! Not too big in the shoulders because I had the feeling I looked like a midget. But I did the hippie look, with chains and things like this, fur capes, high boots, Renoma suits with large lapels... I did everything, of course!\u201d he told M magazine. Photographic evidence includes the Antonio Lopez shot of him posing in a mankini-style bathing suit in the \u201970s, Adonis-like with his buff physique and dripping wet curly locks.\n\nA great admirer of the advertising world, Lagerfeld \u2013 who photographs all of Chanel\u2019s campaigns himself \u2013 is a brilliant marketer: he is one pulling the strings behind his own image. He sported simpler iterations of today\u2019s silhouette decades ago but, over the past few years, has taken it to such stylised heights that he would easily stand out in a football stadium. Alongside collaborations galore \u2013 from Diet Coke to Steiff teddy bears \u2013 stamped with his iconic profile, a focused push on his signature clothing line, Lagerfeld Collection, saw the opening of a new flagship store on London\u2019s Regent Street earlier this month, pedalling accessories such as shades, starched white collars and leather mittens in his image.\n\n\u2018Labelfeld not Lagerfeld\u2019\n\n\u201cLagerfeld is the celebrity that the fashion industry has spawned,\u201d wrote Pulitzer Prize-winning fashion journalist Robin Givhan in a scathing 2012 Newsweek article, in which she claimed he is \u201coverrated\u201d. For Givhan, Lagerfeld\u2019s public persona became even more \u201cself-consciously nurtured\u201d following his dramatic 90lb (40kg) weight loss at the turn of the millennium, which saw a streamlining of his look into a \u201ccostume of skinny Diesel jeans, tight-fitting Dior Homme suits, and fingerless gloves\u201d. \u201cHis is a different sort of promotion than that of designers who have posed in their own advertising campaigns \u2013 naked or otherwise. They are hawking a product, albeit personally and provocatively. Lagerfeld is the merchandise,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe designer \u2013 who a year earlier told CNN\u2019s Alina Cho, \u201cI\u2019m a walking label. My name is Labelfeld not Lagerfeld\u201d \u2013 shrugged off the piece by slating Newsweek editor Tina Brown and dismissing the magazine. Lagerfeld, who grew up in rural northern Germany, was schooled by a much more ferocious challenger in the form of his equally acerbic mother, Elisabeth Lagerfeldt, whom he idolised. Indeed, a gold-embroidered black velvet Tyrolean suit was his favourite outfit as a child; when he speaks of his privileged childhood, the designer \u2013 who asked his mother for a valet at the age of four \u2013 gives the impression that he climbed out of the womb dictating the nappies he wanted to wear.\n\nYet some of his style mannerisms could also be linked to a willingness to please Mama. At 14, Lagerfeld was told by his mother, \u201cIf you smoke, you show the hands, and as yours are not beautiful\u2026 you should not\u201d; is it coincidence that he likes to cover his hands with armour-like gloves and rings? Or that, having spoken of his mother\u2019s beautiful white hair, he powders his own locks a shade of snow \u2013 then leaves them uncovered? \u201cI love hats, in a way, but when I was a child, I\u2019d wear Tyrolean hats, and my mother... said to me, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t wear hats. You look like an old dyke\u2019,\u201d Lagerfeld told M Magazine. \u201cDo you say such things to children? She was quite funny, no?\u201d\n\nGhost story\n\nLagerfeld, who is not one for psychoanalysis, claims to \u201chave no human feelings,\u201d yet emotions have certainly played their part in his appearance. It was the loss of \u201cthe man he calls the love of his life\u201d, Parisian dandy Jacques de Bascher (to Aids, in 1989) that led him to pile on the pounds in the \u201990s, according to a 2007 profile in New York Magazine. Another of the designer\u2019s famously Oscar Wilde-style utterings is \u201cmy only ambition in life is to wear size 28 jeans\u201d; he now favours ultra-slim designs by Dior Homme.\n\nLagerfeld likes to move with the times and abhors sartorial sloppiness so, in his twilight years, he favours functionality. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing for men and women: a white shirt, a jean and a jacket \u2013 whatever it is, a blazer, whatever \u2013 these are the three basic things, with a t-shirt. That is what everybody needs, and there\u2019s not even a gender problem,\u201d he says, as he interviews himself, in a video for Net-a-Porter magazine. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say \u2018What you need is a cocktail dress\u2019 \u2013 there aren\u2019t so many cocktails in life any more.\u201d\n\nYet Lagerfeld still lives a princely existence, albeit one founded on hard graft rather than air-kissing, one of his many intriguing contradictions. For all his encyclopaedic historical references, his outlook remains modern and pragmatic. He loves to be surrounded by 1,000 people but also savours his solitary moments, such as his morning ritual of reading, daydreaming and sketching in his 17th-Century style Hilditch & Key nightshirt. To take advantage of both publicity and \u2018me-time\u2019, , Lagerfeld \u2013 who has compared himself to a marionette \u2013 has honed a protective armour for his household name. Like an ornate old castle gate or a beetle\u2019s carapace, his elegant ensembles reveal only glimpses of his flesh and are by no means windows to the soul \u2212and that is how he likes it.\n\nWhen asked, at the end of Lagerfeld Confidential, if there\u2019s anybody who knows the real him, the designer responds, \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult question, as I have played so much on constructing a certain image of myself that I think it\u2019s pretty much impossible, and that is my wish \u2013 even for those that I love deeply, I want it to remain impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not want to be a reality in the lives of others,\u201d he continues. \u201cI want to be like an apparition, that appears and then disappears.\u201d\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."

But regardless of the sausage\u2019s fame, it seems that Germans can\u2019t get enough of the d\u00f6ner kebab.\n\nThe nation of 82 million people consumes two million kebabs a day, according to G\u00fcrsel \u00dclber, spokesman for the Association of Turkish D\u00f6ner Producers in Europe (ATDiD). Safe to say, the thinly sliced meat \u2013 cooked on a vertical spit, wrapped in pita or flatbread and topped with salad \u2013 overrules the sausage-duo as a preferred fast-food option; a prominent symbol of the cultural and economic influence of Turkish immigration on German society.\n\nKadir Nurman and Mehmet Aygun are the two men credited for bringing it to Berlin nearly 50 years ago. Both were part of the Gastarbeiter, a wave of guest workers brought in from Southern and Eastern Europe to boost West Germany\u2019s post-war economy. And that they did, paving the way for a 200,000-strong workforce today.\n\nAlthough there\u2019s a lot of speculation as to the real story \u2013 with Aygun claiming he invented the snack a year before Nurman at his shop, Hasir, in 1971 \u2013 the ATDiD have formally given the honour to Nurman.\n\nAccording to \u00dclber, Nurman sold Germany\u2019s first d\u00f6ner kebab from his little stall across from Bahnhof Zoo in West Berlin back in 1972. What was traditionally grilled meat served with rice, salad and pita was transformed into a sandwich for hard-working and busy Germans to eat on the go, with both men claiming to have had the idea to put the meat inside the pita bread.\n\nBut irrespective of who first took the reins, both men set the foundation for what is today a \u20ac4bn trade in Germany, turning over a whopping 400 tonnes of meat a day and helping turn this much-loved street snack into a major staple of the German diet.\n\nATDiD reveals there are around 40,000 kebab shops across Germany, with Berlin leading the pack at 4,000, astonishingly more than Turkey\u2019s most populous city, Istanbul, according to Visit Berlin. The German capital is closely followed by Munich, Frankfurt, Hamburg and Stuttgart.\n\nThere are around 40,000 kebab shops across Germany, with Berlin leading the pack at 4,000, astonishingly more than Turkey\u2019s most populous city, Istanbul.\n\nThe street-food snack so beloved that in 2011 a clever bunch of German university students even created a solution to \u201ckebab breath\u201d: Papa Turk is a drink made from ginger, parsley, mint and lemon that is claimed to neutralise the garlicky aftertaste.\n\nBut why is it so popular?\n\n\u201cBecause it tastes so good,\u201d as \u00dclber simply put it. \u201cIn your hand, you hold all the good ingredients. You have good protein and salads.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the taste, large portions or affordability \u2013 costing anywhere between \u20ac4.50 to \u20ac14. What seems to have struck a chord is the ease with which it can be adapted.\n\nNurman\u2019s creation involved only beef. But over time and due to the availability of different meats, the d\u00f6ner took a new turn to include chicken, lamb and turkey as well as different breads and extra toppings. Every eatery adds its own touch.\n\n\u201cVariations like iskender kebab (thinly cut grilled lamb, tomato sauce, pita bread, melted sheep butter and yogurt), adana kebab (hand-minced meat kebab mounted on a wide iron skewer) and koefte (a meatball including parsley and mint) have also become popular with customers,\u201d said Evren Demircan, co-owner of World of Kebap in Stuttgart.\n\nBut it is the classic beef d\u00f6ner that has got Demircan\u2019s customers hooked. He sells about 500 a week. On weekends that doubles.\n\nTo find out what all the fuss was about, I headed to Germany, where I quickly realized how wrong I was to consider it just a late-night snack for hungover party-goers.\n\nAs I walked through the Frankfurt\u2019s thriving financial district, I was amazed to see just how many choices there were for eating it, from fancy restaurants to little cafes fitted with beautiful Turkish d\u00e9cor. As the lunch-time rush kicked in on a busy Friday afternoon, locals, business people and tourists alike flocked to their nearest kebab eatery, happily waiting in long lines for a satisfying feed.\n\nWhile some opted for mixed grilled plates or koefte, I went straight for the serious stuff: a large beef d\u00f6ner at Nazar Kebap Haus (Sch\u00e4fergasse 38). As I gripped the pita and took my first bite, the chilli sauce and yoghurt-garlic dressing oozed from the bottom. It was amazingly fresh and flavoursome, with the combination of juicy meat, sauces and crunchy salad definitely living up to the hype.\n\nIt seemed to me that the Turks have been hugely successful in managing to keep the dish\u2019s legacy alive while also adapting it to the competitive and ever-evolving food world. And as the largest ethnic group of non-German origin in the country (Berlin boasts the largest Turkish community outside Turkey) their d\u00f6ner kebab has served as an important vehicle in not only servicing the economy and satisfying locals, but has helped forge a bond between the two cultures.\n\nFor many Turkish immigrants, the d\u00f6ner has come to represent opportunity. And even after nearly five decades, with different generations keeping the d\u00f6ner legacy alive, the pioneers are never forgotten.\n\n\u201cOf course, we thank Kadir and Mehmet. Not only did they invent the kebab but they laid the groundwork for the whole industry and in turn many people\u2019s livelihood,\u201d Demircan said. \u201cMany industries have profited from the d\u00f6ner trade.\u201d\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "text": "Streaming is the most popular way people listen to music, but old formats like cassettes and vinyl have both seen an increase in sales in recent years. In fact, vinyl has seen a remarkable sales increase of 1,427% since 2007, selling around around four million LPs in 2018 in the UK alone. Since the popularity of vinyl shows no signs of stopping soon, this means that more non-recyclable discs will be manufactured \u2013 which could have a negative impact on the environment.\n\nAlthough album covers are generally made of recyclable cardboard, records were originally made of shellac, before non-recyclable vinyl was used as a replacement. Shellac is a natural resin secreted by the female Kerria lacca bug, which was scraped from trees to produce gramophone records. Since shellac isn\u2019t derived from fossil fuels, its carbon footprint was lower than that of modern records.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 The key to unlocking lost languages\n\n\u2022 The musicians without ears\n\n\u2022 What single word defines who you are?\n\nShellac records were brittle and prone to damage from water and alcohol though, so PVC plastic records were developed as a more durable alternative. In ideal conditions, with low oxygen and without movement, discarded PVC is likely to take centuries to decompose. The environmental conditions of most landfill sites \u2013 which have varying soil acidity and temperatures \u2013 can cause discarded PVC albums to leach plasticisers (solvents added to plastics to make them more flexible and resilient). They may even outlive the site itself or escape into the environment as pollutants.\n\nModern records typically contain around 135g of PVC material with a carbon footprint of 0.5kg of carbon dioxide (based on 3.4kg of CO\u2082 per 1kg of PVC). Sales of 4.1m records would produce 1.9 thousand tonnes of CO\u2082 \u2013 not taking transport and packaging into account. That is the entire carbon footprint of almost 400 people per year.\n\nIn the 80s, records were replaced by CDs, which promised durability and better sound quality. CDs are made of layered polycarbonate and aluminium, which has slightly less environmental impact than PVC, and are manufactured using less materials than records. However, CDs can\u2019t be recycled because they\u2019re made of mixed materials, which are difficult and uneconomical to separate into their component parts for recycling. CDs were also encased in fragile polycarbonate cases, which, despite being a single material, aren\u2019t widely recycled. They also aren\u2019t as indestructible as many people first thought, so scratched and damaged disks often ended up in landfills.\n\nWhile high-quality CDs could last for 50 to 100 years under ideal conditions, this isn\u2019t true for many low-quality, cheap CDs\n\nWhile high-quality CDs could last for 50 to 100 years under ideal conditions, this isn\u2019t true for many low-quality, cheap CDs. These were easily damaged by direct exposure to sunlight and heat, warped by fast-changing temperatures, gravity, scratches, fingerprints and smudges \u2013 subsequently resulting in them getting thrown out.\n\nCurrent digital technology, however, gives us flawless music quality without physical deterioration. Music is easy to copy and upload, and can be streamed online without downloading. Since our digital music is less tangible than vinyl or CDs, surely it must be more environmentally friendly?\n\nEven though new formats are material-free, that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have an environmental impact. The electronic files we download are stored on active, cooled servers. The information is then retrieved and transmitted across the network to a router, which is transferred by wi-fi to our electronic devices. This happens every time we stream a track, which costs energy.\n\nOnce vinyl or a CD is purchased, it can be played over and over again, the only carbon cost coming from running the record player. However, if we listen to our streamed music using a hi-fi sound system it\u2019s estimated to use 107 kilowatt hours of electricity a year, costing about \u00a315.00 to run. A CD player uses 34.7 kilowatt hours a year and costs \u00a35 to run.\n\nIf you only listen to a track a couple of times, then streaming is the best option, if you listen repeatedly, a physical copy is best\n\nSo, which is the greener option? It depends on many things, including how many times you listen to your music. If you only listen to a track a couple of times, then streaming is the best option. If you listen repeatedly, a physical copy is best \u2013 streaming an album over the internet more than 27 times will likely use more energy than it takes to produce and manufacture a CD.\n\nIf you want to reduce your impact on the environment, then vintage vinyl could be a great physical option. For online music, local storage on phones, computers or local network drives keeps the data closer to the user and will reduce the need for streaming over distance from remote severs across a power-hungry network.\n\nIn a world where more and more of our economy and social relations happen online, records, and other vintage music formats, buck that trend. Instead, the record revival shows us what we want to see in our media and material world more widely \u2013 experiences that hold their value and, with loving care, endure. Older music formats have a sense of importance and permanence attached to them, belonging to us in a way that our virtual purchases simply don\u2019t.\n\nIt seems that whatever the format, owning copies of our favourite and most treasured music, and playing them over and over again, might just be the best option for our environment.\n\n* Sharon George is a lecturer in environmental science and Deirdre McKay is a reader in geography and environmental politics, both at Keele University.

My wife took me to the out-of-hours doctor that night and by this point I was really unwell and could barely move. But I was given an anti-sickness injection and then I was sent home.\"\n\nHours later he collapsed. He was taken to hospital and suffered two cardiac arrests. His body went into shock with the sepsis and his organs started to shut down.\n\nAfter eight days in a coma, Ryan woke up and made an almost complete recovery.\n\n\"No-one mentioned sepsis, although looking back I had all the symptoms,\" said Ryan.\n\n\"It's hard to diagnose, so if this test had been around it could have made all the difference to what happened with me.\"\n\nThe UK Sepsis Trust estimates that earlier diagnosis and treatment across the UK would save at least 14,000 lives a year.\n\nDr Ron Daniels, the trust's chief executive officer, said: \"Any kind of test that enables us to identify sepsis earlier, before symptoms even present themselves, could help save even more lives and bring us closer to our goal of ending preventable deaths from sepsis.\n\n\"Systems like this are so important as, with every hour before the right antibiotics are administered, risk of death increases.\n\n\"No test is perfect in the identification of sepsis, so it's crucial we continue to educate clinicians to think sepsis in order to prompt them to use such tests.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Rachel Day was a healthy, happy 29-year-old when she was struck down by sepsis\n\nUpdate 19 February 2019: This article has been amended to more accurately reflect the stage of development that this new rapid test has reached and the continuing difficulties in diagnosing sepsis."

The very existence of money, along with complex business and distribution channels, acts as a buffer between ourselves and the origin of our products. This can make us behave in ways that are deeply unethical.\n\nI can prove it to you. Do you think animal torture is evil? And do you also eat factory-farmed meat? Many people who would strongly disagree, in principle, with animal cruelty also eat meat that has been raised in terrible conditions.\n\nI know this myself. I try to eat a mostly plant-based diet, but like the majority of people in most Western countries, I do not eat this diet exclusively.\n\nBy reframing the same issue and adding a price tag we make some acts seem far less offensive. We can\u2019t see them first hand, so they feel like they are unrelated to us. All we can see is the price.\n\nWhy? When we understand why we eat meat that we know has been raised in poor conditions, we can begin to understand many other forms of behaviour that conflict with deeply held moral principles.\n\nInternal conflict\n\nAccording to psychologists Brock Bastian and Steve Loughnan, who do research on the topic in Australia, the \u201cmeat paradox\u201d is the \u201cpsychological conflict between people\u2019s dietary preference for meat and their moral response to animal suffering\u201d. They argue that \u201cbringing harm to others is inconsistent with a view of oneself as a moral person. As such, meat consumption leads to negative effects for meat-eaters because they are confronted with a view of themselves that is unfavourable: how can I be a good person and also eat meat?\u201d\n\nThis moral conflict doesn\u2019t just threaten our enjoyment of eating meat, it threatens our identity. In order to protect our identities we establish habits and social structures that make us feel better. Meat-eating is tied to social customs, so that holidays are defined as a time to feast on flesh with friends and family. Some people may also use it as a signal of masculinity, claiming that it helps define someone as a real man, or that we humans evolved as super-predators who were meant to eat meat. And despite animal products being linked to all kinds of poor health outcomes, some people tsk when we say that we want to go vegan (\u201cHow will you get enough protein?\u201d), and friends start \"forgetting\" to invite us to dinner parties.\n\nWith many decisions, including the choice to eat meat, the excuses we make are largely post hoc \u2013 after we have chosen to indulge we need to justify why the behaviour was OK, and why it is OK to do it again. And we need the excuses, or else we feel like bad people.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\n\nWhen we say one thing but do another, or hold inconsistent beliefs, psychologists call it cognitive dissonance. The term was developed by Leon Festinger, who first used it in 1957. The classic experiment in this field was published by Festinger and James Carlsmith in 1959. In it, they asked: \u201cWhat happens to a person\u2019s private opinion if he is forced to do or say something contrary to that opinion?\u201d In their experiment, they had 71 men complete two tasks. First, the men were asked to put 12 round wooden spools into a tray, empty the tray and put the spools back in the tray, repeatedly, for half an hour.\n\nThen the participants were given a board containing 48 square wooden pegs. They were asked to turn each peg by a quarter turn clockwise, then another quarter turn, repeatedly, again for half an hour. While they did this, a researcher watched and wrote things down. These were intentionally boring tasks. Really, really boring.\n\nAlthough the participants thought it was their performance that was being measured, it was actually what came next that interested the researchers. After their two boring tasks, participants were taken back into the waiting room. They were told that the person sitting there was the next participant. For one-third of the participants, they simply sat down without anything else being mentioned. For the other two-thirds, however, the researcher asked whether they would lie to the next participant. They would even be paid for their lie. Half were told that they would be paid $1 for their lie, and the other half were told that they would be paid $20 for their lie (which in the 1950s was a lot). When they said yes, the researcher then handed them a piece of paper, and instructed them to make the points that were written on it: \u201cIt was very enjoyable\u201d, \u201cI had a lot of fun\u201d, \u201cI enjoyed myself\u201d, \u201cIt was very interesting\u201d, \u201cIt was intriguing\u201d, \u201cIt was exciting\u201d.\n\nWhat the researchers really wanted to know was what impact this lie, and the compensation for it, would have on participants\u2019 rating of the task. They wondered whether participants would actually come to think they enjoyed the boring task, just because they told someone else it was fun. And how would being paid influence this?\n\nWho do you think rated the experiment as the most enjoyable? The control group, who had not been asked to lie, rated the task as boring and said that they would not do it again. The participants paid $20 also rated the task negatively. However, the participants paid $1 rated the experiment as far more enjoyable than the other two groups, and were more likely to say they would sign up to participate in similar experiments in the future.\n\nWhat happened? Being paid $1 was probably not seen by the participants as sufficient incentive to lie. Accordingly, they experienced cognitive dissonance. \u201cWhy did I say that it was enjoyable when it wasn\u2019t? Surely not for a measly $1?\u201d Since the participants could not go back and change their behaviour, or un-participate in the experiment, the option available to them was to change their belief \u2013 it must have actually been enjoyable.For the $20 condition this was not necessary, as they could explain their behaviour as the result of the hefty and easy financial incentive. This was the first of many experiments to show that we often bring our beliefs in line with our behaviour, and that money can change the way we do this.\n\nIn 1962 Festinger further formalised his ideas. He stated that although we believe ourselves to be generally consistent \u2013 in our behaviours, beliefs and attitudes \u2013 sometimes we go rogue. This inconsistency he called dissonance, while consistency he called consonance. He summarised his cognitive dissonance theory as follows:\n\nThe existence of dissonance, being psychologically uncomfortable, will motivate the person to try to reduce the dissonance and achieve consonance. When dissonance is present, in addition to trying to reduce it, the person will actively avoid situations and information which would likely increase the dissonance.\n\nDissonance in pretty packaging\n\nHe further explained that, just as hunger motivates us to find food to reduce our hunger, cognitive dissonance motivates us to find situations to reduce the dissonance. For meat-eating, there are two ways to do this: we can change our behaviour or change the belief. We can stop eating meat, or come up with reasons why eating meat is morally OK.\n\nIn addition to our own attempts to justify meat-eating, advertising and marketing can make it easier for us to do so. According to research by sociologist Liz Grauerholz on images of animals in popular culture, one way to make meat-eating seem acceptable is to dissociate it from the animal it came from. Grauerholz argues that we do this by \u201ctransforming animals, which are loved, into meats, which are eaten, so that the concepts of \u2018animals\u2019 and \u2018meats\u2019 seem distinct and unrelated\u201d. We call it \u201cveal\u201d instead of baby cow, \u201cham\u201d instead of pig, \u201cgame\u201d instead of hunted wild animal. We pack our dead animals in pretty packages \u2013 physically, verbally and conceptually distancing ourselves from the real origin of our food.\n\nWhen looking at commercial depictions of meat, she found that this was done in two different ways. The first was showing meat as sanitised, plastic-wrapped, chopped into pieces \u2013 making it hard to think that it came from an animal at all. The second had to do with \u2018cutification\u2019 \u2013 making the animals cuter than they actually are. More than anywhere, this is adopted as a strategy in parts of Asia such as Japan. Adverts there use what ethologist Konrad Lorenz referred to as the Kindchenschema (\u201cbaby schema\u201d) \u2013 big eyes, petite, round features, like we might expect in children\u2019s books. It\u2019s meant to give the impression that this meat comes from happy, imaginary animals. Both of these serve to distract from the realities of animal cruelty.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just relevant for meat-eating. When we turn animals or humans into objects, and thereby avoid the discomfort caused by knowing about the suffering behind consumer goods, we make it easier to be cruel. The same processes we see with meat, we see with all kinds of other morally unacceptable but common human behaviours that have to do with money.\n\nWe know that poverty causes great suffering, yet instead of sharing our wealth we buy another pair of expensive shoes. We fundamentally disagree with the idea of child labour or adults working under horrible conditions, but keep shopping at discount stores. We stay in the dark, to protect our delicate identities, to maintain the illusion that we are consistent and ethically sensible human beings.\n\nIn this constant effort to reduce cognitive dissonance, we may spread morally questionable behaviour to others. We begin to shape societies in ways to minimise our discomfort, to not remind us of our inconsistencies. We don\u2019t want constant reminders. And, as Bastian and Loughnan argue, \u201cthrough the process of dissonance reduction, the apparent immorality of certain behaviours can seemingly disappear.\u201d\n\nHypocrisy can flourish in certain social and cultural environments. Social habits can cast a veil over our moral conflicts, by normalising behaviours and making them invisible and resistant to change.\n\nIt is time for a revolution in how we talk about human beings, animals and the planet, and acknowledge our own hypocrisies. Rather than doing mental gymnastics to justify unethical behaviour, we must consider actually changing it. Identifying and addressing even just a few of your guilt-ridden ethical inconsistencies is likely to make you a happier person, and the planet a better place.\n\n--\n\nThis text has been adapted from Evil: The Science Behind Humanity\u2019s Dark Side, by Dr Julia Shaw, a psychological scientist at University College London.\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "text": "For many expats, finding new friends can ease the often overwhelming task of adjusting to a new life abroad. But with huge variances in local culture and language capabilities, some places can definitely feel more welcoming than others.\n\nTo determine where expats might find the best success of fitting in fast, global community network InterNations recently conducted their annual Expat Insider survey of more than 14,000 expats from 191 countries, asking residents to rate a number of aspects about life abroad, including how easy it was to settle in, a country\u2019s friendliness and ease of making friends.\n\nWe talked to residents in the countries ranked high for friendliness to find out what makes these places so hospitable to newcomers.\n\nUganda\n\nThis East African country received the highest marks for friendliness. According to the InterNations report, 57% of expats in Uganda gave \u2018general friendliness\u2019 the best possible rating (the global average was 26%). Not only that, not a single respondent ranked this factor negatively.\n\nCharlotte Beauvoisin, a British expat who writes about living in the capital Kampala at Diary of a Muzungu, said that welcoming all nationalities is an intrinsic part of the culture, and residents are quick to offer smiles to newcomers.\n\nInterNations Ambassador Nadya Mileva, originally from Bulgaria and now living in Kampala, agrees, saying that the people are \u2018amazingly friendly\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe country has a lot to offer, from breathtaking landscapes to high-end restaurants and bars to year-round summer,\u201d she added.\n\nUganda isn\u2019t without its problems, however, including its draconian stance on homosexuality, power outages and infrastructure growing pains that can make traffic come to a complete standstill. But \u201cthe overwhelming majority of visitors to Uganda love the place. Many of us extend our contracts; many of us decide to settle here,\u201d Beauvoisin said.\n\nThe majority of expats live in Kampala, where English is common and international restaurants abound.\n\n\u201cIt has a high-energy core with a relaxed periphery well suited for families and others who prefer to stay at home,\u201d Mileva said. While the southern half of the city is culturally diverse and less expensive, with easy access to Lake Victoria and the airport, the northern half is home to more affluent neighbourhoods. But expats live everywhere.\n\n\u201cThere are not neighbourhoods predominated by mazungus [foreigners] and others only for Ugandans,\u201d Mileva explained.\n\nThe country is also very affordable for food and labour \u2013 meaning that expats are usually able to maintain a high standard of living.\n\nCosta Rica\n\nThe Central American country ranks high across all factors when it comes to how easily expats fit in. Almost nine out of 10 expats (89%) are pleased with the general friendliness of the population, and eight out of 10 (79%) feel at home, according to the survey.\n\nForeign- or native-born, the community is connected by the \u2018pura vida\u2019 sensibility, said Diana Stobo, owner of The Retreat Costa Rica. \u201cThe idea of living a \u2018pure life\u2019 is the promise here, and those who are tired of the hustle and bustle want to live that way.\u201d\n\nShe believes the socialist government plays a part in maintaining this equality and openness. \u201cPeople all live within the same means; it is difficult to get ahead financially, and therefore most find peace and harmony in what they have. No sweat, no worries, no problems, just \u2018pura vida\u2019.\u201d\n\nWhile English is widely spoken, learning Spanish will get you far with the locals, said David Black, an InterNations Ambassador who lives in Santa Ana, 15km west of the capital San Jose, and is originally from the UK.\n\n\u201cIf you make an effort to understand and embrace the Costa Rican culture, you are very much welcomed with open arms and considered a friend.\u201d\n\nWhile expat retirees flock to beach locations like Guancaste in the northwest and Jacro and Manuel Antonio, both in the central west, many professional expats live in the Central Valley near San Jose.\n\n\u201cSanta Ana and Escazu [8km west of San Jose] are very popular with North Americans and Europeans in particular,\u201d Jones said.\n\nThe cost of living in Costa Rica has increased in the past 10 years, with Jones noting that a cup of coffee and a cake can cost just as much as in central London in some places. \u201cHowever, like most other places, if you know where to look and wish to survive on a modest budget, there are still plenty of local places where you can eat and shop at a reasonable cost,\u201d he said.\n\nColombia\n\nThis South American hotspot feels like home fast, according to many expats.\n\n\u201cThe Colombian people are eager to show their country in a positive light and are very receptive and hospitable towards newcomers,\u201d said Anne Marie Zwerg-Villegas, an InterNations Medell\u00edn Ambassador living in Chia (a suburb north of Bogot\u00e1) and originally from the US.\n\n\u201cColombia is one of the countries in the world with the lowest percentage of foreign-born residents, so we are a novelty. Locals tend to think of us as tourists and treat us as tourists.\u201d\n\nWilliam Duran, who lives in Medell\u00edn, Colombia\u2019s second largest city, where he hosts a digital nomad bootcamp, says this gives expats a unique opportunity to feel immediately welcomed, without the shine wearing off. \u201cOut of the 40-plus countries I have been to, there is no other place where I've seen foreigners feel such a great balance of familiarity and novelty,\u201d he said. \u201cColombians are very helpful and cheerful. The country is warm in every sense of the word.\u201d\n\nMost expats live in Bogot\u00e1, the metropolitan capital with nearly 8 million residents. Since traffic in the city is \u2018horrendous\u2019, according to Zwerg-Villegas, it pays to live close to your office. Most professional expats live in the northeast quadrant of the city, in neighbourhoods such as Chic\u00f3, Rosales, Usaqu\u00e9n and Cedritos.\n\n\u201cThese neighbourhoods have modern commercial centres with international brands, restaurants with a variety of ethnic cuisine, and social and athletic clubs. Exclusive nightlife spots like Parque 93, Zona T and Zona G are also in these neighbourhoods,\u201d Zwerg-Villegas said.\n\nYounger and more adventurous expats might consider parts of the city further south like Teusaquillo or Soledad, where craft beer bars and inexpensive nightclubs are everywhere.\n\nSince Colombia is an agricultural economy, fresh fruit and vegetables are available year round at affordable prices, and services are cheap too.\n\n\u201cMost expats will easily afford a maid, a driver and a nanny,\u201d Zwerg-Villegas said. That said, expat incomes usually qualify as upper-middle class, which means a surcharge on utilities is levied to support the lower income earners.\n\nOman\n\nAs one of the sunniest countries in the world, Oman also has friendly residents who reflect the warm climate. A welcoming culture rooted in faith also leads to an openness with newcomers.\n\n\u201cTraditionally speaking, Omanis are very hospitable to strangers. With their strong Islamic background and belief, they love to help their neighbours or those in need, and will easily bring a stranger or new person into their home for coffee or dates or fruit,\u201d said Nicole Brewer, who lives in Nizwa (160 km south of the capital of Muscat) and blogs about her experience at I Love to Globetrot.\n\nThe country is known for outdoor living and adventures, with great weather, camping and adventure spots.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t consider moving to Oman for the city life,\u201d warned Rebecca Mayston, an InterNations Ambassador originally from New Zealand who lives in Muscat. \u201cMove here with an open mind for outdoor experiences. For me, the life is endless adventures, amazing weather and landscapes, diverse nationalities and friendships.\u201d\n\nMuscat has more bars and restaurants than any other city in Oman, and Mayston says many of her expat friends enjoy clubbing here on the weekends. Nizwa has more of a small-town feel, even though it used to be the capital of the country, but has plenty of history, including the Nizwa Fort and its famous souq, a shopping district filled with gems and pottery.\n\nWhile the cost of living in Oman is growing more expensive, it was recently ranked by Mercer as one of the more affordable places to live in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cFor me, I can live a better life here than I do back home, and still get ahead with financial benefits,\u201d Mayston said.\n\nThe Philippines\n\nThis island nation has become an outsourcing capital with many multinational companies opening offices here and attracting expats from across the world. Currently, residents of 159 countries do not need even need a visa to enter the Philippines.\n\nEnglish is a primary language and residents are eager to welcome newcomers.\n\n\u201cLocals are very outgoing and helpful, which makes foreigners feels accommodated,\u201d said Eleanor Webley, a Manila native and InterNations Ambassador.\n\nThere\u2019s also a strong culture of going out \u2013 to festivals and parties, or even just getting outdoors \u2013 which means newcomers can easily find opportunities to meet new friends.\n\n\u201cThe people here are very friendly and are always smiling,\u201d said Wendell Yuson, an InterNations Ambassador who was born and raised in Manila, adding that the slogan of the Philippine Department of Tourism also reflects this vibe: \u2018It\u2019s more fun in the Philippines!\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile most expats work in Manila, many choose to make their home near the country\u2019s beautiful beaches. Tagaytay, 66km south of Manila, is a popular location for expats who want to be out of the fray, but still within reach via public transportation (buses connect the cities).\n\n\u201cThe Philippines has 7,100 islands, and expats love the tropical lifestyle here,\u201d Yuson said. Those who prefer city living usually stay in the Central Business Districts (including Makati, the primary and largest CBD; the newest district Bonifacio Global City; and centrally located Ortigas Center in Manila) or live in Cebu, the second city of the country located in the central islands.\n\nThe cost of living here is generally not high, and budget-minded expats can easily make ends meet, with costs in Manila about 60% less expensive than London in housing, transportation and food, according to Expatistan.com. Still, living in high-end districts or using serviced apartments, where residents enjoy hotel-level amenities and services, can push costs up substantially.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: A previous version of this story stated that Tagaytay was an island; it is a city.

    "text": "The origins of the Kendal mint cake date to prehistoric times, when unique geological conditions created sweet, marble-like deposits in the caverns of England\u2019s Lake District. Local miners armed with pickaxes risk their lives to carve out this valuable foodstuff.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s the fictional, tongue-in-cheek version related by Colin Bowden. Along with his wife Margot, he runs a shop called The Mintcake Mine in Bowness-on-Windermere, a picturesque Lake District town. As well as selling the delicacy, the shop houses a tiny exhibition on the mint-cake myth \u2013 complete with pickaxes and a helmet belonging to the so-called mint-cake miners.\n\nThe real story of Kendal mint cake is no less interesting.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 The English moor where wallabies roam\n\n\u2022 The cake that comes with a warning\n\n\u2022 The mystery of England\u2019s ancient tunnels\n\nThe treat was created by accident in 1869 in the nearby market town of Kendal. Confectioner Joseph Wiper was in the process of making mints. During a bout of inattention, the sugary mixture started to solidify and turn cloudy. The Kendal mint cake \u2013 more of a bar than a floury cake, eaten more frequently by hikers looking for a glucose boost than diners in the mood for dessert \u2013 was born.\n\nToday, the product remains simple, made of sugar, glucose syrup, water and peppermint oil. The oldest existing manufacturer of Kendal mint cake, Quiggins, adds salt.\n\nSimple or not, the mint cake has played an outsized role in mountaineering history. In 1953, Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay ate it on their attempt to be the first team to ascend Mt Everest.\n\nThe expedition manager responsible for their provisions had read about Kendal mint cake in a climbing magazine. In 1952 he wrote to Romney\u2019s, one of the bar\u2019s main manufacturers to this day, to request 38lb (17kg) of brown mint cake, a version made with brown sugar. He had never tried the product himself, but as his letter says, \"Experience thas [sic] shown this to be an excellent High Altitude food\".\n\nThis was seven years after the end of World War II, when the UK was still subject to food rationing. As a result, Romney\u2019s had to make a special request for additional sugar, which was granted.\n\nHillary and Norgay became the first confirmed people to summit Mt Everest. As for the mint cake, one member of the expedition wrote, \"It was easily the most popular item on our high altitude ration \u2013 our only criticism was that we did not have enough of it.\"\n\nKendal mint cake continues to be popular with climbers, cyclists and runners as a portable, durable source of energy. Emma Stevenson, a professor of sport and exercise science at Newcastle University, explained, \u201cIt is high in glucose and therefore is rapidly digested when consumed, and so is a quick source of energy. This is why it is popular on walks etc.\u201d\n\nKendal mint cake has been called the world\u2019s first energy bar. The sugar content is particularly useful at high altitudes, where the body craves sugar and finds other types of food hard to digest. The strong mint flavour is also appropriate, as high altitudes dull taste buds.\n\nMore than 60 years after the summiting of Everest, the making of Kendal mint cake remains largely unchanged.\n\nFor one thing, it\u2019s still a family affair in at least one mint cake-producing company. John Barron, the current managing director of Romney\u2019s, is the fourth generation of the family to run the business. As a child, he worked in the factory on school holidays. He operates Romney\u2019s with his wife, Paula, and her brother. The Barrons hope that their two sons will take over the business someday. Regardless, they won\u2019t entertain ideas about selling it. \u201cIt\u2019s security for our family and future generations,\u201d Paula said.\n\nFounded in 1914, Romney\u2019s has also retained much of the original production process. The factory happens to be located on Mintsfeet Road North, near the foot of the River Mint. (Amazingly, there\u2019s no connection between these names and the treat.)\n\nArriving at Romney\u2019s, a minty smell wafts over the unassuming industrial estate that surrounds it. Once inside, the scent is powerful. The factory is smaller than you might expect: just three small rooms. The Barrons are nervous about expanding: getting too big \u201cwouldn\u2019t give us that quality of life and that enjoyment,\u201d said Paula.\n\nThe actual production is confined to one room. First, a large vat heats up and mixes the sugar with glucose and water. The next steps are done by hand. The sugar mixture is poured into copper pans nearly a century old. Factory workers add essence of peppermint and mix this in a process known as \u2018graining\u2019, which helps the compound achieve its distinctive cloudy appearance. Employees then ladle the concoction into silicone moulds in a variety of sizes and shapes. These moulds have perforations for easy splitting of the sheets.\n\nIt takes up to 30 minutes for the cake to turn solid; the staff can tell at a glance, by the texture and colour, whether it\u2019s ready. They break the cake into bars and weigh them. The bars then go to the other rooms of the factory, where they\u2019re wrapped, packed and stacked for distribution.\n\nKendal mint cake isn\u2019t for everyone. It\u2019s intensely minty \u2013 to the point that you\u2019ll continue to taste the herb well after you\u2019ve swallowed the cake. (The chocolate-covered version helps to temper the mintiness.) For intrepid souls only, there\u2019s even an extra-strong version. This is one cake that\u2019s less dessert than fuel, functional rather than gourmet.\n\nOutdoorsy pursuits like climbing are a good fit for the Lake District, a scenic part of north-west England, in the county of Cumbria, known for its 16 main lakes, mountainous terrain and literary heritage (it inspired the likes of William Wordsworth and Beatrix Potter). In July 2017, Unesco named the Lake District a World Heritage Site, a status bound to increase tourism to the already much-visited region.\n\nThe Lake District remains proud of its home-grown product, and Kendal mint cake can be found just about everywhere in Kendal. It retains an old-fashioned reputation, but that\u2019s key to its appeal to tourists and locals alike. \u201cIt\u2019s not changed,\u201d said Paula. \u201cIt\u2019s still made by hand.\u201d\n\nWhatever the future of tourism for the Lake District, and for Kendal in particular, it\u2019s clear that a mint-flavoured bar beloved of mountaineers will long continue to be associated with it.\n\nThis story is a part of BBC Britain \u2013 a series focused on exploring this extraordinary island, one story at a time.

    "text": "Have you ever explained issues you have with your partner to your friends, only for them to think they are not worth worrying about? Or have you seen a friend start a new romance with someone you think is completely unsuitable but they seem to go from strength to strength?\n\nPsychologists have found two scales that influence how we start and maintain relationships.\n\nOne measures how much importance we put onto first impressions and early signs of compatibility, while the other measures how likely we are to work through problems in relationships. They are called implicit theories of relationships (because we don\u2019t often talk about them). We might intuitively think of ourselves as more or less likely to believe in true love \u2013 but this is not something that we openly discuss with others or are conscious of when we start new relationships.\n\nTogether, these two scales can tell us if we are more likely to avoid talking about issues with our partners, look for faults where they might not exist, and \u2018ghost\u2019 our way out of relationships. Differences in these implicit attitudes can also help us understand the reasons that others\u2019 romantic choices often seem inexplicable to us.\n\nTo find out how you score, take the two quizzes below.\n\nThe Soul Mate scale\n\nAnswer the following questions on a scale of one to seven, where one is strongly disagree and seven is strongly agree.\n\n1. Success in a romantic relationship is based mostly on whether the people are \u201cright\u201d for each other.\n\n2. There is a person out there who is perfect (or close to perfect) for me.\n\n3. In marriages, many people discover (vs. build) a deep intimate connection to their spouse.\n\n4. It is extremely important that my spouse and I be passionately in love with each other after we are married.\n\n5. I couldn't marry someone unless I was passionately in love with him or her.\n\n6. There is no such thing as \"Mr. Right\" or \"Ms. Right\".\n\n7. I expect my future husband or wife to be the most amazing person I have ever met.\n\n8. People who are searching for a perfect match are wasting their time.\n\n9. The reason most marriages fail is that people aren\u2019t right for each other.\n\n10. Bonds between people are usually there before you meet them.\n\nNow for scoring. First add your answers for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 and 10. For questions 6 and 8, you need to subtract each answer from the number 8 and use the new number as your answer for that question. For example, if you answered \u201c6\u201d, add a 2 to your total. Once you have your final total, divide by 10 to get your average for this scale.\n\nThe Work-it-out scale\n\nAnswer the following questions on a scale of one to seven, where one is strongly disagree and seven is strongly agree.\n\n1. Success in a romantic relationship is based mostly on how much people try to make the relationship work.\n\n2. In marriage, effort is more important than compatibility.\n\n3. In a relationship, love grows (vs. love is found).\n\n4. If people would just put in the effort, most marriages would work.\n\n5. I could be happily married to most people, if they were reasonable.\n\n6. The reason most marriages fail is that people don\u2019t put in the effort.\n\n7. How well you know someone depends on how long you have known him or her.\n\n8. If I were to marry a random person, I would be satisfied.\n\n9. Only over time can you really learn about your partner.\n\nTo find out your score, add together your answers and divide by 9.\n\nThe questions in this quiz are taken from the Relationship Theories Questionnaire used by Renae Franiuk, of Aurora University, Illinois, in her research into implicit theories and relationship satisfaction and longevity. Franiuk uses \u2018Soulmate\u2019 and \u2018Work-it-out\u2019 to describe the two scales. Other researchers use \u2018destiny\u2019 and \u2018growth\u2019 to describe similar scales.\n\nIf you scored highly for \u2018soulmate\u2019 beliefs and are surprised by this, Franiuk says you won\u2019t be alone. \u201cPeople have a tendency to think they will be a \u2018work-it-out\u2019 type but we see pretty high endorsement for \u2018soulmate\u2019. When we hear about the theories on the surface, \u2018soulmate\u2019 turns people off because it\u2019s not scientific but it\u2019s just a word. We could call it something different to make people want to identify with these romantic beliefs. It\u2019s not surprising that we want to believe these ideas when so much in Western culture pushes people towards them.\u201d\n\nFor people who score well on the growth scales, a conflict can improve the strength of the relationship\n\nNow you have your score, what should you look out for? When relationships are struggling, people who score highly on growth scales cope best. In fact, the presence of a problem to work through can improve the strength of the relationship; couples who score highly on growth scales actually report feeling better about their relationship after a conflict has been worked through. For these people, it might be necessary for small, fairly inconsequential, issues to arise in the relationship to keep the couple focused on working together. The more investments a couple make, the more committed they feel. They enjoy the challenge.\n\nFor these reasons, growth believers will overlook big differences in compatibility. For them, compatibility might become more aligned with time \u2013 and that is something that is worth being worked on.\n\nThe opposite is true for people with strong destiny beliefs, with some potentially toxic consequences.\n\nParticularly in the early stages of a relationship the presence of an issue can precipitate a break-up, as the destiny believer realises that their \u201cperfect\u201d soulmate is fallible. The destiny believer may argue that their partner \u201cnever really understood me\u201d or that a small fault is \u201cevidence that we\u2019re not really compatible.\u201d This is the case even if the couple are relatively well matched, Franiuk has found.\n\nPeople who believe in true love are more likely to \u2018ghost\u2019 their ex-partners\n\nWorse still, they may exit the relationship in a less-than-charitable manner. People who believe in true love are more likely to \u2018ghost\u2019 their ex-partners \u2013 avoiding contact until the other person gives up speaking to you. Perhaps because the ghoster does not feel it is worth the investment to try to maintain the relationship if the other person is not ideal for them and does not see the benefit in providing feedback. \u201cThey don\u2019t see it as a negative thing to do,\u201d says Gili Freedman, a psychologist at St Mary's College of Maryland, who studies social rejection. \u201cYour score on the growth scale had less of an effect overall, although, if you scored highly for growth you were more likely to feel negative about ghosting.\u201d\n\nIf they don\u2019t break up over an issue \u2013 and still believe that they\u2019ve found their true love \u2013 the destiny believer may simply overlook the issue altogether. \u201cDestiny believers tend to be more forgiving of a partner and more likely to avoid a fight because they want to believe that this person is their soulmate,\u201d says Franiuk. That could be positive for minor disagreements. \u201cBut if you\u2019re avoiding big conflict you end up staying with someone who is not good for you.\u201d\n\nAnd the consequences can be extremely serious. Destiny believers who have been together for longer are more likely to overlook issues, fooling themselves into thinking they are a better match because of the amount of time they have been together.\n\n\u201cWe found that the longer destiny theorists stayed in relationships with someone who is not the right person, the more they reported violence,\u201d says Franiuk. \u201cThey downplay problematic relationships. They might give someone a longer chance than other people might. Some might see warning signs early and end the relationships, but there will be some who don\u2019t believe they are in a relationship with the right person but for economic reasons they remain and their personality traits make them more forgiving, which puts them in dangerous situations.\u201d\n\nIt would seem that romantic beliefs remain fixed over time. So, once a destiny believer, always a destiny believer. \u201cThese theories are deeply held. Once people hit their 20s and 30s personalities are pretty stable. Like personality, relationship building is developed at an early age \u2013 children form these ideas based on the relationships around them,\u201d says Franiuk.\n\nThe two implicit theories do not need to be mutually exclusive, though. \u201cYou can have beliefs that relationships improve when couples work on them together, but [still believe] there is still the \u2018right\u2019 person out there for you,\u201d says Freedman. \u201cThere are not going to be many people that think that no growth is possible. And we can still alter the ways we express those beliefs. We would expect that past experiences will shape how we approach new relationships.\u201d So just because you believe in romantic destiny, you might end the relationships in a more compassionate way, rather than ghosting, or you might make a more conscious effort to work through problems rather than overlooking them.\n\nThey say the course of true love never did run smooth \u2013 but a greater awareness of our own romantic tendencies might just help us navigate those bumps and turns along the way.\n\n--\n\nWilliam Park is @williamhpark on Twitter.

    "text": "The swaggering, the aggression, the attitude\u2026headstrong teenagers can be scary. Even more so when they\u2019re eight feet tall and weigh six tonnes.\n\nThe swaggering, the aggression, the attitude\u2026headstrong teenagers can be scary. Even more so when they\u2019re eight feet tall and weigh six tonnes.\n\nWhen Gus Van Dyk was an ecologist at Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa, he was worried by a series of attacks on the park\u2019s rhino. As described in the BBC Earth Podcast, badly mutilated rhino carcasses were discovered, over 50 in all, with wounds to the top of the shoulders and neck, which suggested, worryingly, elephants. Elephant attacks on rhinos are not unknown, and jostles at watering holes are fairly common, but this volume of attacks was unusual. Further investigation by Van Dyk revealed that the suspects were a group of adolescent male elephants (their teenage years are the same as ours \u2013 between 12 and 20 years old) who were clearly experiencing heightened aggression.\n\nThis out of control gang of elephants, between 15 and 18, appeared to be in \u201cmusth\u201d. This is a unique state to elephants, in which young males, usually in their 20s, are flooded with reproductive hormones. They swagger, make themselves look taller, and dribble strongly smelling liquid from temporal glands on either side of their heads, as well as producing a constant stream of urine from their penises. It\u2019s basically a form of \u201chere I am, I\u2019m fit and healthy and looking for a mate\u201d, as well as a promotion in the elephant pecking order.\n\nMusth is a unique state to elephants, in which young males, usually in their 20s, are flooded with reproductive hormones \u00a9 Arindam Bhattacharya/Getty\n\nThe scary part is as well as the urge to mate going into overdrive, the males become very aggressive to the extent that two males in musth will fight to the death, tipping each other over so they can stab their victim with their tusks.\n\nThe normal safeguard is when an elephant in musth encounters a bigger bull elephant, he immediately drops out of musth as he knows his testosterone cannot compete. A young male may only be in musth for a few days. As he ages the length of his musth periods increase until by the time he\u2019s in his forties, he can handle it and his musth period could be weeks.\n\nThese were late adolescent elephants, though, without the experience of operating as a male in a large social group. Van Dyk identified the probable cause; in the late 1970s, Pilanesberg National Park had been seeded with elephants from other national parks, like Kruger. Huge bull elephants were extremely difficult to transport, so young males, females and babies were introduced. As a result, there were no older bull elephants to push these youngsters out of musth. The huge rush of testosterone was overwhelming them and driving them to aggressive behaviour.\n\nVan Dyk realised that musth was the key to stopping this delinquent gang, so the decision was to either control it artificially, castrate the young males or go back to basics and find a natural solution. The answer, he felt, was to put a natural stopper on the musth by introducing big bull elephants.\n\nThe normal safeguard is when an elephant in musth encounters a bigger bull elephant, he immediately drops out of musth as he knows his testosterone cannot compete \u00a9 Vicki Jauron, Babylon and Beyond Photography/Getty\n\nHe was right. Six large bulls were introduced from Kruger National Park, who towered over the adolescents, and literally within hours, the teen thugs had dropped out of musth. No more rhinos have been killed since by rampaging youngsters.\n\nThis musth story was used in an American academic paper as an example in human adolescence of the importance of a stable society and a father figure to provide boundaries for teen males. The young males that were getting into these elephant gangs had no template of good social behaviour and were at the mercy of their rampaging hormones, which was putting them at as much risk as those around them. The result was a happy ending for the elephants in Pilanesberg, and one from which maybe we can learn.\n\nIntroducing the BBC Earth Podcast\n\nBBC Earth presents a podcast the size of a planet, telling stories about nature, science and our human experience.\n\nSubscribe wherever you get your podcasts:\n\nBy Lucy Freeman\n\nFeatured image by Julia Cumes / Aurora Photos / Getty"

    "authors": [
      "Sophie Harris"
    ],
    "text": "\u201cSomebody in Bristol started making a vodka called Novichok,\u201d said our host, Natasha Ward, faux-scandalised at the reference to the toxic nerve agent. \u201cAnd they were immediately told, \u2018Stop it at once!\u2019\u201d She laughed as she finished setting the table for the day\u2019s gathering in her home in South London, introducing the dishes as one might introduce guests at a party. \u201cWe start with herring, salted, not pickled \u2013 English people hate beetroot because they\u2019ve only ever met it in this horrible vinegar, and those rollmop herrings that look like corpses, you know?\u201d\n\nWard is a master of moving between cultures. She\u2019s half-Russian, half-English, and has worked as an interpreter for such diverse parties as the United Nations, Angelina Jolie and Mikhail Gorbachev. Today\u2019s task \u2013 explaining exactly why Russian people might sniff bread while drinking vodka \u2013 may not be quite so starry, but it does offer a portal into the realities of Russian life at a time when sympathetic cultural insight is sorely lacking.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 Why you should never drink whisky on the rocks\n\n\u2022 The dessert you can\u2019t make alone\n\n\u2022 Why Scotland loves haggis\n\nTo armchair observers, relations between Russia and the West currently seem cartoonishly chilly; there was more than a touch of Cold War frost to recent news reports about the Russian and American withdrawal from a nuclear weapons treaty, the Salisbury nerve agent poisonings in the UK and, of course, the 2018 World Cup in Russia.\n\n\u201cWe were happy when the Russian football team finally lost,\u201d said Anna Ivanov, while her husband Misha shrugged. Anna and Misha are the parents of Ward\u2019s best friend, Helena Bayliss, and the couple moved here from Russia 20 years ago when their daughter married an Englishman. \u201cWhen the team were winning, there was so much hot air in everything the media said. The mouth didn\u2019t shut for a moment!\u201d\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d Ward said, \u201cwhich vodka shall we start with?\u201d\n\nThis media cannot be played on your device.\n\nThe choice was impressive, as it should be. Russia, after all, is the birthplace of the chemist Dmitri Mendeleev, who created the Periodic Table and is also said to have perfected the recipe for vodka as strictly 40% proof (a popular myth but a fun story). Accordingly, Ward offered fiery pertsovka vodka made with chillies, plain Russian vodka, vodka made in Newfoundland as part of a new venture by Hollywood actor Dan Aykroyd and homemade limonaya (lemon) vodka. \u201cThis is actually medical alcohol which is 95% proof,\u201d said Ward matter-of-factly, \u201cwhich you then water down, half and half, and add lemon.\u201d Moonshine, in other words? \u201cNo, if it was moonshine we\u2019d have to have a still.\u201d Bayliss started laughing. \u201cNatasha, you disappoint!\u201d\n\nOur little company was assembled for two reasons: firstly, to have a convivial time; and secondly, to get the bottom of the Russian vodka ritual \u2013 a time-honoured tradition that has social drinkers sniffing bread in the name of propriety.\n\nIt\u2019s not something you sip and savour\n\nTo begin, both the vodka and the glasses were retrieved from the freezer, and Bayliss outlined the essentials for drinking vodka, Russian-style. \u201cVodka should be cold, glass should be tiny and there must be something salty, or rye bread, to follow,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in drinking vodka and following it with an eclair, it doesn\u2019t work\u201d. \u201cOr,\u201d added Ward, \u201cGod forbid, following it with nothing!\u201d\n\nThe freezing temperature of the drink is a no-brainer; it sends the shot down the throat more comfortably. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you sip and savour,\u201d Bayliss said. So why do people drink it? Her mother laughed. \u201cWell, the afterwards, the glow!\u201d\n\nThe glow, in fact, is how I first encountered the Russian bread-sniffing ritual. Ward is the mother of my best friend Marsha, and as wayward teenagers, Marsha and I were more than happy to sit in on the gatherings her mother held following her work trips to Russia, the table heaving with exotic booze, salty pickles and black bread. We would watch Ward and her guests laughing, telling tall tales and \u2013 crucially \u2013 munching on snacks immediately after knocking back shots of vodka. When the guests\u2019 appetite had been amply satisfied \u2013 but the toasting continued \u2013 they would give the bread a quick sniff after downing their vodka shot, in place of eating it. We were transfixed.\n\nTwo decades later I saw the ritual again, this time on primetime television. In an episode of Netflix series House of Cards, the Russian president dines with the US president, and he demonstrates how to drink vodka like a Russian \u2013 with sniffs and all. It\u2019s a complicated, theatrical process on the TV show, and not necessarily accurate (\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t do that with a posh guest!\u201d Ward exclaimed), but the sharp inhalation is clearly there. Articles were written in response to the episode, suggesting that bread is sniffed to soak up the alcohol and offset the taste of the vodka, while the salt and acid in Russian pickles \u2013 like the ones on Ward\u2019s table \u2013 help neutralise the alcohol.\n\nBut according to Ward and her friends, the ritual is not merely medicinal, it also serves a social function; by eating or sniffing bread after the shot, you\u2019re demonstrating that you\u2019re not just knocking back vodka to get drunk. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have something to chase the vodka with, like a piece of salty bread or some herring, or, even better, caviar, then you do the sniffing,\u201d Bayliss said. \u201cIt\u2019s symbolic.\u201d\n\nWard agreed: \u201cThe sniffing only happens if you\u2019re too poor to have proper food.\u201d Or, of course, too full. Indeed, if you only had a small amount of bread at a gathering, you\u2019d pass it around the table so that each guest could smell the bread in turn.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t have any bread at all? \u201cYou sniff your sleeve!\u201d\n\nAccordingly, we took the first shot of the party: Misha made a gracious toast, the ice-cold vodka slipped down smoothly and we followed it with a big bite of black bread and butter. Several drinks later, and quite merry, we each tore off a piece of bread and gave it a good sniff.\n\nThere are firm rules, then, regarding how one drinks vodka in Russia. But equally important is why one drinks vodka. In Russia, it\u2019s a supremely social activity; Russian parties take place around the table, and drinking should be a group activity, never a private pleasure. The zakuski (snacks) are there to be shared, and you must help yourself, not wait to be offered. Ward even shared an apocryphal Russian story about two American spies drinking vodka; their cover was blown by the fact that they were not chomping zakuski as they drank.\n\nThen there\u2019s the act of toasting itself. Misha was animated and emphatic about its significance. \u201cIf you drink, you need to say something!\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like [in England], where everybody sits in his corner. We are together! So there needs to be something for everybody. It helps people to feel that they\u2019re united.\u201d\n\nIt helps people to feel that they\u2019re united\n\nIn the former Soviet republic of Georgia, toasts are such elaborate affairs that professional toasters may be hired for special functions. Russian toasts, by contrast, are simple \u2013 at least, that\u2019s the idea. That day, enthusiastic toasts were made for our meeting together, for the beautiful women at the table and to the health of the Queen. Misha led the toasts and everyone followed with a hearty \u2018Poyekhali!\u2019 (\u2018Let\u2019s go!\u2019), as popularised by the cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin who exclaimed it when his spacecraft took off in 1961.\n\nClearly, Russians have a deep affection for vodka. Even the name of the drink is endearing \u2013 \u2018voda\u2019 means water, and \u2018vodka\u2019, its diminutive, translates to \u2018little water\u2019. But there is a dark side to drinking vodka in Russia, too. Historically, alcoholism has been rife in Russia, and vodka (or whatever you could get your hands on) offered an escape from the harshness of everyday life. \u201cIt could be such hell in the Soviet Union,\u201d Ward said.\n\nIndeed, before Bayliss married an Englishman and Misha and Anna moved to the UK to join her, Misha\u2019s \u2018classified\u2019 job meant that he couldn\u2019t leave the country. \u201cWe were accustomed to this way of life, but of course it wasn\u2019t normal,\u201d said Misha, of their life in Soviet-era Russia. \u201cWe regularly listened to the BBC, Voice of America, and we know there is a different life. But, you\u2019re born in this, so you know you can\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d Anna nodded in agreement. \u201cThat was like dreaming of the impossible.\u201d\n\nThe Ivanovs recounted stories of privation and party privilege without so much as a shred of drama or self-pity. \"You had access to things, or didn\u2019t have access,\" Anna said. \"You need to go and pay for something? You find a party function. You go to the shop and you can\u2019t buy any shoes, but there is a special department for party bosses and KGB bosses.\" But despite these memories, there was a great warmth to the Russian traditions we shared at the table that day, from the act of toasting to recounting old Russian stories and jokes.\n\n\u201cSomebody brought sardines to dinner,\u201d Ward said, \u201cand when the hostess opened them they were so old that they were no longer edible. And the person who brought them said, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry you misunderstood \u2013 those weren\u2019t eating sardines, those were gifting sardines!\u2019\u201d\n\nIt was time for another toast, and Misha had now taken to standing to deliver his words \u2013 these ones to absent friends. The vodka was knocked back, chunks of bread were seized and forks were plunged into salty fish. Everyone around the table was pink-cheeked and satisfied. As the afternoon melted into evening, Misha observed, stoically, \u201cVodka is like a knife. It\u2019s not good, it\u2019s not bad. You can do anything with a knife. Cut meat, cut bread \u2013 with a special knife you can make operation. But another knife can kill a person; the knife is not to be blamed.\u201d\n\nHe paused. \u201cSo, the same with vodka.

We have been to meet some of the teenagers looking to take control of their futures.\n\nEvery Friday morning, 13-year-old Holly Gillibrand, from Fort William, skips school for an hour.\n\nShe says the \"sacrifice\", as she describes it, is \"a small price to pay for standing up for our planet\".\n\n\"If you get a detention, that's nothing to how we will suffer in future if nothing is done,\" she tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.\n\n\"I want to get Scottish leaders to take climate change seriously and [know] that they're destroying my future.\"\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Thousands of students have been skipping school in Belgium to demand action\n\nHolly is part of a much wider global movement, known as Schools 4 Climate Action.\n\nIt began with 15-year-old Swede Greta Thunberg skipping class to sit outside government buildings in September, accusing her country of not following the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nSince then, tens of thousands of children across Belgium, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and Australia have been inspired to hold their own demonstrations.\n\nAnd now for the first time a coordinated protest is happening across the UK, with pupils taking to the streets in more than 30 cities and towns.\n\nFor Holly, it is just an extension of her weekly protest - which began six weeks ago.\n\nShe and a small group of supporters, including other local pupils, carry placards with slogans such as \"School strike for the climate,\" \"End the ignorance,\" and \"There is no planet B,\" outside her secondary school, at the foot of Ben Nevis.\n\nThe government says it is for individual schools to decide what to do about pupils walking out on Friday but stresses that term-time leave should be given in exceptional circumstances only.\n\nLessons are compulsory, but Holly insists skipping class is a necessary step.\n\n\"The very point about missing school is that it makes people realise it's important and we're willing to sacrifice an hour of education a week,\" she says.\n\nImage caption Holly lives in the Scottish Highlands\n\nHer mother, Kate Willis, denies any suggestion the campaign could be promoting truancy.\n\n\"What they're doing at the moment shows they are educated and aware,\" she says.\n\n\"It's going to get to the stage [with the repercussions of climate change] where education doesn't matter.\"\n\nRepeated warnings\n\nScientists have issued repeated warnings that rising global temperatures risk significant and dangerous changes to our world and that urgent, large-scale action from governments is required.\n\nA special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) last year said the target of keeping the global temperature rise under 1.5C was now completely off track, and heading instead towards 3C - but that the window of opportunity remained open.\n\nIn Lancaster, Rosie Mills successfully campaigned to get her local council to declare a \"climate emergency\", after gathering more than 1,000 signatures for her petition - all while studying for her A-levels.\n\nIt means under-18s will now be part of the decision-making process in dealing with climate change, looking at ways for the city to eventually produce no carbon at all.\n\nImage caption Rosie is worried about the impact climate change will have on her local area\n\n\"This is our future we're talking about,\" she says. \"We can all do something, because small things do add up.\"\n\nLocal environmental concerns are a priority, Rosie says, following severe flooding in the region in recent years.\n\n\"I'm worried about many things, especially in my local area, because Lancaster is a coastal area,\" she says.\n\n\"Three years ago, we had an awful storm, Storm Desmond, which absolutely devastated the area.\n\n\"There was mass flooding all around and it was repeated again two years later, in 2017.\"\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Thousands of homes in Lancashire and Cumbria were flooded by Storm Desmond in 2015\n\nRosie tries to live a sustainable lifestyle and wants to encourage others to do the same.\n\nBut for Holly, it should never have reached the point where children have to consider missing part of their education to take a stand.\n\n\"Thousands of students around the world shouldn't have to strike off school to make our voices heard,\" she says.\n\n\"Our world shouldn't have to have conservation, because our planet should be being respected and preserved.\"\n\nFollow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here."

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nDid Hillary Clinton mastermind a global child-trafficking ring from a Washington pizzeria? No.\n\nDid George W Bush orchestrate a plot to bring down the Twin Towers and kill thousands of people in 2001? Also no.\n\nSo, why do some people believe they did? And what do conspiracy theories tell us about the way we see the world?\n\nConspiracy theories are far from a new phenomenon. They have been a constant hum in the background for at least the past 100 years, says Prof Joe Uscinski, author of American Conspiracy Theories.\n\nThey are also more widespread than you might think.\n\n\"Everybody believes in at least one and probably a few,\" he says. \"And the reason is simple: there is an infinite number of conspiracy theories out there. If we were to poll on all of them, everybody is going to check a few boxes.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Comet Ping Pong Pizzeria became the subject of an online conspiracy theory about child trafficking\n\nThis finding isn't peculiar to the US. In 2015, University of Cambridge research found most Britons ticked a box when presented with a list of just five theories. These ranged from the existence of a secret group controlling world events, to contact with aliens.\n\nThis suggests that, contrary to popular belief, the typical conspiracy theorist is not a middle-aged man living in his mother's basement sporting a tinfoil hat.\n\n\"When you actually look at the demographic data, belief in conspiracies cuts across social class, it cuts across gender and it cuts across age,\" Prof Chris French, a psychologist at Goldsmith's, University of London, says.\n\nEqually, whether you're on the left or the right, you're just as likely to see plots against you.\n\n\"The two sides are equal in terms of conspiracy thinking,\" Prof Uscinski says, of research in the US.\n\n\"People who believe that Bush blew up the Twin Towers were mostly Democrats, people who thought that Obama faked his own birth certificate were mostly Republicans - but it was about even numbers within each party.\"\n\nConspiracy theories\n\nTo understand why we are so drawn to the notion of shadowy forces controlling political events, we need to think about the psychology behind conspiracy theories.\n\n\"We are very good at recognising patterns and regularities. But sometimes we overplay that - we think we see meaning and significance when it isn't really there,\" Prof French says.\n\n\"We also assume that when something happens, it happens because someone or something made it happen for a reason.\"\n\nEssentially, we see some coincidences around big events and we then make up a story out of them.\n\nThat story becomes a conspiracy theory because it contains \"goodies\" and \"baddies\" - the latter being responsible for all the things we don't like.\n\nBlaming politicians\n\nIn many ways, this is just like everyday politics.\n\nWe often blame politicians for bad events, even when those events are beyond their control, says Prof Larry Bartels, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University.\n\n\"People will blindly reward or punish the government for good or bad times without really having any clear understanding of whether or how the government's policies have contributed to those outcomes,\" he says.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Barack Obama released his birth certificate in 2011 in response to persistent rumours he had been born outside the US\n\nThis is even true when things that seem very unrelated to government go wrong.\n\n\"One instance that we looked at in some detail was a series of shark attacks off the coast of New Jersey in 1916,\" Prof Bartels says.\n\n\"This was the basis, much later, for the movie Jaws. We found that there was a pretty significant downturn in support for President [Woodrow] Wilson in the areas that had been most heavily affected by the shark attacks.\"\n\nMore stories like this\n\nThe \"us\" and \"them\" role of conspiracy theories can be found in more mainstream political groups as well.\n\nIn the UK, the EU referendum has created a group of Remainers and a similarly sized group of Leavers.\n\n\"People feel they belong to their group but it also means that people feel a certain sense of antagonism towards people in the other group,\" Prof Sara Hobolt, of the London School of Economics, says.\n\nRemainers and Leavers sometimes interpret the world differently. For example, confronted with identical economic facts, Remainers are more likely to say the economy is performing poorly and Leavers to say it is performing well.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nConspiracy theories are just another part of this.\n\n\"Leavers, who, in the run-up to the referendum, thought they were going to be on the losing side, were more likely to think that the referendum might be rigged,\" Prof Hobolt says.\n\n\"And then that really shifted after the referendum results came out, because at that point the Remainers were on the losing side.\"\n\nNo solutions\n\nIt may not be terribly cheering to learn that conspiracy theories are so embedded in political thinking. But it should not be surprising.\n\n\"It's often the case that we're constructing our beliefs in ways that support what we want to be true,\" Prof Bartels says.\n\nAnd having more information is little help.\n\n\"The people who are most subject to these biases are the people who are paying the most attention,\" he says.\n\nFor many, there is little reason to get political facts right, since your individual vote won't affect government policy.\n\n\"There is no cost for me to be wrong about my political views,\" Prof Bartels says.\n\n\"If it makes me feel good to think that Woodrow Wilson should have been able to prevent the shark attacks, then the psychological pay-off from holding those views is likely to be much greater than any penalty that I might suffer if the views are wrong.\"\n\nIn the end, we want to feel comfortable, not be right.\n\nIt is why particular conspiracy theories come and go, but also why conspiracy will always be part of the stories we tell about political events.\n\nAbout this piece\n\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.\n\nJames Tilley is professor of politics and fellow of Jesus College, University of Oxford.\n\nHis programme Conspiracy Politics was broadcast on BBC Radio 4's Analysis on 11 February and can be listened to here.\n\nEdited by Duncan Walker"

    "title": "Can captive animals ever truly return to the wild?",
    "authors": [
      "Zoe Cormier"
    ],
    "text": "For some species, the road to release is a long one.\n\nIn many ways, humans have vastly improved how we treat captive wildlife. Once Romans routinely tortured and slaughtered lions, leopards, rhinos and even elephants in the Colosseum and bear-baiting was commonplace across Europe until the 19th century.\n\nToday, with circus animals increasingly becoming a thing of the past (especially now the British government has banned them entirely), what happens too all those newly-freed animals that spent their lives in zoos and circuses or as pets? Can any animal, after years in captivity, ever be freed?\n\nEven a lifetime in the most humane zoo will have left animals too affected by years of sheltered existence. Captive animals seldom learn crucial survival skills and often are too habituated to human contact. Lacking a natural fear of humans, they are vulnerable to poachers and ill equipped for life in the wild.\n\nYoung orangutans ready to be released into the wild \u00a9 International Animal Rescue\n\nNo case makes this more heartbreakingly obvious than the story of Keiko, the orca star of Free Willy (1993). A massive letter-writing campaign demanding his freedom led to Keiko being flown to Iceland in 1999 for release. Unfortunately, Keiko was ill-equipped for survival in the wild. Captured at a very young age and too accustomed to human contact, several attempts to help him join a wild pod failed. In the end, Keiko swam into a harbor in Norway, actively seeking the company of humans. He never managed to integrate with a wild population, struggled to hunt, and eventually died of pneumonia in 2002.\n\n\u201cRelease to the wild is not automatically in the best interests of the animal,\u201d says Dr Chris Draper head of animal welfare and captivity at Born Free \u2013 a charity that campaigns to keep animals in the wild. \u201cThe damage was done when that animal was brought in from the wild in the first place; it is dangerous to assume can could be released without just adding to the misery.\u201d\n\nFor fish, reptiles, and amphibians, reintroduction can be fairly straightforward: frogs for example can often be bred in huge numbers in the lab and released to the wild. But with complex mammals such as primates, large cats, elephants, dolphins and whales, who may require years of instruction from their mothers, and an entire group of other members of their species in which they can thrive as adults, reintroduction is far more difficult.\n\n\u201cFor the longest time, the idea of returning animals such as large mammals to the wild was just off the table, but now we\u2019re seeing people in the field questioning the long-held belief that it\u2019s impossible to return captive animals to their natural habitat,\u201d says Katie Moore, deputy vice president of conservation and animal welfare for NGO the International Fund for Animal Welfare. \u201cYes, in a lot of cases it is still impossible, especially if the animals have been traumatised or were very young when captured. And you need to be very careful about introducing diseases to a wild population. But for some animals, if we proceed scientifically and thoughtfully, it can be done.\u201d\n\nConsider the African Lion and Environmental Research Trust (ALERT) in Zimbabwe, which for 15 years has worked to introduce lions to the wild. \u201cYes, lions can become habituated to humans, but we make sure the ones we released are not habituated,\u201d says Dr Norman Monks, CEO of ALERT.\n\nTheir method of release involves multiple stages, which eventually sees the release of wild offspring from previously captive adults. First, lions that have been habituated to humans are released into a large enclosure with prey species to hunt. Next, those animals (which are never handled by humans again) eventually form a pride and produce new cubs. Then those cubs, who have grown together and formed social bonds, are eventually released as a pride.\n\n\u201cThis is important, as we would not want to put these cubs into the wild if they were not a cohesive pride that would care for each other.\u201d Because lions are highly social animals (and the only social species of cat), and their innate need to live within a pride needs to be taken into account when preparing them for release to the wild.\n\nMany other groups are challenging old notions and working to develop new techniques tailored to the needs to different species to achieve what was once thought impossible, such as the Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Trust, Wildlife Vets International, and Born Free.\n\nWild release is easier for some animals than others, and the needs of individual species need to be carefully taken into account.\n\n\u201cOne species that would be incredibly problematic is polar bears. They live in a highly specialised environment, and need to learn the skills to survive in that environment from their mothers. Learning those skills in a pre-release context would be next to impossible,\u201d says Dr Draper. \u201cBut other kinds of bears seem to be reasonably successful when released back to the wild. But it depends so much on the individual animal: the age it was captured, whether it was bred in captivity, its experiences in captivity, any kinds of trauma, health, early nutrition. There is just no magic recipe.\u201d\n\nWorkers at International Animal Rescue release a slow loris into the wild after spending its life as a pet \u00a9 International Animal Rescue\n\nFor many species, just as with lions, often the key is to release animals in groups. \u201cEven chimpanzees that have lived in laboratories for many years can do pretty well when released in groups onto protected islands,\u201d says Dr Draper.\n\nSince 2006, conservationists at Orangutan Rescue in Indonesia have taken in orangutan infants who often have been kept as pets after their mothers were shot by famers for raiding crops. In the wild, an orangutan would spend up to nine years with its mother; an extraordinarily long time, even for a primate. This means orphaned orangutans require an exceptional amount of nurturing and education. Infants will spend anywhere from five to ten years at the centre being taught key survival skills such as how to climb trees, crack coconuts, fish for termites, and also that they need to fear threats such as spiders, snakes \u2013 and humans.\n\n\u201cWe try to be hands-off as much as possible. We try not to let them get attached to us, because we need them to learn not to trust people,\u201d says Karmele Llano Sanchez, program director of Orangutan Rescue at International Animal Rescue. \u201cThe key is that they learn more from each other than they do from us: one animal will learn a skill very quickly, and then go on to teach others. This is how they can re-learn how to be orangutans again. It takes many years and a lot of effort, but it has been surprisingly successful \u2013 I didn\u2019t think the release program would go as well as it is. Even wild orangutans that have been brought to us after forest fires with injuries, or who have gone through starvation, can be brought back into good health and returned to the wild.\u201d\n\nRehabilitating an orangutan doesn\u2019t come cheap: with the costs of animal care at $250 a month, it may cost $5,000 or $10,000 to eventually release an animal, and their operations are always limited by funds.\n\nThere however is an upside to the high costs that come with caring for orangutans. \u201cYes the costs are high, but the money goes mostly to paying guides and trackers that follow them in the wild once we release them \u2013 we employ a lot of people,\u201d says Sanchez. \u201cThis way we can get the buy-in of the community. It is ultimately an excellent way to provide an alternative income to hunting or logging.\u201d\n\nThis points to one of the biggest challenges with reintroduction: finding suitable habitats in a world where hunting, logging, poaching and agriculture are erasing the wild places of the world.\n\n\u201cDemand for palm oil is growing, and so the problem of orphaned orangutans is only going to get worse because Malaysians are producing palm oil for the rest of the world,\u201d says Sanchez.\n\n\u201cThe dream is to never say never, but the reality of the world we live in means that even if the animal is physically capable of doing this, finding suitable release sites is extremely challenging,\u201d says Dr Draper. \u201cBut we have to try. Yes, it is time consuming and it is expensive, but if it is possible, we have to try, simply because is the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nFor some animals, reintroduction will always be difficult, such as baby elephants, or pet cheetahs, both of which habituate to human care very quickly, says Moore of IFAW. But we\u2019ve only just started to challenge old ideas about reintroduction, and we have much to learn.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t push boundaries we will never know what is possible,\u201d she says.\n\nBy Zoe Cormier\n\nFeatured image by Getty"

The word is made up of four characters that literally translate to \u2018bad meaning\u2019 or \u2018bad feeling\u2019, and serves as a tidy catch-all that can be deployed in all kinds of situations, from meekly catching a waiter\u2019s attention to expressing a guilt-ridden apology to your boss to the paralysing feeling that washes over you as you struggle to confess your love.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 The complex art of apology in Japan\n\n\u2022 Where being nice is the law\n\n\u2022 The country that loves to give\n\nBuhaoyisi is forever on the lips of Taiwanese, according to Prof Chia-ju Chang, Chinese professor at Brooklyn College City University of New York. \u201cWe use it all the time as Taiwan is a verbally polite culture. So, we use it when we interrupt people or asking of a favour. We can even use it to start a conversation.\u201d\n\nBuhaoyisi is often spoken so fast that it comes out as a slurry of consonants that sounds like gibberish to the unsuspecting ear. And unlike \u2018Entschuldigung\u2019 in German or \u2018excuse me\u2019 in English, translating \u2018buhaoyisi\u2019 is no simple task, says Ouyu Yang, a teacher at National Taiwan University\u2019s Chinese Language Division. The Western notion of \u2018sorry\u2019 is far too limited to express all the social graces and good form that weigh down on this loaded expression; buhaoyisi can also be a feeling, a sensation, a code of conduct and a whole system of thought that permeates Taiwanese culture.\n\nThe Western notion of \u2018sorry\u2019 is far too limited to express all the social graces and good form that weigh down on this loaded expression\n\nRide the subway in Taipei and you\u2019ll hear a cacophonous chorus of \u2018buhaoyisi\u2019 as passengers gingerly nudge past others in humble deference. Enter a classroom, and you\u2019ll see students start and end each question with \u2018buhaoyisi\u2019, dripping with a sense of indebtedness and gratefulness even as the discussion continues. Open an email, and the first line will usually be \u2018Buhaoyisi\u2019 \u2013 implying \u2018sorry to slightly bother you\u2019 \u2013 even for the smallest of favours. And if a dear cousin gives you a gift, the correct response isn\u2019t \u2018thank you\u2019, but rather, \u2018buhaoyisi\u2019 for the inconvenience I\u2019ve caused you.\n\nFor the uninitiated outsider, Taiwan may seem like the world\u2019s most apologetic country, a nation obsessed with saying sorry \u2013 but in fact, the culture of buhaoyisi reveals a lot about the islands\u2019 hidden layers of modesty and shyness.\n\nDecades of Japanese colonisation, as well as moral teachings of Confucianism, have played a huge hand in shaping Taiwan\u2019s extreme apology culture to what you see and hear today, according to Khin-huann Li, sociolinguistics professor emeritus at National Taiwan Normal University. Although the phrase\u2019s exact origins are unknown, Li and other linguists theorise that it is largely a product of the millennia-old Confucian notion of harmony, which centres on maintaining interpersonal relationships rather than individual ones. Preserving social cohesion at all costs is still the bedrock of Taiwan\u2019s social morality; placing the larger clan, the society, before yourself, the individual, is key.\n\nIn addition, part of Taiwan's buhaoyisi culture is heavily influenced from Japan\u2019s sumimasen apology culture, with the two sharing a deep history.\n\nOverall, as a habit, saying buhaoyisi often helps confrontations from escalating further, Li said.\n\n\u201cTraditional Taiwanese culture is like that \u2013 more delicate and thinking of other people, trying to keep polite relationships with others,\u201d he explained.\n\nOn the one hand, the expression carries an air of submissiveness and hyper decorum, but on the other hand, it also demonstrates the unparalleled politeness of Taiwan. That's why, for the traveller, saying sorry in Chinese can easily turn into a linguistic minefield. When in doubt, Li says, err on the safe side and just say buhaoyisi; chances are they\u2019ll say buhaoyisi back to you. It\u2019s the unspoken rule on the islands of Taiwan.\n\nLi also suggests that this culture of buhaoyisi is unique to Taiwan, as opposed to the rest of the Chinese-speaking world; while you'll hear buhaoysi many times over throughout the streets of Taiwan, you are less likely to hear buhaoyisi being used in this way in China or Malaysia, which place less emphasis on such polite-isms.\n\nWhen in doubt, err on the safe side and just say buhaoyisi\n\nAccording to InterNations\u2019 Expat Insider Index, Taiwan is consistently ranked as one of the world\u2019s friendliest countries. Around 90% of expats in Taiwan gave residents high marks for hospitality, compared to a combined average of 65% in the rest of the surveyed countries. Nowadays, more than one-third of expats are considering staying on the tiny Pacific island forever, according to the survey of 12,500-plus respondents around the world. The secret to attracting people to the lush, tropical islands of Taiwan is really no secret at all \u2013 just be, well, nice.\n\nHowever, according to 25-year-old pharmacist Jieru You, who lives in the port city of Kaohsiung, this nice, little narrative that Taiwan is leading the world in friendliness may be a false one, or at least not the full picture. Having to make yourself smaller and apologise constantly for small inconveniences, and sometimes even your mere presence, can ultimately do more harm than help. And ironically, asking permission to do, to speak, to come and to go all the time can be unnecessarily inconveniencing yourself more than anyone else.\n\n\u201cWhen making a request to someone else, Taiwanese people will often use buhaoyisi as a lead-in to express their desire to ask for help from a place of humble submission,\u201d You said. As a matter of fact, he was already feeling a bit \u2018buhaoyisi\u2019 \u2013 embarrassed to be interviewed at all \u2013 before diving into his thoughts.\n\nThe concept of \u2018saving face\u2019 is a big deal in Taiwan. Imagine a chessboard of social exchanges, in which everyone else\u2019s moves affects your next one. Face, in this case, is the social currency that allows you to make friends and foster professional connections that can lead you to your next big job, an investment in your company or even a warm introduction to your future wife. Without \u2018face\u2019, people are less likely to trust you or help you get ahead in life. The end game is to protect yourself, your self-image and your dignity and curry favour with others by reciprocating their acts of kindness.\n\nThat\u2019s why Taiwan is confrontation-averse; it\u2019s a country constantly striving to avoid conflicts and preserve harmony at all costs. But what happens when fiercely following that moral compass goes awry? You just might get something akin to Taiwan\u2019s conundrum of over-apologising.\n\nThe end game is to protect yourself, your self-image and your dignity\n\nOn the flipside, people with \u2018thin face\u2019, meaning a lack or loss of your social reputation and status, try not to trouble others for fear of inconveniencing them, and they certainly don't like to lose face in public, adds Yang. So instead of standing up, everyone sits down and stays there while little gets done.\n\nYang feels like she\u2019s drowning in a pool of too many perfunctory apologies, in which saying buhaoyisi is more of a habit than a word with deeper meaning. The result is half-hearted, stripped of any sincere apology or regret. Not to mention, thanks to the island\u2019s growing global isolation and economic malaise, Taiwanese are suffering from the poetically named syndrome of guidao, or \u2018ghost island\u2019.\n\nOn the world stage, Taiwan\u2019s identity is often misunderstood, says Wenhui Chen, informatics professor at Ming Chuan University, who studies the ghost-island phenomenon. He says that the island is often viewed as a pawn between China and the US, floating along without many of the diplomatic trappings of an officially recognised country. Chen predicts Taiwan\u2019s apologetic, kow-towing culture may not prove so fruitful in the end, and could even lead to the society\u2019s own undoing.\n\nOf course, not everyone bears such a doom-and-gloom forecast for Taiwan. Li, for his part, sees the island\u2019s deep buhaoyisi culture as integral to keeping the peace \u2013 and if the culture of buhaoyisi disappears, then so will centuries of timeworn tradition.\n\n\u201cIf the society keeps these concepts and expresses these words daily, then the society could be more polite, more moral and more conservative,\u201d Li said. \u201cIf not, the society becomes impolite, immoral and too aggressive. Taiwan\u2019s culture [must] be kept in a good shape in terms of morality and harmony.\u201d He then ended with the obligatory \u2018buhaoyisi\u2019.\n\nWhy We Are What We Are is a BBC Travel series examining the characteristics of a country and investigating whether they are true.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nAround the world, people use chocolate treats to express sweet nothings on Valentine's Day.\n\nBut in Japan, it's a little more complicated. On Valentine's Day, only women give chocolate, and not just to their partners, but to their male colleagues too.\n\nCritics say the practice sucks all the fun out of Valentine's Day and instead turns it into a dreary duty where women risk offending co-workers if they leave someone out.\n\nOthers say \"giri choco\", which translates to \"obligation chocolate\" is a little misunderstood, and besides, it's slowly fading as women opt to give chocolate to their friends instead.\n\n'Obligation chocolate'\n\nOf course, giving chocolate on Valentine's Day can also be a romantic gesture. Women will often give \"honmei choco\" or \"true feelings chocolate\" to their partners.\n\nBut giri choco is more about expressing appreciation to male colleagues.\n\nA 2017 survey by multinational firm 3M found that nearly 40% of female respondents planned to give giri choco to a co-worker.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nFor most, it was a simple thank you \"for general help and support\". Others felt it helped promote a smoother workplace, while a small minority felt it would be awkward not to take part.\n\nNot so sweet\n\nChocolate journalist Ayumi Ichikawa says many women have no problem with giri choco. After all, Japan has a gift-giving culture, so it doesn't seem out of place.\n\n\"It's part of our tradition to give presents to people who 'help us'... and we have a habit of giving friends and acquaintances gifts every now and then to show our gratitude for 'looking after us'... without any sense of romantic love.\"\n\nBut others are troubled by the custom.\n\n\"Some consider the ritual burdensome, feeling you must do this, so the chocolate becomes a duty,\" Ms Ichikawa says.\n\nStill, University of Shizuoka professor Sejiro Takeshita says the tradition isn't as \"unfair as it looks\".\n\nOn 14 March Japan celebrates White Day, when men give chocolates to women and, Prof Takeshita says, \"ladies can get their vengeance\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nPower dynamics\n\nIn a 1996 study of \"office women\" sociologist Ogasawa Yuko argued giri choco is a way for women to exercise power over men by ranking them.\n\nThe ones they admire would get chocolate, while the incompetent ones could buy their own treats.\n\n\"In other words, it could be seen as one of the few opportunities for women to exercise power over men, resisting prevailing gendered norms,\" says Sachiko Horiguchi, an anthropologist at Temple University Japan.\n\nMore than two decades later, this might seem a little less appealing to Japanese working women.\n\n\"I am not sure if these professional women feel obliged to 'exercise their power' through giri choco gift giving,\" says Ms Horiguchi.\n\nChocolate battle\n\nLast year the practice attracted an unexpected critic in the form of Belgian chocolatier Godiva. The company took out a full page ad calling for an end to giri choco.\n\n\"Valentine's Day is supposed to be a day when you tell someone your pure feelings. It's not a day on which you're supposed to do something extra for the sake of smooth relations at work,\" the ad said.\n\nThey followed up this year with a tweet to Yuraku Confectionery, the makers of Black Thunder, a low-cost chocolate and self-styled \"king of giri choco\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe tweet encouraged employees of Yuraku to buy Godiva to give to someone they loved, prompting Yuraku to add \"officially recognized by Godiva as obligation chocolate\" to its Twitter description.\n\nChocolate makers have an obvious stake in the discussion and it was commercial interests - initially department stores - that brought Valentine's Day to Japan in the first place.\n\nCritics have also suggested that Godiva stands to lose little from this position, because it's a luxury brand which few people give as giri choco.\n\nJapan's sweet tooth\n\nValentine's Day is hugely important for Japan's confectionery industry, with some shops doing 70% of their annual business in the lead-up to the holiday, says chocolate journalist Ms Ichikawa.\n\nBut over the coming years, maybe less of it will be giri choco.\n\nMs Horiguchi says Valentine's Day is becoming less gendered, and the pressure to give giri choco is declining as women opt to give chocolates to their friends instead."

The only known population of the new genus is found in a wayside area disturbed with vehicular movement, plantation activities and human settlements,\" says Ms Garg.\n\n\"Since little is known about the habitat requirements and the distribution range of the new frog, the specific site needs to be preserved to protect this frog.\"\n\nA new tadpole that burrows through sand was discovered in Western Ghats in 2016, and an extraordinary tree frog thought to have died out more than a century ago was also rediscovered in the same year.\n\nIn 2017, four new species of burrowing frogs were discovered in the region."

    ],
    "text": "In Blantyre, Malawi, a group of farmers are assembled around a pile of material that could help shape Africa\u2019s future. It doesn\u2019t look like much: a two by two metre pile of alternating layers of moist organic matter like corn stalks and chicken manure.\n\nBut over eight weeks of microbial activity and periodic turning, the unwieldy, slightly smelly mass will transform itself into compost \u2013 a low cost way to improve soils and reduce dependency on mineral fertilisers, which are at best expensive and at worst often not available at all.\n\n\"This is not your ordinary backyard compost pile, where you throw your kitchen scraps,\" says Johann van der Ham, who runs the demonstration farm, as he watches his students watering the next load of manure in a wheel barrow.\n\n\"It's a thermic compost pile. We teach how to build it systematically and to scale it to the needs of every farm.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 The women saving Africa\u2019s wildlife\n\n\u2022 How to use seawater to grow food \u2013 in the desert\n\n\u2022 Zimbabwe\u2019s cure for depression?\n\nThe farmers learning how to make this compost, and the other people in their communities that they will bring this information back to, are smallholder subsistence farmers.\n\nExplore the compost workshop with our 360 video below:\n\n\u201cFor them, one failed harvest means hunger and misery \u2013 or worse,\u201d says van der Ham. \u201cSo for them, improving soils is not an add-on, not just something to raise the bottom line.\n\n\u201cIt's a matter of survival.\u201d\n\nFertiliser\u2019s future\n\nMost African soils are inherently poor. Over millions of years, younger, more fertile layers have weathered away, leaving large parts of the ancient shield exposed. In sub-Saharan Africa, widespread maize monoculture has depleted soils further.\n\nTo grow properly, plants need water, light and air. They also need nutrients from the soil, including nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus. All of these are important \u2013 but phosphorus especially, because it affects the plant early in its life. The plant needs it to build its root system, which is the basis for taking up other nutrients. Without enough phosphorus, plants are stunted and yield little.\n\nPutting phosphorus back into the soil in Africa, therefore, is particularly important for farmers \u2013 and, by extension, for much of the population: eight out of 10 Malawian workers are employed in farming.\n\nWatch local women shuck maize in our 360 video below:\n\nThese days, most phosphorus in agriculture worldwide comes from mineral fertilisers. But the future of these mineral fertilisers has become uncertain.\n\nThe first phosphorus price shock came in 2008, when the commodity price of rock phosphate, the raw material that is mined, spiked 800%.\n\n\"That's when people started to pay attention,\" says Dana Cordell, a research director at the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology Sydney and co-founder of the Global Phosphorus Research Initiative. She is studying how Malawi can adapt to the emerging phosphorus challenges. \"Before 2008, phosphorus was pretty much taken for granted.\u201d\n\nSince then, there have been several assessments of global rock phosphate reserves, with widely differing results. Estimates for when \u201cpeak phosphorus\u201d will occur \u2013 the moment just before extraction will begin to decline, thanks to depleted high-quality reserves and higher costs of mining the remaining deposits \u2013 range from 30 to 300 years. (The numbers vary because of different judgments about quality of deposits and progress in extraction technologies, and because many producers keep a close lid on their data for fear of tipping off the competition.)\n\nBut even if there may be enough phosphorus to last centuries, there are other problems with relying on it \u2013 like the very uneven distribution of its deposits. \"Phosphate resources are more geopolitically concentrated than oil,\" Cordell says. \"While all countries and farmers need access to phosphorus, only five countries combined control 88% of remaining phosphate reserves.\" Morocco alone has 75% of estimated global reserves, some of it in the disputed territory of Western Sahara.\n\nFor importing countries, this supply concentration creates both a short-term business risk and a long-term national security risk, Cordell warns.\n\nThe situation is especially problematic for a small landlocked nation like Malawi, which is entirely dependent on imports \u2013 making it vulnerable to global price spikes and a difficult world market.\n\nMaking matters more difficult, for fertiliser to be helpful, it needs to be bought early in the season \u2013 but they won\u2019t know at that point if other factors, like weather and pests, will work out. They may spend their little savings on fertiliser only for pests to ruin the crop late in the season. As a result, for many farmers, each bag of fertiliser is a gamble. Each time, they have to ask themselves whether buying phosphorus is worth the risk.\n\nSee farmers shopping at a fertiliser store in our 360 video below:\n\nTo help farmers access fertiliser, the Malawian government launched a comprehensive subsidy programme in 2005. Coinciding with favourable weather, it brought some improvement in its first years. But over time, yields have stagnated.\n\nThe solution to Malawi's phosphorus problems, it turns out, requires more than just pouring mineral fertiliser onto the land.\n\nCompost chemistry\n\nThe problem is chemistry. The soils in Malawi and in much of sub-Saharan Africa are acidic. This means most phosphate ions quickly bind with iron or aluminium oxides and are no longer available for plants.\n\nThis means that, even when there is a lot of phosphorus around, much of it is practically useless for agriculture. As a result, before mineral fertilisers can be fully effective, the structure of the soils needs to change.\n\nA mineral fertiliser can\u2019t do that. But compost can.\n\nThat is because compost can do something that mineral fertiliser cannot. It doesn't just provide phosphorus and other vital nutrients \u2013 it can also restore the soil structure by adding organic matter.\n\nHealthy, productive soil is not just dirt with some nutrients; it is a living ecosystem, explains van der Ham. And keeping this ecosystem alive means keeping enough organic matter in the soil to keep microbes, mites, fungi, worms and assorted other critters who live there happy, well fed and able to do their jobs. One of their jobs? Solubilising \u2013 which means freeing phosphorus and other nutrients from their bonds and making them available for plants.\n\nBack at the workshop, van der Ham is trying to drive the point home. \"How many people live in Malawi?\" he asks. The answer is about 19 million.\n\n\"You see,\" he says with a smile, \"there are more organisms in a teaspoon of healthy soil than there are people in all of Malawi.\"\n\nVan der Ham practises what he preaches. On his own fields, he hasn't used mineral-based fertiliser for over six years. Instead, his crops get all their phosphorus and other nutrients from compost, manure, and mulching.\n\nEase of access\n\nThere is also yet another benefit of compost compared to mineral fertilisers: it is more accessible.\n\nBilly Bray leads the Malawi branch of a Dutch NGO called Waste, which focuses on sanitation. \"We need to generate value from waste,\" he says, \"so we create new sources of income, and discourage illegal dumping and other practices. And compost is a very valuable product here.\" His group works closely with Blantyre\u2019s city government and is currently building a pilot facility at one of Blantyre's water treatment plants. \"Our idea is to reduce the risk for local entrepreneurs. If we can prove that compost can be profitable, that there is a market, others will follow,\" he says.\n\nBut raising awareness about the issue isn\u2019t always easy.\n\n\"Nutrient recovery is not on people's mind at the moment,\" says Emmanuel Kanjunjunju, Blantyre\u2019s director of health and social services. \"They have so many other problems. But as the city, we have to think ahead. You can't work in a crisis. You will always be failing. These systems have to be planned 10, sometimes 30 years ahead\u2026\n\n\"It's difficult in the sense that you have a current situation, where you just want to address the problems of today. But people forget: for these problems to reach the way they are today, it may be because we did not plan.\u201d\n\nAt the moment, the team from Waste is building drying beds for fecal sludge. In the end, the dried sludge will make up about 5% of the finished compost. The rest comes from market waste, like spoilt fruit and vegetables, as well as chicken manure from a nearby poultry farm.\n\nThe NGO\u2019s goal is to produce about 1,000 tonnes of compost per year for the wholesale market. \"The smallholders won't buy from us,\" says Bray. \"But they will follow the example of the big farmers once they see the results.\"\n\n\"Technological fixes alone won't solve the phosphorus problem,\" says Johan Six, professor for sustainable agroecosystems at ETH Z\u00fcrich. \"We need a much more integrated approach to the way we do farming.\"\n\nExplore a local market in our 360 video below:\n\nHe and his colleagues are analysing how farming methods like agroforestry, intercropping and conservation agriculture affect the composition of soils. \"We have known for a long time that these methods can be beneficial for the nutrient balance in soils,\" Six says.\n\nBut until recently, the focus has been mostly on nitrogen and carbon. \"Phosphorus availability is much more difficult to measure and has been somewhat neglected,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is beginning to change, but there is still a lot we don't know about how phosphorus is actually behaving in the soil.\" This information will be vital if these new methods are to be deployed at a larger scale.\n\nIn Malawi, Six and his colleague Janina Dierks study the effects of faidherbia trees, a local type of acacia, on maize. The farmers like these trees because the plants shed their leaves during the rainy season, so they compete less for sunlight with the crops. Faidherbia trees have rich communities of symbiotic mycorrhiza, fungi that live in the root system. Greenhouse experiments show that the tiny organisms facilitate the uptake of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus not just for their hosts, but for other plants, too.\n\nSix and Dierks want to find out if this is true in the field as well \u2013 and if so, to what extent.\n\nUltimately, to manage phosphorus sustainably, one has to consider the entire system: from microorganisms to trees, local farmers to fertiliser manufacturers, regional governments to global traders.\n\n\"And to be able to do this, you have to know what goes where,\" says Frank Mnthambala, a PhD student at the Malawi Polytechnic at the University of Malawi, who works with Dana Cordell and other scientists.\n\nMnthambala is currently tracking the flow of phosphorus through the Malawian system. He notes that there are many unused sources of phosphorus in the system \u2013 like fecal sludge, runoff from fisheries or different kinds of compost. \"But nobody has ever quantified them before,\" says Mnthambala, and without being quantified, it\u2019s hard to prioritise which ones should be tapped into.\n\nOnce Mnthambala has found the most promising sources for phosphorus recovery, figuring out how to access them will be his next step.\n\n\"Our goal is to make Malawi more independent from imports,\u201d Mnthambala says. \u201cAnd managing our nutrients will help us to achieve this goal.\"\n\nThis story was reported with support from the European Journalism Centre (EJC), funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

Eleven was the most auspicious time to meet in the city, she\u2019d emailed a few days prior, but it was equally important for us not to be late for midday. We had to hurry.\n\nCrossing a footbridge over the Aare River, she cut left on Klosterplatz, pressing on past a grand 18th-Century warehouse \u2013 rushing, rushing \u2013 to a place that would reveal much about the history and extraordinary obsession of this little-known town in the shadow of Switzerland\u2019s Jura Mountains. For hidden in plain sight, on the west wall of an investment bank, is a wall-mounted clock. And it is a key to a curiosity unknown even to most Swiss.\n\nThe clock, with its 11-hour dial and number 12 missing, is a confusing anomaly to any unsuspecting passer-by. But make no mistake; it is no accident. When its 11 cogs turn to chime its 11 bells \u2013 courtesy of a harlequin dutifully striking a hammer at the random times of 11:00, 12:00, 17:00 and 18:00 \u2013 the metalwork sculpture performs the Solothurner Lied, the city\u2019s unofficial anthem. The clock doesn\u2019t just tell the time, albeit in a puzzling way. It helps reveal the town\u2019s fascination with the number 11.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 Why China is obsessed with numbers\n\n\u2022 Why Icelanders believe in elves\n\n\u2022 Switzerland\u2019s new \u2018criminal\u2019 currency\n\nSolothurn, founded by the Romans 2,000 years ago but forgotten by many visitors today due to its proximity to nearby capital Bern, is a town preoccupied with 11. It is neither a gimmick nor the result of coincidence, and the town is home to 11 churches, 11 chapels, 11 fountains, 11 towers and 11 museums \u2013 an astonishing architectural ensemble.\n\nThis collective ranges from the 15th Century to today. Some are time-worn and antiquated, some \u2013 in the case of ENTER, Switzerland\u2019s only museum devoted to computers and technology \u2013 are resolutely modern. More often than not, bemused visitors do little more than gaze at the oldest building in the city, the astronomical clock, all set about with golden stars, orbs and moving figures of a king, knight and skeleton. But I wanted to delve deeper.\n\nFor her part, St\u00e4hlin doesn\u2019t claim to be any kind of expert numerologist, only an enthusiast. Her authority on the subject comes from growing up in the town and being happy to share her knowledge as a historian. \u201cThis story will never die,\u201d she told me as we watched the 11-hour clock finish its chimes. \u201cBut now, we must get going \u2013 you still have to see our numerical masterpiece.\u201d\n\nHeading down Judengasse, or Jew\u2019s Street, past a striking building once home to the Blacksmith\u2019s Guild \u2013 one of the town\u2019s 11 medieval societies \u2013 it was not long before we reached what St\u00e4hlin was talking about: the magnificent Cathedral of St Ursus, resplendent in the midday sunshine.\n\nHere, the number 11 is alive in the magnificent heritage site at an almost inconceivable level. It was built, somewhat predictably, in 11 years, and conceived by Italian architect Gaetano Matteo Pisoni, who impregnated the building with a multitude of symbols and signs. The cathedral hints at some cryptic element in the process of its creation, but also at numerical sequences that ultimately add up to something far more powerful.\n\nEleven represents the dream of trying to attain something better\n\nStanding in front of its Romanesque fa\u00e7ade, what strikes the onlooker is the calculated brilliance behind the cathedral\u2019s frame. There are 11 rows of steps, followed by another 11, then a third set. There are two classical fountains flanking the staircase \u2013 one of Gideon and one of a devil-horned Moses \u2013 each adorned with 11 fine taps that trickle water into basins below in the heat of summer. There are 11 doors, while the structure\u2019s height is split into three parts \u2013 of 11m each \u2013 and it is all dominated by the 66m-high belfry. That this tower hides a carillon of bells just shy of a dozen should come as no surprise.\n\n\u201cPisoni ran riot with the idea,\u201d said St\u00e4hlin, as if still bewildered by the concept after all these years. \u201cHe was ordered by the government at the time to include the number 11. And he did. Everywhere. Even one of the altars is made from 11 types of marble.\u201d\n\nAnywhere else, the town cathedral would hum with the chit-chat of visitors. Not here. It is as if Solothurn has fallen out of history and been forgotten. Inside, it was just me, my guide and the echoes of our footfalls crossing the nave as we walked to the 11th flag stone, laid at the heart of the building and the only place from where you can see the cathedral\u2019s 11 altars. I noticed the pews were also arranged in rows of 11.\n\nEveryone in Solothurn knows this story, of course, but no-one can remember exactly how or why their hometown became so obsessed. A folk legend speaks of magical elves coming from nearby Weissenstein mountain to hearten the town\u2019s inhabitants who worked hard, but never prospered. The adoption of the number 11, or \u2018elf\u2019 in German, was the townsfolk\u2019s tribute to their saviours. Or so the tall tale goes.\n\nA far more reasonable explanation is the number\u2019s biblical connotations, with many Solothurn inhabitants deeming 11 to be a \u2018holy\u2019 number and prophetic. In numerology, 11 is considered the most intuitive of all numbers, commonly associated with faith and psychics, but the beliefs held by the faithful at the Cathedral of St Ursus are equally compelling.\n\n\u201cThere were 12 apostles, but 11 represents the dream of trying to attain something better,\u201d St\u00e4hlin said, closing the door behind us and heading back into the daylight. \u201cFor us, it symbolises our never-ending pursuit of perfection \u2013 it is a cipher for hope.\u201d\n\nIf religion is one strand of Solothurn\u2019s numerological DNA, geopolitics is another. Throughout history, further echoes of the number can be traced back to the Late Middle Ages, without having to look too hard to find a pattern. In 1481, Solothurn became the 11th canton of the Swiss Confederation, and by the 16th-Century, the canton had been divided into 11 protectorates. What\u2019s more, the first time the number is mentioned, back in 1252, the guilds that first voted for the town\u2019s council elected 11 members.\n\nIt is impossible to fully understand the mindset of medieval Solothurn, but the number comes naturally to the town now. It is especially fascinating to learn that children enjoy a special celebration on their 11th birthday. Likewise, Confiserie Hofer, a bakery now in its 100th year, has the aptly named 11-i chocolate bar, while the abstract concept has become an opportunity swiftly seized on by the town\u2019s flagship brewery.\n\n\u201cMy father is from Bern and he had never heard of the \u201811 story\u2019,\u201d said brewmaster Moritz K\u00fcnzle, while showing me the family brewery \u2013 \u00d6ufi-Bier, or \u2018Eleven Beer\u2019 in the local dialect \u2013 a short walk from Solothurn\u2019s centre. \u201cBut we liked the idea of a number as a brand. It\u2019s unusual and memorable. We were the first to do it, but there is now an \u201811\u2019 this and an \u201811\u2019 that. It\u2019s growing every year.\u201d An 11-year-old whisky matured in beer barrels is in the works, too.\n\nFor more than 500 years, Solothurn has developed an extraordinary alliance with the number 11. It is all too much to be an accident, and in the years to come, it may continue in the same way. And to think: one week ago, it would just have been another number.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

    "text": "Why we need to change how we talk about how animals grieve\n\nWhenever animals are seen grieving the dead, we sit up and take notice. In August 2018, an orca calf died off the coast of Vancouver Island, and its mother, Tahelqua, kept its corpse with her for 17 days straight. The images made news around the world. Two years ago, at the Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphange Trust in Zambia, a female chimp named Noel attempted to clean the teeth of her dead adopted son Thomas, dubbed a \u201cmortuary ritual\u201d by many. Elephants are famed for visiting the remains of dead family members, stroking their bones or at times rocking back and forth in what resembles a \u201cvigil\u201d.\n\nCan you die from a broken heart?\n\nMost dramatic, in 1972 Jane Goodall witnessed a young male chimp named Flint die just a month after the death of his mother Flo \u2013 the male was so despondent following her death that he stopped eating or socializing to the point that he simply didn\u2019t survive.\n\nWhether or not it is possible to \u201cdie of a broken\u201d heart, one thing is without question:\n\n\u201cWe humans don\u2019t own love or grief \u2013 these emotions are widespread in other animals,\u201d says Dr Barbara J King, Emerita Professor of Anthropology at the College of William and Mary, and author of How Animals Grieve.\n\nScientists and philosophers have been extremely hesitant to describe the behaviour of any animal towards one of their dead as \u201cgrieving\u201d, for fear of anthropomorphizing \u00a9 Franz Aberham/Getty\n\nDarwin himself thought other animals capable of emotions such as happiness and misery, and stories of elephants mourning the dead were recorded by Pliny the Elder (23-79 AD). Yet for much of the past two centuries scientists and philosophers were extremely hesitant to describe the behaviour of any animal towards one of their dead as \u201cgrieving\u201d, for fear of anthropomorphizing \u2013 to attribute human traits, emotions, or intentions to animals.\n\nOver the course of her research, Dr King began to feel \u201cthat we were straight-jacketed intellectually by our fears of anthropomorphism\u201d, so she created a set of criteria:\n\n\u201cIf a surviving animal who had a close relationship to the newly deceased becomes socially withdrawn, failing to eat and sleep and travel in routine ways, and shows species-specific evidence of emotion \u2013 then we can see widespread evidence of an emotional response to death in animals.\u201d\n\nThe increase in scientific evidence for grief and mourning in other species has grown so much over the past decade, the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal B devoted an entire issue to responses to death in both animals and humans, with the proposal to define an entire new field of study: \u201cevolutionary thanatology\u201d.\n\nThe ultimate goal: not simply cataloguing the range of behaviours across the animal kingdom and human cultures, but \u201cdeveloping a more explicit evolutionary consideration of all aspect of studies of death and dying\u201d.\n\nAfter all, if it is said \u201cnothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution\u201d then the question begs to be asked: Why should grief exist at all?\n\nWhen mourning, both animals and humans behave in a variety of ways that are simply not useful to survival: withdrawing into solitude, retreating from socialising, sleeping less, eating less, foraging less, mating less, and if spending time tending to a corpse, exposing oneself to pathogens and making oneself vulnerable to predators. Taken to the next level in human cultures, with the amount of land we devote to cemeteries, the time and money we devote to funerals, and the profound pain we experience with loss, grief is even more draining \u2013 and puzzling.\n\nWhat can be gained from grieving?\n\nCertain experiences in life may be painful, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily make them maladaptive. When we experience physical pain from a cut or a burn, that pain is an evolved response signaling to us to remove ourselves from the source of pain. Pain is useful. People born with a congenital insensitivity to pain tend to die young, accruing incessant injuries and infections. Pain is useful. But what can be gained from grieving \u2013 from retreating from the world, neglecting sleeping and eating?\n\nIn this light, understanding when, why, and how animals respond to the dead doesn\u2019t just teach us about animal sentience, or our own evolution \u2013 it helps us understand the phenomenon of grief itself.\n\nBecause mourning is not limited to big-brained cetaceans (whales and dolphins) or primates \u2013 scientists have documented some form of \u201cdeath response\u201d in seals, manatees, dingoes, horses, dogs, housecats, and more. Striking examples include 27 adult giraffes holding a vigil for one dead baby giraffe, elephants from five different families visiting the bones of one of the dead, a group of 15 dolphins slowing their speed to escort a mother dolphin carrying her dead calf, and a strange case of two ducks rescued from a foie gras farm who formed a friendship at their sanctuary home. When one duck died, the other lay with its head on the others neck for hours.\n\nThough charismatic mammals make headlines, responses to death can also be seen in non-mammals \u2013 such as birds, like the foie gras ducks, and wild scrub jays observed in the field.\n\nCrows are thought to exhibit a \u201cdanger response\u201d to dead crows \u00a9 Tim Grist Photography/Getty\n\n\u201cWe wanted to move beyond anecdotes, and do an experimental study to try and drive at the adaptive value of showing an interest in dead conspecifics,\u201d says Dr Kaeli Swift, who tested how crows would respond to dead crows, pigeons and squirrels left in their environment, publishing her results in that same issue of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B. Crows were more likely to alarm call and recruit other birds in response to dead crows than pigeons or squirrels or stuffed crows mounted in a life-like pose \u2013 consistent with the idea that crows exhibit a \u201cdanger response\u201d to dead crows.\n\nDo humans and animals grieve in the same way?\n\n\u201cThere is value in paying attention to your dead to teach you about ways you might die yourself \u2013 so you avoid these things,\u201d explains Dr Swift. \u201cThere is value in understanding how this behaviour originated in order to understand our own evolution, how this behaviour went from its original state to the enormous suite it manifests in our own species.\u201d\n\nFrom this viewpoint, understanding the reasons for mourning in animals will help us understand mourning in ourselves. Our responses to death share much in common with animals. For one, like humans, animals will vary in the degree they respond to death \u2013 both individually and as species. In general, the more social the species, the more likely they will behave in a manner that could be described as grieving. And the closer two individuals, the more likely one will grieve.\n\nDolphins and whales for example are both highly intelligent and highly social, so it should come as no surprise that they will attend to a dead member of the pod \u2013 most frequently, a mother to a dead calf. This can involve not just dragging or carrying a dead corpse, as in the case of Tahelqua the orca, but also more spontaneous and active behaviours, such as lifting and sinking a corpse up to the surface (as if to help it breathe), and hauling, spinning, and diving with it.\n\nDr Joan Gonzalvo of the Ionian Project, funded by the Tethys Research Institute, has seen bottlenose dolphins attending to a dead calf on three occasions \u2013 twice, with a mother carrying her calf for several days, and once an entire pod struggling to keep a dying baby afloat, then remaining in the area for a time after it died and sank.\n\n\u201cGrieving is a question of coming to terms with the idea of loss,\u201d he says. \u201cSo my hypothesis is that when the mothers carried their calves for several days, it was because the calves were newborn, so the death was unexpected and sudden. The mothers needed more time to grieve. But when the pod had to care for an animal that had been struggling for some time already, in some ways it was a relief when it died, so they could move away that day rather than carrying the body for a week.\u201d\n\nAs strange as it might seem, carrying the dead body of an infant is extremely common among primates. Many primate species have been observed to carry dead infants for weeks or even months \u2013 in extreme instances, mothers have carried their babies until they were completely mummified by the heat, or even just a skeleton or spine remained.\n\nBut this is just one of the few ways primates might respond to death: they may exhibit physical interactions with a corpse such as grooming, teeth cleaning and gentle touching, or even rougher behaviours such as hair-pulling, attempted mounting and even cannibalism.\n\nAs strange as it might seem, carrying the dead body of an infant is extremely common among primates. Many primate species have been observed to carry dead infants for weeks or even months \u00a9 Marco Bottigelli\n\n\u201cDeath is one of the most severe social events that can happen in a social species.\"\n\n\u201cI have witnessed immensely gentle and careful caretaking, but male chimps can be aggressive in other instances \u2013 they are still themselves,\u201d says Dr King, who has observed chimps, bonobos, gorillas and other primates for many years. \u201cLike with people, it\u2019s a mix depending on the personality, and it tends to break down along friendship lines.\u201d\n\nIt is the social dimensions in chimps that interest Dr Edwin van Leeuwen of the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. When he documented Noel cleaning the teeth of her adopted son Thomas \u2013 a highly unusual behaviour not seen before \u2013 he felt the motivations could be explains through social dynamics.\n\n\u201cI think she was expressing her social bond by doing something with his body,\u201d he says. \u201cDeath is one of the most severe social events that can happen in a social species. When a more mature individual dies for example, there needs to be some reforming of social bonds. Or there may be a response by an entire group to a mother that has lost her infant, as a form of social cohesion. In mammalian species \u2013 like ourselves \u2013 where sociality is of high importance for survival, you see a strong emotional capacity for responding to death.\u201d\n\nFor Dr Dora Biro of the University of Oxford, who has observed chimps responding to the dead twice, the implications run even deeper than that.\n\n\u201cFrom a developmental point of view, children take quite a long time to acquire a fully complete concept of death. It\u2019s not something that comes naturally to us \u2013 it is something we acquire through experiences,\u201d she says.\n\nThere are essentially four components to death that psychologists have identified: Irreversibility, non-functionality (the dead do not respond to anything), causality (the biological basis of death), and universality: all living things will die, including yourself.\n\n\u201cWhen, and in what order did we acquire these components?\u201d she asks. \u201cTo understand the extent to which non-humans possess any of these components can tell us a great deal about the evolutionary origins of our own cognition.\u201d\n\nIf grief is something we see in highly social animals, and most often seen in individuals with close social bonds, this ultimately tells us a great deal about how mourning is an evolved response to \u201ccoming to terms with the idea of loss\u201d as Dr Gonzalvo puts it. Intelligent animals and humans need time to process it. Or, in layman\u2019s terms: grief is the price we pay for love. Little wonder archaeological sites show signs we painted the dead with ochre over 100,000 years ago, and cultures worldwide have developed an astounding array of complex rituals, from funerary rites to cemeteries, decorated coffins to pyramids and even the strange rite of the Torajans who will live with the mummified corpse of a family member for weeks.\n\nThere is one further reason we should study grief in other animals, says Dr King.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t just raise the issue of animal welfare \u2013 it also points to animal rights,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we understand the profound depths of emotions animals can feel, this should make us question the existence of zoos and slaughterhouses around the world, and rethink those systems. Because at present there is a tremendous solace in understanding that the grief we ourselves feel is shared by all kinds of animals worldwide.\u201d\n\nBy Zoe Cormier\n\nFeatured image by Dan Steel/Getty"

    "text": "As a newly minted Beijinger, there were certain things my brain quickly scrambled to make room for: the exact time I needed to leave home in the mornings to avoid being squashed into human dumpling filling on the rush-hour subway ride; the location of the best spots for mala xiang guo (a stir-fried version of hot pot); to never flush toilet paper; and to never, ever attempt eating a soup dumpling by putting it straight into your mouth (poke and slurp, people!).\n\nOne task, though, seemed impossible: remembering my QQ number, a string of randomly assigned digits that served as the user identification for the QQ messaging service our office \u2013 and many others in China \u2013 used.\n\nIt seemed living in China meant being constantly bombarded by numbers\n\nAs the only foreign employee in my department, I was also clearly the only one with this problem. My Chinese co-workers had no difficulty rattling off their own 10-digit, or in some cases nine-digit, IDs. No-one else felt the need to run over to his or her computer like a total idiot to check every time someone asked them. In case you didn\u2019t realise, that idiot was/is me. Since that day two years ago, when a colleague helped me set it up, I\u2019ve never once signed out of my QQ account, nervous that I\u2019ll not be able to log back in at all. If you asked me what my QQ ID was, after more than 104 weeks of living in China and using this messaging service, I would not be able to tell you.\n\nI once asked the British guy working in the office next to ours if he remembered his. He did not. Neither could my two American friends. \u201cWhat do those numbers mean?\u201d we\u2019d whined to each other. \u201cThere\u2019s no order of any kind to them. Why not just use letters?!\u201d I had been tempted to place the blame squarely on our collective terrible memories but turns out, there was possibly more to this. None of the locals we\u2019d asked seemed to find anything unusual about remembering not only long strings of QQ digits, but also various other sets of numbers in other areas of their everyday lives. They turned up in website domain names. They were part of internet slang. Certain numbers assumed significance in cultural beliefs: some were auspicious; others were to be fled from at all cost. Once I started looking, it seemed living in China meant being constantly bombarded by numbers, much more so than in other countries and cultures. And none of my Chinese co-workers or friends were quite sure why.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard the train fares on the CTrip website are kinda high,\u201d my Sichuanese roommate Panbi told me, back when I first moved here, as we discussed my Chinese New Year travel plans. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try 12306?\u201d\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 How India gave us the zero\n\n\u2022 Japan\u2019s unusual way to view the world\n\n\u2022 The country that can\u2019t slow down\n\n\u201cUm. Is that a helpline number?\u201d I\u2019d asked, adding that I wasn\u2019t sure my Mandarin skills were up to scratch yet. Turns out, no, it wasn\u2019t a helpline. 12306.cn is China Rail\u2019s official website and app. You know, just like email service websites 163.com and 126.com. While trying to find out exactly why all of them were named thusly, I found a very puzzled (non-Chinese) user\u2019s post on a software company\u2019s forum. \u201cAre 126.com and 163.com fake email addresses?\u201d he asked, with some consternation. \u201cI noticed a number of email addresses for our members with [these] domain [names]. From what I've been able to tell via limited research, these domains could potentially be fake.\u201d Other users quickly clarified that they were legitimate addresses. No-one, though, explained why.\n\nOr wait, almost no-one. Turns out the reason was likely the same as the one behind every one of my life choices: it involved the least effort. As Frankie Huang, a writer and strategist based in Shanghai, told me over email, numbers are far easier to type for purposes like websites\u2019 names, as compared to pinyin, the Romanised system for Chinese characters.\n\n\u201cNot everyone in China has perfect grasp of pinyin. If websites have pinyin names, it might actually be difficult for some people to figure out which letters to write,\u201d she said. A string of numbers is easier to commit to memory than words in a foreign language.\n\nAlso, because numbers involve just a single keystroke, you can type much faster. \u201cThis was a particular advantage back when phones had real keypads and you had to hit number keys multiple times for letters,\u201d Huang added. \u201cNobody has time for that.\u201d\n\nUnlike the QQ IDs, the digits in a website name usually aren\u2019t random, explains Christopher Beam in his New Republic essay. For instance, 163.com is the website address of Chinese internet company NetEase. It\u2019s a throwback to the days of dial-up, when customers had to enter 163 to go online. \u201cThe phone companies China Telecom and China Unicom simply re-appropriated their well-known customer service numbers as domain names, 10086.cn and 10010.cn, respectively.\u201d\n\nThis is also where homophones get involved. Though \u20181\u2019 is called yi in Mandarin, when pronounced as part of a string of numbers, it turns into yao. Among e-commerce conglomerate Alibaba\u2019s various platforms is 1688.com, with the numbers pronounced \u2018yao-lio-ba-ba\u2019 in Mandarin. Get it?\n\nSome, like McDonald\u2019s (phonetically translated in Mandarin as \u2018Maidanglao\u2019, until they changed their name in 2017) decided to get more creative. You can order your McMuffin online by typing 4008-517-517.cn because \u2018517\u2019 in Mandarin is \u2018wu yao qi\u2019. Almost like \u2018wo yao chuh\u2019 or \u2018I want to eat\u2019 (\u2018chuh\u2019 is the closest phonetic spelling for \u2018chi\u2019, the actual word for \u2018eat\u2019). Website 51job.com sounds awfully close to \u2018I want a job\u2019, and the \u20186\u2019 in video-streaming site 6.cn\u2019s address is a near-homophone for \u2018to stream\u2019, writes Beam. All Chinese digits are monosyllabic, making them easier to remember as sounds, or a short, catchy chant.\n\nWhile this societal fascination with numbers truly becomes apparent once you have lived in China long-term, it\u2019s often something tourists might notice too. The first time I encountered the cultural quirk was years ago, on my first trip here. I was in the city of Taizhou, spending a few days with my dad. He worked there, flying back and forth between Taizhou and Mumbai every couple of months. On my way up to his apartment, I noticed the lift panel had no fourth floor. There was 1, there was 2 and then there were 3A and 3B. Months later, when I had moved to China myself, I kept coming across elevators that had resolutely decided to not acknowledge 4.\n\nThe reason is that the pronunciation of the word \u2018four\u2019 in Mandarin sounds way too close for comfort to the word for \u2018death\u2019. Which, in the case of the more-orthodox Chinese people, necessitated banishing the number entirely. A co-worker gently suggested I remove one of the four hand-painted coasters I had brought from India for my boss before presenting them to her. My real estate agent informed me, strictly off-record, that often, apartments numbered 4 or 44 tended to be rented out to foreigners. \u201cMany times, the local Chinese people don\u2019t want to live there,\u201d she said, instantly making me remember house 44 inside Qianmachang Hutong in Beijing, where my very American ex-boyfriend had lived.\n\nHuang says her apartment building in Shanghai is \u201can extreme example of numerical superstition\u201d. It ascribes to not only Chinese, but also Western numerology. Along with leaving out floors 4, 14, 24 and 34, it has also done away with 13. \u201cOnce, I was looking at our building from the outside with my husband and we tried to figure out which floor was ours by counting up,\u201d Huang recalled. \u201c[We then realised] that the floor numbers are meaningless as they're all wrong.\u201d 13 was actually 14; 23 was actually 20.\n\nNumber 8, on the other hand, is the luckiest, as it sounds like the Mandarin word for prosperity. Car number plates with multiple 8\u2019s have likely been paid a fortune for by their owners, and the ornate \u201888\u2019 building number outside Mr Shi\u2019s Dumplings in Beijing is essentially an announcement to any potential competitors that they are doing very well indeed, thank you very much. If you happen to get an 888 in your phone number, you could likely sell it for a pretty good price.\n\nNumbers also lend a sense of solidness, apparent from the government\u2019s fondness for incorporating them into official policies. There\u2019s the \u2018Four Comprehensives\u2019 put forth by Chinese President Xi Jinping, another heartening moment of redemption for the number 4 after Chairman Mao advocated for the destruction of the \u2018Four Olds\u2019 \u2013 Old Ideas, Old Culture, Old Customs, and Old Habits \u2013 during the Cultural Revolution. Because official policies are kept separate from cultural superstition, it\u2019s irrelevant how \u201clucky\u201d a number is. Former General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Jiang Zemin had the \u2018Three Represents\u2019. Xi\u2019s predecessor Hu Jintao had the slightly more bluesy-sounding \u2018Three Supremes\u2019, but then made up for it with the very serious \u2018Eight Honours and Eight Shames\u2019 \u2013 also the title of the lecture my Indian parents gave me the second I hit puberty.\n\nThen there\u2019s the wide, wild world of Chinese internet slang, where dodging censors (or just nosy parents) means homophonic numerals are popular. So 748 is telling someone to go to hell, 555 basically means a crying emoji, 233 means you\u2019re laughing, and 520 is \u2018I love you\u2019. And if you wanted to really kick it up a few notches, there\u2019s 2010000, which means \u2018I love you for 10,000 years\u2019.

    "title": "Is men\u2019s make-up going mainstream?",
    "authors": [
      "Bel Jacobs"
    ],
    "text": "This month, David Beckham appears on the cover of style magazine LOVE 20.5, in Dior, styled by Kim Jones, green roses and bird tattoos spiralling up his neck. \u201cWith the lighting and the pose, David reminded me of David Sylvian from [1970s and \u201880s band] Japan,\u201d says make-up artist Miranda Joyce, who worked on the shoot. \u201cIt seemed right to add eye make-up, the bright blue that Bowie wore in the Life on Mars video. I knew David could make it work, even though it wasn\u2019t something he\u2019d done before.\u201d It\u2019s a great portrait \u2013 and yet what really got people talking was that eyeshadow.\n\nMen are no strangers to make-up. Alexander the Great was a fan, while the Picts daubed their faces in blue woad. Wigs and beauty spots were popular in the court of Louis XIII \u2013 and let\u2019s not forget the dandies. But somewhere in the 1800s, someone decided that real men don\u2019t wear make-up and, after that, when they did, it was in a spirit of transgression. Bowie, Prince and Johnny Depp weren\u2019t (just) trying to make themselves look good, they were challenging everything we knew about gender, sex and society.\n\nWho decides what is cool?\n\nIs this the end for real fur?\n\nDries van Noten on the craft of fashion\n\nBut, off the back of the LOVE cover, is men\u2019s make-up about to go mainstream? After all, here you have one of today\u2019s most famous faces wearing the stuff. Factor in men\u2019s cosmetic line launches by Chanel and Tom Ford, and male make-up artists Manny Gutierrez and James Charles fronting campaigns for US mega brands Maybelline and Covergirl respectively \u2013 and you have all the beginnings of a movement. Plus Gutierrez and Charles are part of a powerful influencer group of men in make-up, including Jeffree Star and others.\n\nIn January 2019, when Charles visited Birmingham in the UK to launch a palette with Morphe, traffic literally stopped. Look beyond the screaming, however, and the status quo has hardly shifted. BOY de Chanel (tagline 'Be Only You') is a streamlined collection of only three products \u2013 foundation, eyebrow pencil and lip balm \u2013 in matte-black packaging that hardly challenges conventional notions of masculinity. And the boys in make-up? They\u2019re mostly beautiful, gay, prone to hyperbole \u2013 and up to 80% of their million-strong fanbase appear to be young girls.\n\nWhy are men still so resistant to ideas of facial decoration? \u201cWell, they\u2019re told to be,\u201d says Glen Jankowski, lecturer in the School of Social Sciences at Leeds Beckett University. \u201cDespite claims of increasing metrosexuality, gender norms for men are still strong. Analyses of toys marketed to boys, for example, show that the messages are still to be strong, brave and uninvested in your appearance. For girls, beauty is key.\u201d Understanding the divide came as a shock to the transgender make-up artist Joseph Harwood.\n\n\u201cI was the tiny kid with glittery gel pens,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI didn't appreciate how powerful conditioning could be until the people who mistook me for female told me what was wrong with my skin. It became evident that the boys and girls had different expectations \u2013 and I didn't fit with either. Men are often praised for flaws; a broken nose is rugged, chapped skin is war-torn [but] there\u2019s a full-blown campaign from the start of a girl\u2019s life that involves images on magazines that are overly retouched.\u201d\n\nThe male-grooming business is growing exponentially\n\nToday, Harwood lends his face to gender-free and vegan make-up brand Jecca Blac. But if men aren\u2019t quite ready for rouge, they\u2019re definitely up for a bit of spit and polish. The male-grooming business, valued at $57.7billion (\u00a344.6billion) in 2017, is growing exponentially. According to Research and Markets, the market is set to reach a quite staggering $78.6billion (\u00a360.6billion) by 2023. And we\u2019re not just talking Nivea; we\u2019re talking moisturising foundation and bronzers, concealers and brow definers \u2013 proper cosmetics.\n\nAlex Dalley isn\u2019t surprised. He set up men\u2019s make-up range MMUK in 2012, after an adolescence plagued by acne \u2013 until his mum put some foundation on him. \u201cAt the beginning, we had eight or nine products and the bravest things we had were a clear brow gel and a concealer stick. But, over the years, customers starting asking for foundations and bronzers.\u201d Today, the brand has about 60 products and is stocked on Asos. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different landscape,\u201d affirms Dalley.\n\nBlend it like Beckham\n\nDaniel Gray launched his proudly vegan, cruelty-free and produced-in-Britain men\u2019s make-up brand War Paint almost two years ago. \u201cGrooming has exploded,\" he says. \u201cWe started selling online on 1 November and I\u2019m already taking on more staff. There\u2019s a massive market for this, and it looks set to grow. What we want men to realise is that, when you say make-up, we don\u2019t just mean red lipstick. Make-up is putting a nice base on so that you can have an even skin tone and feel the best you can.\u201d\n\nDo men really want to get stuck into colour and shine anyway? As most women will testify, the daily routine of \u2018putting on your face\u2019 can be double-edged. On one hand, you have the confidence of presenting your best, unblemished self to the world; on the other, you know it\u2019s not the full picture. In a recent article in the Independent, feminist activist Julie Bindel pointed out that \u201c15% of heterosexual women polled about their so-called beauty regimes disclosed that they apply make-up before their partner wakes up.\u201d What a chore.\n\nBeckham in make-up communicates a certain liberation from the norm \u2013 Miranda Joyce\n\nWomen in the UK also spend an average of 474 days applying make-up, during which time they slather up to 200 synthetic chemicals onto their faces and fork out an average of \u00a39,525 over a lifetime keeping up with trends. \u201cMake-up for a lot of women has become a necessity, something they don\u2019t feel confident without,\u201d admits Miranda Joyce. \u201cI really wish make up could be seen as a more liberating, playful, expressive device. If the perspective shifted, maybe men would feel more inclined to experiment.\u201d\n\nBecause, it could be argued that the more lines are blurred between the sexes, the better life will be for everyone. \u201cMasculinity is still such a fragile concept; the fact that Beckham wearing eyeliner is headline news shows how little things have changed,\u201d says LGBT activist Jeffrey Ingold, \u201cSuicide rates among young men are alarmingly high and part of the [reason for that] is the culture of toxic masculinity that restricts what\u2019s acceptable for men to do. Not feeling you can be yourself is incredibly damaging to a person\u2019s mental well-being.\u201d\n\nSeeing more men experiment with appearance using make-up would be a sign we\u2019re expanding the idea of \"what it means to be a man,\u201d says Ingold. Joyce agrees: \u201cWhile gender fluidity is in the spotlight, we\u2019re still a patriarchal society. Beckham in make-up communicates a certain liberation from the norm; he\u2019s a sportsman and a businessman and a style leader and, on the cover, I think he personifies modern masculinity, confident to step out of his comfort zone and experiment.\u201d\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "title": "Can detoxing help your gut health?",
    "authors": [
      "Claudia Hammond"
    ],
    "text": "If you\u2019ve over-indulged of late, then the idea of detox may well appeal \u2013 flushing out the Christmas and New Year excesses, and negotiating the start of the year afresh. There are plenty of products that offer help, from detox massages and smoothies to herbal teas and starvation diets. You can find promises of glowing skin, weight loss and a healthier you that can help you shrug off the sluggishness of mid-winter. Rinsing your system of impurities sounds like a good way to start the year, but is there any evidence that it works?\n\nThe word detox is used in two very different ways. The first refers to the medical detoxification programmes that help people with a serious alcohol or drug problems to get clean.\n\nThe other is the kind of home detox marketed to us with promises to rid our bodies of \u201ctoxins\u201d. Modern life does, of course, bring us into contact with plenty of synthetic chemicals and natural substances, some of which can be toxic, but how much evidence is there that a detox will eliminate them from our bodies?\n\nYou might also like:\n\nIt is true that the day you cut out alcohol and embark on a healthier diet, toxins will leave your body. But this happens every day, not just when you drink raw vegetable juice. The body already has its own clever system to rid itself of toxins. If it didn\u2019t, we\u2019d be in trouble. All over the body, work is taking place to keep out or eliminate toxins \u2013 from our skin acting as a barrier to the fine hairs in our respiratory system trapping particles in mucus so we can sneeze them out.\n\nPart of the gut contains special lymphatic cells called Peyer\u2019s patches, which form bundles in the mucous membrane lining. Found in the lowest part of the small intestine, the shape of these patches allows them to identify and screen out harmful particles so that they are not absorbed into the bloodstream alongside the beneficial nutrients from our food. Although we might have a sense that our intestines are somehow dirty and in need of cleansing, they\u2019re just doing their job.\n\nMeanwhile your kidneys filter half a cup of blood a minute, excreting toxins such as urea out of the body as urine.\n\nWhen it comes to alcohol, it\u2019s the liver that has the job of detoxing you. It\u2019s a two-step process. First alcohol is converted by enzymes into acetaldehyde, which is toxic, but this is quickly converted into acetic acid, then carbon dioxide and water. If you drink faster than your liver can metabolise the alcohol, then it can\u2019t keep up and your blood alcohol level will rise.\n\nIf you persistently drink to excess, acetaldehyde can damage the liver. But the liver can successfully detoxify the body from more moderate amounts of alcohol. It\u2019s another of the mobile detox systems we carry round with us all the time.\n\nGood evidence in favour of detox diets is lacking\n\nSo do special detox diets work? They range from those where you simply cut out alcohol, caffeine and refined sugar to much stricter diets where you only drink liquids for several days, before gradually reintroducing small amounts of food. In 2012 Edzard Ernst, emeritus professor of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter, attempted a systematic review of the literature, but found it impossible to isolate enough studies on this kind of home detox because literature searches also threw up the many studies on drug detox programmes.\n\nIn 2014 two Sydney-based researchers did succeed in publishing a review of studies on detox diets. They couldn\u2019t find any randomised controlled trials of commercial detox diets, although they did find a small number of studies without control groups.\n\nThe life inside all of us Microbes & me is a new collaborative series between BBC Future and BBC Good Food. In the series, we\u2019ll be looking at recent research into the microbiome of bacteria that lives in all of us. We\u2019ll be exploring how it affects our health, what could be having detrimental effects on it, and recommending recipes that might help it thrive.\n\nFor example in research on a seven-day-detox diet, conducted with just 25 people in 2000, people felt healthier afterwards and there was a trend towards improved liver function, but the improvement was not statistically significant.\n\nThey also found small trials looking at the elimination of particular toxins from the body, but again most were small, didn\u2019t include controls or had other flaws, leading the authors to conclude that good evidence in favour of detox diets is lacking.\n\nThat leaves us reliant on anecdote. People who go on crash diets or juice fasts usually do lose weight in the short-term, but it\u2019s hard to find evidence that the weight stays off in the long-term.\n\nSo should you bother with a detox? When it comes to alcohol, it\u2019s healthier to avoid it for several days every week of the year than for a few weeks in a single detox. Spending a period of time focussing on eating more fruit and vegetables is of course beneficial for your health too. A quick fix is not going to work as well as pledging to eat a Mediterranean diet and to exercise for the rest of your life.\n\nPerhaps we should think of a detox as more of a metaphor for shedding your old habits\n\nBut the idea of detox is something many find appealing. If it feels good to punish yourself to compensate for your over-indulgence, maybe it\u2019s your sins rather than your toxins that you\u2019re keen to wash away. But if you can hack it, it\u2019s possible that psychologically, a detox could provide a new start \u2013 a break between your old habits and the new ones you\u2019d like to acquire. However, you need to have a plan for what happens next or your old habits will return.\n\nPerhaps we should think of a detox as more of a metaphor for shedding your old habits, rather than something that flushes impurities from your gut and your organs. Your body is constantly detoxing itself without special teas, juices or diets.\n\nBut you can help it to do its job by eating a healthily diet, drinking water, taking regular exercise and getting the sleep you need.\n\n--\n\nDisclaimer\n\nAll content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional.

    "authors": [],
    "text": "The history of the British chippy\n\nWhy did fish and chips become so popular in the UK?\n\nProfessor Murray Pittock, a cultural historian at Glasgow University, thinks the answer lies in Italy. By 1918 there were about 4000 Italians in Scotland, with many starting up fish and chip businesses. 2019 will see the 38th Fish and Chip Festival in Lucca in Italy, supporting the theory that the dish was brought from Barga to Scotland in the late 19th century and that \u201cultimately it\u2019s an Italian dish.\u201d\n\nAlthough \u201cyou can\u2019t be absolutely sure where it comes from in the end,\u201d says Murray, \u201cthere does seem to be \u2013 whether it\u2019s Iberia or Italian \u2013 a Mediterranean fried fish tinge\u2026 to the native creation of fish and chips.\u201d\n\nFood writer Claudia Roden thinks \u201cthe Italians got it from the Jews\u201d. During Hanukkah, the 8-day Jewish festival of light, it is traditional to eat fried food dishes like sufganiyot (jam-filled doughnuts) and latkes (potato fritters). In 1860, says the food writer, the first fish fryer putting fish and chips together was a London-based Jew from Russia called Joseph Malin. The Jewish tradition of frying fish met with the Irish potato shops of the East End, and voila, the British national dish was made."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "A Glasgow writer has been swallowed up by social media after revealing she can taste people's names.\n\nJulie McDowall sees nothing out of the ordinary in being able to measure a word - or a name - by the taste it gives her.\n\nAfter revealing on Twitter that she had a condition which means she can describe the tastes she experiences when she hears a word, she was bombarded with millions of requests.\n\nImage copyright Greggs Image caption Ross - you are a Greggs sausage roll\n\nJulie said: \"I have a neurological condition, synaesthesia, which sounds serious but is actually quite funny.\n\n\"It means that when I hear a word, I can automatically taste something. Sometimes I can get a sensation or an image, but mostly it's just a taste.\n\n\"Other people have different versions of synaesthesia where they hear music or see colours but with me I am assaulted by tastes and strange images.\n\nWhat is Synaesthesia?\n\nSynaesthesia is a recognised medical condition. It has been described as a \"union of the senses\" where two or more of the five senses are involuntarily and automatically joined together.\n\nSome synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells, shapes or touches in almost any combination. These sensations are automatic and cannot be turned on or off.\n\nSynaesthesia is not a disease or illness and is not harmful.\n\nJulie has 'lexical-gustatory synesthesia' which relates to taste and words.\n\nJulie has the condition, as does her sister and mother.\n\nBut she was completely unaware that everyone else couldn't taste words and names until she was eight years old.\n\nJulie said: \"My aunt was pregnant and she took my sister and I to a chip shop for some chips and cola to celebrate.\n\n\"She said: 'Girls, I'm thinking of baby names, what do you think about Sarah? And my sister and I were utterly disgusted and told her Sarah is greasy hair, it's disgusting'. She just looked at us and said what on earth are you talking about?\n\n\"She was confused but we were also confused and said: 'How can you not understand what that means - of course it's greasy hair'.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Sorry, Sarah\n\nJulie likens the feeling to a background hum, like being at home and hearing the birds or the traffic outside. She says it doesn't interfere, it is just simply there.\n\nShe considers this gift to be a party trick. And she says it relaxes her away from her day job as a nuclear journalist.\n\nShe told BBC Radio Scotland's John Beattie programme: \"I spend all my time writing and podcasting about nuclear horror and nuclear dread and coping with the threat of the four-minute warning.\n\n\"Last Sunday I had released a podcast about nuclear war, what would you do in the last four minutes before the bomb drops? Very grim. So for a change I thought I would tweet something funny.\n\n\"So I tweeted to say I can taste your names, let me know what your name is and I'll taste it.\"\n\nShe received more than six million notifications over a 24-hour period.\n\nWhat's in a name? A selection of Julie's taste observations\n\nAaron - stale chocolate bar\n\nAnn - a dusty brass ornament\n\nAmelia - muesli\n\nBrian - shreds of coconut\n\nCharlotte - raspberry lollipop\n\nDanielle - spaghetti hoops\n\nDonald - rubber duck dipped in vinegar\n\nDuncan - smoky bacon crisps burp\n\nGrace - a soft turnip in vegetable soup\n\nGraham - cold stew\n\nHannah - tasteless banana\n\nImage copyright Thinkstock Image caption Hannah - this is you\n\nJack - old battered leather footstool that's been kicked around a bit\n\nJames - raindrops on a window pane\n\nJohn - leathery button on an old man's cardigan\n\nJesus - Maltesers\n\nMadison - ear wax with chocolate\n\nMarie - a wooden varnished statue with real human hair\n\nRoss - Greggs sausage roll\n\nSam - tuna\n\nSean - mouthful of furniture polish\n\nSharon - stale Cadbury's Flake\n\nSophie - foam shrimp sweets\n\nWendy - watered-down orange juice\n\nJulie and her sister have different tastes for names.\n\nJulie tastes Jennifer's name as a pin dipped in vinegar, and Jennifer tastes Julie as \"a wee chocolate statue of me\".\n\nJulie believes their shared experience brings them closer and would not change it.\n\nShe said: \"It is really entertaining, especially when I'm with Jen and we can compare names and laugh at the strange tastes and images which are thrown up.\n\n\"It has also brought joy to some people on Twitter.\n\n\"I'm thinking particularly of the woman who was in fits of laughter to find her name, Pamela, made me feel that I was squeezing a My Little Pony's bottom...\"\n\nIt has now been suggested to Julie that she writes a book about baby names.\n\nShe said: \"But I have a book coming out soon about nuclear history and that might clash!\n\n\"Maybe once I have got the nuclear book under my belt I can dabble in the synaesthesia baby names!\""

      "Bbc News"
    ],
    "text": "Image copyright AFP Image caption Lawyers say social media has thrown the norms of copyright law into chaos\n\nCelebrities and the paparazzi have a notoriously tense relationship. From accusations of invasion of privacy to criticism of unflattering photos, stars have regularly hit out at those who are paid to pursue them.\n\nBut in the last couple of years, a new wave of complaints has started flowing from the other side.\n\nA number of well-known celebrities, including Jennifer Lopez and model Gigi Hadid, have had lawsuits filed against them for posting paparazzi images on their social media accounts.\n\nSo what exactly is going on with these copyright disputes?\n\nYou might think that being the subject of an image means you can use it freely.\n\nBut according to copyright law, it's the photographer who usually owns an image's rights unless it's been licensed to a third party like their agency or employer.\n\nSo whether you're a celebrity who has been papped leaving the latest Hollywood hotspot or someone who posed for a friend, the ownership of the photograph typically falls to the person who pressed the button.\n\nNeel Chatterjee, a US lawyer who specialises in high-profile intellectual property disputes, says social media has created an \"enormous amount of complexity\" in the field.\n\nHe says in part the problem is caused because functions like online re-tweets allow images to proliferate quickly far beyond the control of the copyright holder.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Selfies (like those popularised by heiress Paris Hilton) are safe from such disputes\n\nIn recent lawsuits, photograph agencies have claimed that it's not fair for celebrities to reproduce and distribute their images to their millions of fans without license. Some have even appealed for compensation for loss of earnings.\n\nThe stakes are made even higher because of the monetary value of some of the social media feeds in question, with some earning up to $1m per sponsored post on platforms like Instagram.\n\nKhloe Kardashian was among the first people to be publicly pursued in one of these copyright cases.\n\nShe was sued for infringement in 2017 after posting a paparazzi photograph of herself visiting a Miami restaurant on her Instagram feed.\n\nXposure Photos, a UK based agency, sought damages of more than $175,000 for the post.\n\nThey said the image, which had been exclusively licensed to the Daily Mail, was used by Khloe without their permission and their accreditation had been erased.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Khloe and Kim Kardashian are among those who have spoken out again the crackdown\n\nThey argued her post, shared to almost 67m followers, constituted \"wilful, intentional, and malicious\" infringement of their copyright.\n\nKardashian eventually deleted the image and both sides agreed to dismiss the suit last year.\n\nBut the star has acknowledged the row is an ongoing problem for her and her sisters.\n\nShe told Twitter fans that it might take longer for her to share images from events because she had to obtain proper permission first.\n\n\"I have to license my own image which blows my mind,\" she said in reply to one fan.\n\n\"They can legally stalk me and harass me and then on top of it all I can't even use the pictures of myself they take LOL,\" she tweeted to another.\n\nLast week, model Gigi Hadid became the latest star to be slapped with a lawsuit over an image she posted of herself.\n\nA complaint against the model alleges that her Instagram account \"includes at least 50 examples of uncredited photographs of Hadid in public, at press events, or on the runway\".\n\nImage copyright Gotham via Getty Images Image caption Gigi Hadid revealed in October she was being \"legally pursued\" over a photograph\n\nIt was reported last month that Jennifer Lopez is being sued in a similar case involving an image posted on her Instagram story - a temporary post that disappears after 24 hours.\n\nThey are several more examples of a similar nature and the problem looks unlikely to go away.\n\nThe rise of 'copyright trolling'\n\nMr Chatterjee says these cases are becoming known within the industry as \"copyright trolling\".\n\nHe believes photo agencies are exploring it as a \"new and incremental way\" of increasing their revenue streams.\n\n\"They're going to take a picture outside a nightclub or restaurant whether or no they have a relationship with this famous person or not,\" he says, when asked if paparazzi should be worried about offending stars.\n\nAnd it's not just celebrities themselves being targeted.\n\nA number of so-called \"fan accounts\" have also reported being aggressively pursued on copyright grounds, with some apparently being shutdown altogether in the process.\n\nWhen some Kardashian fans complained about the problem last year, Kim said her family was even considering hiring their own photographers to try and bypass the problem.\n\n\"It's just one of those things that offends common sense,\" Mr Chatterjee says of the copyright law.\n\n\"If someone's harassing me and takes a photograph of me and I happen to like the picture and want to make use of it, after they harassed me and made money from me - now they can sue me for that?\"\n\nHe also cast doubt on accusations of loss of earnings.\n\n\"If you look at Kylie Jenner for example,\" he says. \"You know when she promotes something, her distribution is so much broader that anything these agencies would be able to achieve.\n\n\"In some ways they amp up the iconic nature of some of these images.\"\n\nDo the celebrities have a defence?\n\nUS National Football League (NFL) star Odell Beckham Jnr is another person embroiled in a legal battle involving paparazzi.\n\nThe player, who has more than 12 million Instagram followers, accused one agency of extortion last year after allegedly receiving a demand for a $40,000 payment over an image he had shared.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nReports regarding the lawsuit said he wanted to defend himself over his \"rights to publicity\" - conditions within some states' laws which protect a person's right to control how their name or likeness is used commercially.\n\nThe defence has been used before.\n\nIn 2014 actress Katherine Heigl sued a US drugstore chain after they used a paparazzi image of her carrying the pharmacy's shopping bags for promotion on social media. That case was eventually dropped, apparently in return for the post's deletion and a confidential donation to a charity.\n\nBut, as Mr Chatterjee points out, this defence in regards to paparazzi copyright complaints remains complex and largely untested in case law.\n\nOf the lawsuits filed against celebrities so far, many have been dismissed or settled before being litigated to resolution.\n\n\"You'll see people offering to settle for say $10-20,000,\" he says, \"Which seems like a lot of money but in context of litigation costs it's really not that much - especially for these high profile figures.\"\n\n\"It's going to take someone like a Kardashian who has tons of money who sees other commercial benefits by litigating these questions. It very well may take someone like that to actually fight this stuff.\""

    "text": "In 1975, three years after the final Apollo Moon landing, Space: 1999 first aired on British television. It began with a nuclear explosion wrenching the Moon, and an international lunar colony of over 300 people, out of its orbit and into an unknown journey into space.\n\nThe TV series obviously made an impression on a young Elon Musk because, when the SpaceX founder revealed their plans for a lunar colony in August 2017, he called it Moonbase Alpha after the lunar base in Space: 1999. \u201cCheesy show,\u201d Musk tweeted, \u201cbut I loved it.\u201d\n\nSpaceX is not alone is wanting to get humans back on the Moon. The Chinese space agency CNSA (China National Space Administration) has announced the next stages of its successful Chang\u2019e lunar exploration missions - shortly after Chang\u2019e 4 became the first spacecraft to make a soft landing on the far side of the Moon.\n\nChang\u2019e 5 and 6 will be sample return missions while Chang\u2019e 7 will survey the South Pole, a region of specific interest for human habitation because it contains water ice. \u201cWe hope that Chang'e 8 will help test some technologies and do some exploring,\u201d deputy head of the CNSA Wu Yanhua said in January, \u201cfor the building of a joint lunar base shared by multiple countries.\u201d\n\nYou might also like:\n\nChina is not alone in this ambition. Across the globe, 50 years after the Moon landings, the practicalities of a moonbase are taking shape. The irony is that, while only the United States of America has left footprints on the Moon, the Americans are now having to play catch up. It didn\u2019t unveil plans for a permanent moonbase until August 2018. Nasa\u2019s primary focus until then had been Mars. The European Space Agency (Esa) was already one step ahead.\n\nMoon village\n\nEsa announced plans for a permanent lunar base in 2016. Pioneered by its new director-general, Jan Woerner, his vision for a \u2018Moon village\u2019 would contain a diverse population of people \u2013 from scientists to artists \u2013 and both public and private organisations. This could be for astronomical research, tourism or geological prospecting for minerals in short supply on Earth.\n\nHe was definitely ahead of the curve. Ariel Ekblaw, founder of the MIT Media Lab\u2019s Space Exploration Initiative, also wants to \u201cdemocratise space\u201d and, to this end, has brought together multi-disciplinary research groups ranging from robotics and synthetic neurobiology to architecture, art, space and design.\n\nNot everyone used to think this way but Esa science advisor, Aidan Cowley, also welcomed Woerner\u2019s idea as he was one of the first to work on lunar technologies at Esa\u2019s European Astronaut Centre in Cologne, Germany. \u201cAt first every one looked at me as if I had a second head,\u201d he laughs, \u201cso for me it\u2019s been very satisfying to see the uptick in interest and this focus on the Moon. Jan read the tea leaves.\u201d\n\nUnlike Nasa, which has an exclusion policy for working with China on spaceflight, Esa also collaborates with CNSA. \u201cLast year we had Esa astronauts Matthais Maurer and Samantha Cristoforretti participating with Chinese colleagues on sea rescue and survival,\u201d says Cowley.\n\nNasa aims to land astronauts on the lunar surface by 2030 and is planning a lunar orbiting platform called the Gateway. Private companies are heading to the Moon too. Blue Origin, for instance, is partnering with OHB and MT Aerospace on its Blue Moon cargo ship for a lunar landing. But whichever organisation gets there first, the key priority will be survival. The longest time humans have lived on the Moon so far is just three days. For longer stays, it\u2019s not the most welcoming of destinations.\n\nDestination Moon\n\nThe Moon has temperatures ranging from 127 to -173 C (260 to -343F). Then there\u2019s radiation and the low gravity, one-sixth that of the Earth\u2019s. A lunar day is also around 29 Earth days, which means two weeks of daylight followed by two weeks of darkness \u2013 an issue for solar power. Any new technologies for a lunar outpost must therefore work under these conditions.\n\nThe competition will last five years because the ambition of The Moon Race is to bring the best team\u2019s idea up to the Moon\u2019s surface - Pierre-Alexis Joumel\n\nWith this endeavour in mind, several organisations \u2013 including Blue Origin, Airbus Defence and Space and Esa \u2013 recently helped set up a non-profit organisation called The Moon Race. This global competition is to encourage companies to develop technologies in the areas of manufacturing, energy production, resources (filling a bottle with lunar water) and biology (to sustain the first lunar greenhouse) and will officially launch in October 2019 at the International Astronautical Congress.\n\n\u201cWe will issue guidelines and rules within the next month,\u201d says Germany-based Airbus space engineer and Moon Race co-founder, Pierre-Alexis Joumel. \u201cThe competition will last five years because the ambition of The Moon Race is to bring the best team\u2019s idea up to the Moon\u2019s surface.\u201d\n\nThe technology prototypes selected for testing under lunar conditions will hitch a ride onboard a lunar mission. \u201cThe missions we are targeting are mostly from space agencies. One is planned for 2024-25.\u201d\n\nBuilding a home\n\nDespite the imaginative concept art of early moonbases, the reality is more basic. And grey. Travelling to the Moon is expensive. The heavier the payload, the more fuel required and the higher the cost. Building a living space out of the Moon\u2019s available resources makes sense. There\u2019s the potential of using lava tubes, tunnels formed during the Moon\u2019s volcanic past, as shelters with access to frozen water ice beneath the surface. But a more immediate plan is to build a habitat using lunar regolith, the fine dark balsaltic grey sand that is similar to volcanic sand on Earth.\n\nProfessor Matthias Sperl from the University of Cologne works with the German Space Agency, DLR, using volcanic powder to make bricks. The regolith simulant is held together using a process called sintering, where concentrated sunlight or lasers bond the material together. He used 3D printers to construct different shaped bricks to see which worked best. \u201cWhat we can build with current techniques and shapes is interlocking building elements,\u201d said Sperl. \u201cWe\u2019re not building Lego but we have interlocking bricks.\u201d\n\nThese bricks would \u201cbuild something like an igloo, then it\u2019s strong against additional pressure from above.\u201d The pressure would be from a metre layer or so of loose regolith, to offer a natural protection against radiation as there is no wind on the Moon to blow it away.\n\n\u201cYou need to bring a square metre or more big lens to capture the solar light to allow 3D sintering and printing of lunar dust,\u201d said Sperl. \u201cThen you need an astronaut or mostly likely a robot to bring those pieces together to bring together a settlement.\u201d\n\nOxygen within the lunar regolith itself could also be extracted for breathing\n\nBut building just one structure would be a slow process. \u201cIt takes roughly five hours to make a brick,\u201d said Sperl, \"and you need 10,000 bricks for an igloo. It will take months.\u201d\n\nThis time could be reduced if more lenses are in operation and construction is performed robotically, but it is a feasible plan. \u201cLunar regolith can build something as strong as concrete,\u201d said Sperl. \u201cCurrent technologies only give you one-fifth that strength, around that of gypsum, so further investment is needed to get to the ultimate strengths.\u201d\n\nThe next stage is sizing up. Fortunately construction will start later this year on a large Esa lunar facility that can help prepare for both technologies and living on the Moon.\n\nSurvival\n\nSince evidence of water ice was detected at the Moon\u2019s poles, and finally confirmed by Nasa in August last year, any moonbase is likely to be situated at these locations. It\u2019s no coincidence that Chang\u2019e 4\u2019s Yutu 2 rover is currently collecting information in the South Pole\u2019s Aitken Basin. The water ice can be found on the surface in permanently shadowed areas of craters and underground.\n\nOxygen within the lunar regolith itself could also be extracted for breathing. The most likely source is ilmenite (FeTiO3) which, when combined with hydrogen at temperatures of around 1,000C (1,832F), produces water vapour, which then needs to be separated to produce hydrogen and oxygen.\n\nTo begin with, astronauts will need to bring food and drink supplies. Chang\u2019e 4 caused excitement by germinating and sprouting a seed, but producing sustainable food in space is not a new idea. It began in 1982, when Soviet cosmonauts grew Arabidopsis thaliana, a member of the mustard family, on the Salyut 7 space station. In 2010 the University of Arizona developed a prototype \u2018lunar greenhouse\u2019 \u2013 a hydroponic system using a 5.5 metre membrane covered tube, water-cooled sodium vapour lamps and \u201cenvelopes\u201d to hold the seeds using carbon dioxide from astronauts\u2019 breath and urine to provide water. Fibre-optic cables supplied sunlight.\n\nEnergy\n\nNew energy technologies will be key to living on the Moon. Fuel cells on Earth require a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen (often from the air) to produce electricity, with water as a byproduct. While there\u2019s no atmosphere on the Moon, the ingredients are there.\n\n\u201cYou could split the water we have on the Moon and during the night recombine it to produce electricity,\u201d says Cowley, who is developing these new technologies. \u201cDuring the day we\u2019ve got a lot of solar power, probably excess to split the water into hydrogen and oxygen, so it\u2019s a unique tool we could use on the Moon to sustain a long duration mission.\u201d\n\nThere is also the potential of thermal energy storage using a process similar to heat pumps. \u201cOn the Moon we don\u2019t have convection as there\u2019s no wind so the heat from the Sun stays in the regolith,\u201d says Cowley. \u201cWe could use a lens or mirror to focus sunlight onto the ground and use that resource to keep a base warm or to generate electricity.\u201d\n\nOnce these technologies are perfected and tested to ensure they will work under lunar conditions, astronauts will be able to build a moonbase. It will be sooner than you think.\n\n--\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "text": "Image copyright NASA Image caption A Nasa graphic showing the global temperature anomalies between 2014 and 2018 - higher than the long term trend is shown in red\n\nThe world is in the middle of what is likely to be the warmest 10 years since records began in 1850, say scientists.\n\nThe Met Office is forecasting that temperatures for each of the next five years are likely to be 1C or more above pre-industrial levels.\n\nIn the next five years there's also a chance we'll see a year in which the average global temperature rise could be greater than 1.5C.\n\nThat's seen as a critical threshold for climate change.\n\nIf the data matches the forecast, then the decade from 2014-2023 will be the warmest in more than 150 years of record keeping.\n\nWill the forecast temperature rises bust the Paris climate agreement?\n\nThe Met Office says that 2015 was the first year in which the global annual average surface temperature reached 1C above the pre-industrial level, which is generally taken to mean the temperatures between 1850 and 1900.\n\nEach year since then, the global average has hovered close to or above the 1C mark. Now, the Met Office says that trend is likely to continue or increase over the next five years.\n\n\"We've just made this year's forecasts and they go out to 2023 and what they suggest is rapid warming globally,\" Prof Adam Scaife, head of long term forecasting at the Met Office, told BBC News.\n\n\"By looking at individual years in that forecast we can now see for the first time, there is a risk of a temporary, and I repeat temporary, exceedance of the all-important 1.5C threshold level set out in the Paris climate agreement.\"\n\nLast October, UN scientists published a special report on the long-term impacts of a temperature rise of 1.5C.\n\nThey concluded that it would take a massive carbon cutting effort to keep the world from tipping over the limit by 2030. The Met Office analysis now says there's a 10% chance of this happening within the next five years.\n\n\"It's the first time the forecasts have shown a significant risk of exceedance - it is only temporary. We are talking about individual years fluctuating above the 1.5 degree level,\" said Prof Scaife.\n\n\"But the fact that that can happen now due to a combination of general warming and the fluctuations due to things like El Ni\u00f1o events in the next few years does mean we are getting close to that threshold.\"\n\nImage copyright Met Office Image caption Temperature data for the five major global climate databases\n\nHow confident is the Met Office of its prediction?\n\nThe Met Office says it has a 90% confidence limit in the forecasts for the years ahead.\n\nIt says that from 2019 to 2023, we will see temperatures ranging from 1.03C to 1.57C above the 1850-1900 level, with enhanced warming over much of the globe, especially over areas like the Arctic.\n\nThe research team says it is pretty certain in its predictions because of its past experience. The team's previous forecast, made in 2013, predicted the rapid rate of warming that's been observed over the past five years. It even predicted some of the lesser known details such as the patch of cooling seen in the North Atlantic and the cooler spots in the Southern Ocean.\n\nSorry, your browser cannot display this map\n\nIf the observations over the next five years match the forecasts, then the decade between 2014 and 2023 will be the warmest in more than 150 years of records.\n\nWhat about other climate agencies?\n\nThe Met Office forecast comes as a number of agencies publish their full analysis of temperature data from 2018, showing it to be the fourth warmest since records began in 1850.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has published an analysis of five major international datasets showing that the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22.\n\n\"Temperatures are only part of the story. Extreme and high impact weather affected many countries and millions of people, with devastating repercussions for economies and ecosystems in 2018,\" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\n\"Many of the extreme weather events are consistent with what we expect from a changing climate. This is a reality we need to face up to. Greenhouse gas emission reduction and climate adaptation measures should be a top global priority,\" he said.\n\nOther researchers in the field said the new forecast for the next five years was in line with expectations, given the record level of CO2 pumped into the atmosphere in 2018.\n\n\"The forecast from the Met Office is, unfortunately, no surprise,\" said Dr Anna Jones, an atmospheric chemist at the British Antarctic Survey.\n\n\"Temperatures averaged across the globe are at a record all-time high, and have been for a number of years. They are driven predominantly by rising concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, that result from our continued use of fossil fuels.\n\n\"Until we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we can expect to see upward trends in global averaged temperatures.\"\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nKeeping Up Appearances' Clive Swift dies\n\n'The day I went to prison, I got my life back'\n\nWhat's your area like for young people?"

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nUS President Donald Trump was greeted with laughter in September when he told the UN that he had accomplished more than \"almost any administration\" in his country's history.\n\nMr Trump admitted that he \"didn't expect\" that reaction - but that it was \"just fine\".\n\nIt was one example of the many reasons people laugh - and most of them are not because somebody is being particularly funny.\n\nLaughter is primarily a form of bonding; we are 30 times more likely to laugh if we are with others than if we are alone.\n\nIt is an ancient, universal reaction that is not even limited to humans; it has been documented in many animal species, including apes and even rats.\n\nWhen rats play with each other or are tickled, they emit a distinct chirping sound which scientists have linked to laughter. It is used as a signal that they are only play-fighting rather than displaying aggression.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Apes also laugh, scientists say\n\nIf rats display this kind of behaviour, it is not too surprising that humans employ laughter in a complex and nuanced way.\n\nWe use laughter to make and maintain social bonds. It is an outward display that we understand each other, and also functions to exclude others who are outside our group.\n\nThis social and emotional control makes laughter incredibly powerful, so it is unsurprising to find that it is constantly exploited by people in both political and personal ways.\n\nWhy we laugh\n\nLaughter is a spontaneous non-verbal vocal expression, like a scream or a sob.\n\nThe noise we make when we laugh is very similar to the play grunts that apes make.\n\nUnlike speech, producing this sound involves almost no movement of the tongue, jaw or lips. It is closer to the sound that other mammals make than human speech.\n\nAlthough scientists still do not know exactly why we make this sound, it may be because it is one of the simplest way of making a sound with our voices - we are just squeezing air out in bursts.\n\nWhile our use of laughter develops over time, it is an inherent action; blind and deaf babies will laugh when they are tickled.\n\nThe political\n\nImage copyright Twitter\n\nComedians are given licence to earn our laughter, but there are many others who have used laughter, or tried to use it, to their own ends.\n\nRussian officials have been accused of using mockery to deflect blame and belittle challengers, most recently over the 2018 Novichok poisoning in Salisbury.\n\nBut humour does not have to be divisive to be powerful.\n\nUS President Bill Clinton famously changed an ill-tempered press statement by Russia's Boris Yeltsin into a hilarious event, simply by behaving as if Mr Yeltsin was being intentionally witty, and laughing helplessly.\n\nHowever, Mr Clinton took care to not look like he was laughing at him, to suggest they were both in on the joke.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin at the press conference\n\nOther public figures appear to carefully cultivate a \"funny\" image, where they often appear the butt of the joke.\n\nFor example, MP Boris Johnson was arguably first perceived as funny on satirical TV quiz show Have I Got News For You.\n\nMr Johnson kept up this light-hearted, funny persona over the following couple of decades, helping him to bat away critical comments with jokes and bluster.\n\nWhether it was getting stuck on a zip wire, or joking about never becoming prime minister, difficult questions could be disarmed, and his personal charm seemed enhanced, by the sounds of laughter.\n\nThe personal\n\nLaughter is also an important part of our everyday lives.\n\nFor example, I walked slap bang into another woman when I was crossing the road the other day.\n\nWe both laughed, but not because it was funny. We were laughing to show that we were both OK and not hurt or trying to hurt each other, or trying to steal one another's mobile phones.\n\nThis interaction was successful because it relies on us both understanding and using laughter in the same way.\n\nObservational studies indicate that most laughter actually stems from statements and comments, rather than jokes. The person who has just spoken laughs the most frequently, suggesting laughter is often not only a reaction to something someone else has said.\n\nThis type of \"bonding\" laughter is finessed over time through social interaction.\n\nOne of my lab's current studies indicates that our understanding of social laughter develops over our early adult life, and that it is not until we are in our 30s that we become fully adept at using it.\n\nIt is also dependent on a desire to find affiliation; research suggests that teenage boys at risk of psychopathy find laughter much less contagious than their peers.\n\nMore stories like this\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Boris Johnson became stuck on a zip wire in Victoria Park\n\nAnother key use of laughter is to help cope with stressful situations.\n\nCouples who discuss an area of disagreement in their relationship with positive expressions like laughter immediately become less stressed, research suggests.\n\nThey are also happier in their relationships and stay together for longer.\n\nHowever, this only works if both members of the couple share the joke.\n\nFor example, if one person is laughing and saying \"oh yes, I do buy too many books\" and the other person says, unsmilingly, \"it's a massive problem and I wish you would sort it out\", then no-one feels better.\n\nLaughter works, not because it is a kind of magic dust that makes people happier, but because it indicates you are comfortable enough to use it as a tool to negotiate a better mood, together.\n\nBecause the bottom line - for all almost all laughter - is that people laugh when they are with people they like, but also when they feel physically safe.\n\nWhen, where and who you laugh with is telling you something very important about your emotional world.\n\nLaughter can be a seriously important part of how we can help ourselves cope with difficult situations.\n\nAbout this piece\n\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.\n\nSophie Scott is a professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London.\n\nEdited by Eleanor Lawrie"

    "text": "Who is attacking Scotland\u2019s raptors? And what, exactly, happened to Fred?\n\nIt was late January when Fred disappeared. A young golden eagle, he would have had characteristic brown-gold feathers and of course that hooked bird-of-prey beak, bright lemon-coloured and black. Fred had been monitored near the Pentland Hills \u2013 not far from Edinburgh in Scotland.\n\nThe previous summer, Ruth Tingay, from conservation group Raptor Persecution UK, had watched as a colleague fitted a tag to the raptor at its nest site. She had been tracking Fred\u2019s movements ever since.\n\nThe trip to the Pentlands was the furthest he\u2019d been.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d only been gone from the nest site for three or four days,\u201d she says. It was on 20 January 2018 when the signal went blank.\n\nThen, unexpectedly, it returned four days later. But in a very strange place: about 10 miles out at sea near St Andrews. Quite far north-east from where Fred\u2019s signal had last been seen, did it reveal that Fred had been killed and dumped at sea?\n\nRaptors like golden eagles appear to be shot more often than they used to be (Credit: Javier Fern\u00e1ndez S\u00e1nchez/Getty)\n\nConservationists despaired. Another disappearing golden eagle that seemed to have met a suspicious end. Raptors are sometimes killed by humans, but the perpetrators are notoriously difficult to catch. Police Scotland are now investigating Fred\u2019s case.\n\nScotland is home to various raptor species, but golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) are perhaps the most iconic. While their population in Scotland is generally doing well, they struggle to survive in some areas, particularly in the south of the country. One project is hoping to change that by translocating birds there from the highlands.\n\nOther raptors are having an even tougher time \u2013 notably hen harriers, numbers of which are clearly declining. These birds, too, are sometimes killed illegally.\n\nBut who is attacking Scotland\u2019s raptors? And what, exactly, happened to Fred?\n\nMore signs of suspicious activity in Fred\u2019s case were revealed after Raptor Persecution UK got in touch with the manufacturer of his tag. It had been set up to record GPS coordinates for the bird and also connect to nearby mobile phone masts. Ordinarily that mobile network data wouldn\u2019t have been available to the conservationists, but the tag maker was able to provide access.\n\nSat-tagged hen harrier, Annie, found shot on a grouse moore, April 2015 (Credit: RSPB)\n\nThe results were startling \u2013 during that period of absence late in January, it looked as though Fred had travelled east seemingly along a road, south of Edinburgh, and then north over the Firth of Forth and out towards St Andrew\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt showed a pretty clear direction of travel up to the North Sea,\u201d says Tingay. The tag hasn\u2019t transmitted any data since those last data points were collected. And it isn\u2019t known whether it was still attached to Fred at the time of these mysterious movements, or whether it ultimately sank to the bottom of the sea. The trail, in other words, has gone cold.\n\n\u201cThere are so few breeding golden eagles in south Scotland so he was an important bird,\u201d says Tingay. \u201cTo lose him so soon after he left his natal [area]\u2026 is pretty shocking really.\u201d\n\nThe strange movements of Fred are \u201cabsolutely undoubtedly\u201d a result of human interference, says Ian Thomson at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll probably never know exactly how it happened,\u201d he adds. Thomson has been monitoring raptor killings in Scotland for years. He says there is a large weight of evidence linking the deaths to areas where grouse moors exist. There have been cases in which gamekeepers have killed raptors as a means of preventing them preying on grouse \u2013 which they need to retain in large numbers for the game shooting season.\n\nProsecutions are rare, though, and blame levelled at gamekeepers often proves controversial. According to a spokesman for the Scottish Gamekeepers Association, the body has suspended six members over five years for wildlife crime offences.\n\n\u201cAs an organisation, we advocate only legal means to resolve species conflicts,\u201d he adds. Part of the problem for anyone monitoring raptor deaths is that whoever is killing birds of prey seems to have become more determined to cover their tracks in recent years, explains Thomson.\n\nWho is attacking Scotland\u2019s raptors? (Credit: RSPB)\n\nFor example, he says the RSPB has evidence to suggest that raptors like golden eagles appear to be shot more often than they used to be \u2013 perhaps so the perpetrators can easily remove the carcass so less evidence is available to investigators.\n\n\u201cIn the last six or seven years there does appear to have been a significant move away from the illegal use of poisons,\u201d adds Thomson.\n\nLogan Steele, of the Scottish Raptors Study Group, agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re finding a lot of birds with satellite tags disappearing, no bodies found,\u201d he says.\n\nThe group has tagged in excess of 150 birds in recent years, he adds. He\u2019s currently monitoring data from a hen harrier that has just started to move about the country more widely. \u201cI\u2019m hoping it will survive,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile there are those who would harm Scotland\u2019s magnificent birds of prey, there are plenty of others working to protect these creatures wherever they can. Sadly, their work is still cut out for them, says Tingay: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know whether it\u2019s improving or not but I certainly haven\u2019t seen any evidence of a decline in persecution.\u201d\n\nBy Chris Baraniuk\n\nFeatured image by BarbAnna/Getty"

    "authors": [
      "Laura Studarus"
    ],
    "text": "I met my now best friend Hanna a few years ago during my first visit to Helsinki, on a coffee date set up out of desperation. Without any acquaintances in the city, I just wanted someone to sit next to in public, and given our tenuous work connection, she fitted the bill. Our drink quickly turned into dinner, wrapping up four hours later after doing deep dives on politics, religion, sex and life, the kind of topics that usually take friends years to address. A year later, I flew back to be a bridesmaid at her wedding, still shocked at how fast we forged a connection.\n\n\u201cLaura,\u201d she told me matter-of-factly when I asked why we had bonded so quickly.\n\nWhat she neglected to tell me, however, is that Finns think if there\u2019s no important topic to discuss, there\u2019s no conversation at all. In fact, one of their national sayings is \u2018Silence is gold, talking is silver\u2019.\n\nSmall talk outside social situations between close friends is virtually non-existent. Interactions with baristas? Limited to the name of the coffee you want to order. Sitting, walking or standing in a way that requires acknowledging a stranger\u2019s presence? Never. (A meme featuring people standing outside a bus shelter rather than under it is an often-posted joke in Finland to illustrate this point.) If you\u2019re a foreigner, congratulations \u2013 you\u2019re probably the loudest person on their often (voluntarily) silent public transport.\n\nWith two million saunas in the country, which are enjoyed fully nude (generally gender-segregated, although that rule tends to be thrown out in the company of friends), the Finnish seem to have no problem with getting up close and personal. But when clothes are on, the bets are off.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 Europe\u2019s nation of introverts\n\n\u2022 Where Dutch directness comes from\n\n\u2022 What the Indian head wobble really says\n\nFinnish people often forgo the conversational niceties that are hard-baked into other cultures, and typically don\u2019t see the need to meet foreign colleagues, tourists and friends in the middle. As Tiina Latvala, a former English instructor in Sodankyl\u00e4, Lapland, explained, part of her job was to introduce her young students to the concept of small talk.\n\n\u201cWe had a practice where you had to pretend to meet someone for the first time,\u201d Latvala said. \u201cYou had to pretend you were meeting at the cafe or on a bus and [that] you didn\u2019t know each other and do a bit of chit chat. We had written on the whiteboard all the safe topics so they didn\u2019t have to struggle with coming up with something to talk about. We brainstormed. They usually found it really difficult.\u201d\n\nAlina Jefremoff, an 18-year-old Finnish student in Helsinki, recalls similarly formatted exercises with an air of incredulity. Thanks to television and films (which are mostly broadcast in English) she was already acquainted with non-Finnish communication styles. Even still, she had to endure a series of connect-the-dot-style homework assignments.\n\n\u201c[They\u2019re] about basic conversation,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe answers are already there. We are taught to answer \u2018I\u2019m great, how about you?\u2019; \u2018How is your mum?\u2019. It was very clear how to be in a conversation, as if we didn\u2019t already know. It was very weird\u2026 as if there were right answers to the questions.\u201d\n\nWhen asked for an example of how she wishes Finnish society were more open, Jefremoff gave the example of doing something ridiculous, like dropping her books in the metro, and then laughing at herself. She says she wishes that strangers would join her in acknowledging the silliness of the situation by laughing or commenting. Initiating social contact with people you don\u2019t know? Not something they\u2019ve been taught.\n\nThere are more hypotheses than answers for why Finnish culture has a veil of silence permanently stitched in place. Latvala believes their trademark directness has something to do with the complexity of the Finnish language and the fairly large distance between cities (Latvala\u2019s reasoning: If you\u2019ve travelled any distance to see someone, why waste time?).\n\nHowever, Prof Laura Kolbe, who teaches European history at the University of Helsinki, sees the topic through a comparative lens. The Finns, she says, don\u2019t see their quietness or lack of small talk as a negative. Instead, every culture judges another on their social norms, hence the widespread stereotype of the silent Finn among more emotive nationalities.\n\n\u201cThe idea of silence has been especially prevalent when Finns were seen from the eyes of close neighbours,\u201d she explained. \u201cFor example, when Swedish- and German-speaking people came to Finland in the past, they saw Finns as silent citizens, wondering why the people didn\u2019t speak any Swedish or German and rather remained silent among their guests.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t for lack of skill, for Finland has two national languages \u2013 Finnish and Swedish \u2013 and Finns begin English lessons when they\u2019re six or seven. But rather it\u2019s because when faced with expressing themselves in second (or third) language, many often choose to not say anything rather than risk not being fully understood. However, when among their own, silence functions as an extension of comfortable conversation.\n\nIt\u2019s an idea that\u2019s backed up by Dr Anna Vatanen, a researcher at the University of Oulu, whose forthcoming study \u2018Lapses in interaction and the stereotype of the Silent Finn\u2019 demonstrates that at least among their own, Finns do communicate through comfortable silence \u2013 particularly among familiars. When it comes to outsiders judging the stereotypically straightforward Finn, she warns that some nuances do get lost in translation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the structure or features of the language, but rather the ways in which people use the language to do things,\u201d she explained via email. \u201cFor instance, the \u2018how are you?\u2019 question that is most often placed in the very beginning of an encounter. In English-speaking countries, it is mostly used just as a greeting and no serious answer is expected to it. On the contrary, the Finnish counterpart (Mit\u00e4 kuuluu?) can expect a \u2018real\u2019 answer after it: quite often the person responding to the question starts to tell how his or her life really is at the moment, what\u2019s new, how they have been doing.\u201d\n\nBut when Finns do opt out of casual conversation, says Karoliina Korhonen, author of Finnish Nightmares, a book and online comic series where an \u2018average\u2019 Finn deals with life\u2019s most benign terrors, it also has something to do with respect. Why risk making someone else feel uncomfortable?\n\n\u201cI like to think Finnish people value personal space,\u201d she notes. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know another person, you don\u2019t want to bother them. They might be having their own time or they don\u2019t want a stranger to come bother them. If you see they\u2019re open and you both are open, you can have something. But most of the time people are polite and keep their distance.\u201d\n\nBut their desire for avoidance is a predisposition so common that it\u2019s become hard-baked into Finnish culture. Formula One driver Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen has built his iconic image around his lack of talking. Comics use the Finn\u2019s lack of small talk as part of their routine. It\u2019s even gone international: thanks to the unexpected spike in popularity of Korhonen\u2019s work in China, teens there who don\u2019t enjoy social interactions are describing themselves as \u2018spiritually Finnish\u2019.\n\nIn some cases, though, Finnish society seems to be trending toward a marginally more open existence. However, it\u2019s happening slowly. For Jussi Salonen, COO of Finnish chocolate company Goodio, living in Los Angeles for two years made him wish he could import a bit more of the US\u2019 open spirit to his home country.\n\n\u201cWhen I was [back] in Finland, I was almost offended when I went to get a cup of coffee from a coffee shop and they didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt was just \u2018what do you want?\u2019. How can you say that? Are you not going to ask anything before that? Oh, yeah. This is my home country. This is just the way things are. It was funny to notice how things got twisted a little bit when I was living over there\u2026 I think a little bit of communication or small talk doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a hopeful idea that Finns can meet the rest of the world in the middle while respecting each other\u2019s privacy. But for now, it leaves Finland with one of the most interesting social dichotomies. Sure, you might not speak to people on the street. But if you\u2019re lucky, sometimes a stranger will instantly become a friend and tell you everything.\n\nCORRECTION: This story originally had offensive language, which has now been removed.\n\nWhy We Are What We Are is a BBC Travel series examining the characteristics of a country and investigating whether they are true.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

He invented the computer \u2013 and stops you getting spammed\n\nTuring\u2019s mathematical genius allowed him to foresee the possibility and function of computer like machines before the existence of the necessary technology. Laying out the theory for such devices in an essay in 1936, his revolutionary work provided the foundation for modern computers. He later came-up with the \u2018Turing test\u2019 to determine whether a machine is intelligent \u2013 or not.

The arrest also lost him his security clearance and two years later Turing died of cyanide poisoning \u2013 whether it was suicide or not is still debated. A campaign to grant him a pardon, fittingly started by e-petition, resulted in him being granted one posthumously in 2013.

    "text": "(This article is illustrated with a series of portraits by photographer Maika Elan.)\n\nIn today\u2019s connected world it can feel difficult to disengage. An endless stream of emails, posts, tweets, likes, comments and pictures keeps us constantly plugged into modern life.\n\nBut in Japan half a million people live as modern-day hermits. They are known as hikikomori \u2013 recluses who withdraw from all social contact and often don\u2019t leave their houses for years at a time. A government survey found roughly 541,000 (1.57% of the population) but many experts believe the total is much higher as it can take years before they seek help.\n\nThe condition was initially thought to be unique to Japan, but in recent years cases have appeared across the world. In neighbouring South Korea, a 2005 analysis estimated there were 33,000 socially withdrawn adolescents (0.3% of the population) and in Hong Kong a 2014 survey pegged the figure at 1.9%. It\u2019s not just in Asia, cases are appearing in the US, Spain, Italy, France and elsewhere.\n\nWhether due to increased awareness or a growing problem remains unclear, but concern around social isolation is on the rise globally. Last January the UK appointed its first minister for loneliness and recent Office of National Statistics data found nearly 10% of 16 to 24-year-olds reported feeling \"always or often\" lonely.\n\nIf you like this, you may also enjoy:\n\nA controversial but common theme in hikikomori research is the isolating influence of modern technology. Any potential links are far from settled, but there\u2019s concern Japan\u2019s lost generation could be a canary in the coal mine for our increasingly disconnected societies. At the same time there\u2019s hope technology could help bring people back from the brink.\n\nThe term hikikomori, often used interchangeably for the condition and its sufferers, was coined by Japanese psychologist Tamaki Sait\u014d in his 1998 book Social Withdrawal \u2013 Adolescence Without End. Today the most common criteria is a combination of physical isolation, social avoidance and psychological distress that lasts six months or longer.\n\nThe condition was originally considered \u201cculture-bound\u201d and there are reasons to think Japanese society is particularly vulnerable, says Takahiro Kato, an associate professor of psychiatry at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, who both studies and treats hikikomori.\n\n\u201cIn Japanese there\u2019s a very famous saying, \u2018A protruding nail will be hammered down\u2019,\u201d says Kato. Only half-jokingly, the 6ft 2in doctor adds that\u2019s why he walks around with a slight hunch so he\u2019s not seen as arrogant. Rigid social norms, high expectations from parents and a culture of shame make Japanese society a fertile breeding ground for feelings of inadequacy and a desire to keep one\u2019s head below the parapet, Kato says.\n\nAfter quitting his job in 2015, Tomoki, 29, tells me he was determined to get back into work and regularly visited the job centre. He also attended a religious group almost daily, but the group\u2019s leader started publicly criticising his attitude and inability to get back into work. When he stopped attending the leader called him several times a week and the pressure, combined with that from his family, eventually caused him to withdraw completely. (The names of all hikikomori have been changed to protect their identity.)\n\n\u201cI blamed myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn't want to see anyone, I didn't want to go outside.\u201d\n\nSchool is a monoculture, everyone has to have the same opinion. If someone says something they're out of the group - Ichika\n\nAt Fukuoka city\u2019s hikikomori support centre the Yokayoka Room \u2013 \u201ctake it easy\u201d room in the local dialect \u2013 one by one the group describes the pressure they felt to conform. \u201cSchool is a monoculture, everyone has to have the same opinion,\u201d says one of the visitors, Haru, 34. \u201cIf someone says something they're out of the group.\u201d\n\nLiving up to the expectations of Japanese society has also got harder. Economic stagnation and globalisation is bringing Japan\u2019s collectivist and hierarchical traditions into conflict with a more individualistic and competitive Western worldview, says Kato. And while British parents might give short shrift to a child refusing to leave their room, Japanese parents feel a strong obligation to support children no matter what and shame often prevents them from seeking help, says Kato.\n\nBut the increasing number of cases outside Japan is leading people to question the culture-bound nature of the condition. In a 2015 study, Kato and collaborators in the US, South Korea and India found cases matching the clinical criteria in all four countries.\n\nLead author Alan Teo, an associate professor of psychiatry at Oregon Health and Science University in the US, says he is regularly contacted by Americans self-identifying with the condition.\n\n\u201cPeople have this underlying assumption it must be most common in Japan,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you formally measured how common it is we might come up with some surprising information.\u201d\n\nSpanish psychiatrist Angeles Malagon-Amor, at Hospital del Mar in Barcelona, stumbled across the problem during a home treatment program in Barcelona. Malagon-Amor and colleagues frequently found patients with extended periods of social withdrawal, which led her to the literature on Japan\u2019s hikikomori. Between 2008 and 2014 they came across 190 cases \u2013 the most recent data they hold \u2013 but that was before the program was expanded and she\u2019s sure it\u2019s the tip of the iceberg.\n\n\u201cAt the time, we were two psychiatrists and two nurses for a population of more than one million,\u201d she says. \u201cI think there must be a lot more cases.\u201d\n\nEstablishing a broader explanation is fraught with difficulties though. Multiple studies have found that hikikomori typically have co-occurring psychiatric or developmental disorders, which can vary in type and severity. Triggers can also be diverse from work stress to dysfunctional family dynamics.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons hikikomori is fascinating is that there's not one explanation,\u201d says Teo. \u201cIt's a lot of factors coming together.\u201d\n\nOne factor regularly discussed is the role of technology like the Internet, social media and videogames \u2013 already the source of contentious debate in mental health research. Many hikikomori I spoke to were prolific internet and videogame users and multiple studies have noted high levels of technology use, but it\u2019s far from universal and the nature of the relationship is still unclear.\n\nIn South Korea, anyone who remains isolated for at least three months is termed \u201coiettolie\u201d, the link is more established. A 2013 study of 43 oiettolie found that nearly one in ten were already considered to be addicted to the internet, and more than 50% were thought to be at high-risk of internet addiction.\n\nTaeYoung Choi, a psychiatrist and researcher at the Catholic University of Daegu who worked on the study, doesn\u2019t think technology necessarily causes withdrawal, but he thinks it can support and deepen it. \u201cSome people can get more isolated by using technology, which makes that isolation more rigid and more severe,\u201d he says.\n\nIn a 2018 study of hikikomori cases In Barcelona, Malagon-Amor said they found only 30% exhibited internet addiction. But they found that group tended to be younger \u2013 the average age across all 190 cases was 39 but it was just 24 for those addicted to the internet.\n\n\u201cFor what we've seen now, it\u2019s not that big an issue,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think this is going to be much bigger in the next few years in those cases of social isolation in young people with Internet addiction.\u201d\n\nThe effect of technology could also be more subtle, says Kato. Computer games have rewritten the nature of play, he says, with children spending ever more time in controlled virtual environments rather than the unpredictable real world. At the same time the internet, smartphones and social media have made indirect rather than face-to-face contact much more common.\n\n\u201cNow society has no risk, no direct communication,\u201d says Kato. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to hit the reset button and reverse and there's low experience of failure.\u201d He thinks that\u2019s detrimental to children\u2019s development, making them less resilient and less adept at interpersonal relationships. Just like you need to be exposed to dirt to develop immunity to diseases you need to be exposed to risk and failure to develop resilience and independence, he adds.\n\nAt the Yokayoka Room patients said they say they feel more able to speak freely on the Internet. When I ask why they say it\u2019s the anonymity it provides. Ichika, 27, adds that he likes the ability to always interact on his own terms.\n\nThere is some recognition of the limitations of this kind of communication. Hinata, 32, worries about the superficial nature of online dialogue and the ease with which you can avoid conflict. \u201cWe always try to make friends with the people who have the same opinion where we can feel more comfortable to comment,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cTechnology itself can\u2019t be 100% behind the aggravation of hikikomori as a world phenomenon,\u201d says Choi. But he thinks our increasing ability to shop, play and socialise without real-world interactions could be exacerbating social isolation.\n\nFace-to-face contact, either in person or on video-chat, corresponds to lower risk of depression, compared with contact by phone, email and social media\n\nThere\u2019s simply not enough research to draw any conclusive links yet, says Teo. But he says it does chime with his gut feeling, which is based partly on research outside the hikikomori field. In multiple studies his lab has found face-to-face contact either in person or on video-chat corresponds to lower risk of depression, compared with contact by phone, email and social media.\n\n\u201cIf interactions online become a substitute for face-to-face interactions, I think the research that I've done and other folks have done indicate that that's problematic,\u201d he says.\n\nLines of communication\n\nIt\u2019s important not to demonise technology though, says Teo. Social media or email are not the underlying causes of mental health problems, they are vehicles for communication that can be used both positively and negatively.\n\nIn particular, the internet provides a window into the isolated lives of hikikomori. Last year Teo and researchers in China used social media apps like WeChat and Weibo to survey socially withdrawn teenagers. It cost just $7.27 (\u00a35.53) per participant to reach 137 people, one-fifth of whom were experiencing some level of social withdrawal, suggesting it could be a cost-effective method for reaching hidden cases.\n\nThe growing interconnectedness of online and offline worlds could also offer ways to ease hikikomori back into everyday life. In 2016 Kato published a case report on a patient who suddenly started going out daily after downloading Nintendo\u2019s hit smartphone game Pokemon Go.\n\nThe game uses augmented reality to overlay digital creatures onto the real-world that players have to roam about collecting. Kato thinks this kind of bridge between real and virtual worlds could help encourage hikikomori out of their homes and even make it easier for health workers to make first contact, particularly if it can be tailored to their needs. For example, says Kato, this kind of game could be tweaked so valuable items appear at hikikomori support centres.\n\nHe\u2019s also started working with a Japanese company to create a robot that could reintroduce hikikomori to social contact in a controllable way. Researchers in Hong Kong have successfully used dogs for a similar purpose, which he thinks could serve as a template. \"But Japanese like robots!\" he adds.\n\nThere may also be less hi-tech ways to exploit hikikomori\u2019s relationship with technology. Shinichiro Matsuguma, a PhD student at Keio University School of Medicine in Tokyo who specializes in positive psychology, has set up a non-profit to rehabilitate hikikomori called the Strength Association. He\u2019s provided coaching to 32 patients using principles from positive psychology, which focuses on strengths rather than flaws. The majority of his clients play videogames so this typically involves discussing playing styles and motivations to identify strengths like teamwork, strategy or leadership.\n\n\"Many people, even their parents, see hikikomori as not doing anything,\u201d he says. \"But from my perspective, they're developing their strengths through the video games. And I always tell them while you're playing video games you are developing strengths that can be applicable to different life domains.\"\n\nEstablishing these strengths improves self-esteem, he says, but can also guide patients on the best path to re-entering society. The approach has yet to be scientifically evaluated, but he says almost 80% have taken a first step towards reintegration like going back to school, university or vocational training.\n\nRemote counselling\n\nExperts agree though that there's no substitute for direct social contact and intensive therapy. Yoko Honda, a clinical psychiatrist who manages the Fukuoka City Mental Health and Welfare Centre, says the national government has been pushing them to use social media to provide remote counselling to hikikomori, but they\u2019ve resisted.\n\n\u201cJust one tweet is not enough for expressing our anxiety or emotions,\u201d she says, though she agrees it might be useful for reaching new patients.\n\nAsides from psychotherapy and medication to treat any underlying psychiatric disorders, a central plank of their strategy is family training to fix dysfunctional home environments. The Yokayoka Room also provides a safe haven for those on the path to recovery to meet others like them and relearn atrophied social skills. But she says the varied nature of cases makes treating them tough.\n\n\u201cWe hope to give tailormade support to all these hikikomori,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we always need a lot of labour, a lot of time.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s something Malagon-Amor found in her 12-month study of Barcelona\u2019s hikikomori. Those who received more intensive therapy either at home or in hospital reacted best. Less intensive outpatient services were linked to higher abandonment of treatment and often worsening isolation. \u201cThey're very fragile patients,\u201d she says.\n\nWhether or not the West should be gearing up for a tsunami of such patients is still unclear. But social isolation can be a feature of other conditions, from depression to PTSD, so Malagon-Amor thinks the West can learn a lot from the Japanese experience.\n\nAnd regardless of the scale of the phenomenon, Teo hopes hikikomori research will broaden our understanding of the importance of social connections to our mental and physical health.\n\n\u201cWhen I talk to parents of someone with hikikomori it's very clear to me that the social isolation is causing huge negative impacts \u2013 it ripples through the individual, to their family, to others,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cSo that social impairment, problems with social connections, we haven't paid enough attention to that in medicine. And I think now with hikikomori, with more attention to loneliness we are finally starting to look at these issues as health issues. And that's good.\u201d\n\n--\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

Thinking about the way my grandparents were, and the traditional way of Japanese life, I thought we could stop and look around and accept the things that we don\u2019t normally appreciate, like getting older.\u201d\n\nCalmness seeps through many of the phrases, whether it\u2019s derived from accepting elements beyond our control or being respectful in all our encounters. South African artist David Buchler \u2013 who has written short essays for the book \u2013 has lived in Japan for seven years. \u201cWhen I speak to people in Japanese, I\u2019m very aware of what I\u2019m saying and my gestures and being polite, thinking about how my words would affect them,\u201d he tells BBC Culture. \u201cIt\u2019s a very different approach to talking.\u201d\n\nThe book covers vast topics including \u2018harmony\u2019, \u2018gratitude\u2019 and \u2018time\u2019 \u2013 but it isn\u2019t an abstract dictionary. Instead, Fujimoto offers a way into a culture that can often seem remote to foreigners. So, for Shibui, which \u201crecalls the beauty revealed by the passage of time\u201d, she writes: \u201cInhering in an aesthetic of calm \u2013 colours subdued and brightness muted \u2013 this word reminds us to appreciate the things that improve with age. There is a grace in maturity, and the experiences of life mark their objects with a pleasant richness. You might experience shibui in the colour of leaves in early winter, or an old teacup on a table.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a philosophy finding a receptive audience: by teaching us to find joy in the objects we own, Japanese tidying guru Marie Kondo has become a Netflix hit and a lifestyle brand, having a knock-on effect on charity shops; while the 21st-Century mindfulness movement offers bite-sized meditations to practise when we\u2019re on our way to work, cooking our dinner, or wandering around a supermarket.\n\n\u201cLearning the language calmed me a lot \u2013 the way I approach things is more beneficial to myself,\u201d says Buchler. He picks out the phrase \u2018mono-no aware\u2019, or \u2018the ephemeral nature of beauty\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s basically about being both saddened and appreciative of transience \u2013 and also about the relationship between life and death. In Japan, there are four very distinct seasons, and you really become aware of life and mortality and transience. You become aware of how significant those moments are.\u201d\n\nThe book reinforces how much a country\u2019s climatecan affect its vocabulary. \u201cJapan is a small country, the actual habitable area on the island is very limited, and it\u2019s surrounded by the ocean,\u201d says Fujimoto. \u201cThe condition of living in pre-modern Japan was harsh\u2026 people had to learn how to live with that \u2013 you can\u2019t always be bitter about what nature might bring. Rather than being upset or trying to resist, they figured out the wise way to appreciate and deal with the things that they have.\u201d\n\n\u201cI recall typhoons destroying the crops and a massive earthquake stole thousands of lives in my prefecture,\u201d writes Fujimoto in her introduction. \u201cThat is how the Japanese developed their way of life: living in harmony with nature, a philosophy that sits at the heart of Shinto, the ancient indigenous spirituality of the Japanese people\u2026 This belief system developed into a uniquely Japanese way of appreciating beauty today.\u201d\n\nFujimoto acknowledges that there are certain \u201cessential elements of beauty, such as symmetry, composition, youth and liveliness\u201d \u2013 but, she argues, \u201cWe tend to be attracted to those \u2018positive\u2019 qualities, whereas opposing qualities, such as ugliness, imperfection, age and death, are considered distasteful in the Western world. The traditional Japanese aesthetic is, conversely, founded on the undeniable truth of nature; everything in nature is transient; nothing lasts, and nothing is perfect. There is a beauty in all the varied spectra of life, from birth to death, imperfection to perfection, ugliness to elegance.\u201d\n\nThe book reinforces the benefit that understanding words particular to different languages can bring: we can see the world in two different ways, holding both viewpoints simultaneously. \u201cIf you just switch a gear you can see more beauty in the world,\u201d says Fujimoto. \u201cJust a little change of mind or perspective: we have so many great things around that we don\u2019t notice or appreciate.\u201d\n\nIkigai and Other Japanese Words to Live by (published by Modern Books) is out now.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "text": "Poachers and criminal networks continue to drive endangered species towards extinction \u2013 but with the help of groundbreaking tech, authorities are fighting back.\n\nIn a time when climate change is melting the Arctic and setting California on fire, rainforests continue to be razed in Indonesia and Brazil, and plastic pollution chokes the oceans, it can still come as a shock that illegal hunting of wild animals for profit is still one of the biggest drivers of extinction. Demand for ornaments such as elephant ivory carvings, fabled tonics such as tiger bone wine, traditional medicines such as ground rhino horn for rheumatism, and exotic household pets such as cheetahs, continue to consign some of the most charismatic animals on earth to a grisly fate.\n\nA kilogram of rhinoceros horn can fetch as much as \u00a350,000, driven by rising demand from China \u00a9 Wynnter/Getty\n\n\u201cThere is still an enormous market for chimpanzee body parts in Africa \u2013 for example in Nigeria a chimpanzee head will sell for $100 in a market,\u201d says Dr Liz Greengrass, head of conservation for environmental NGO Born Free. \u201cWe know that it\u2019s the fetish market, and not demand for meat, that is driving the hunting of chimpanzees in some parts of West Africa \u2013 there is still a taboo against eating chimp meat in much of the region, but people who can afford to spend money on \u2018fetishes\u2019 will still do so, for use in \u2018juju\u2019 or traditional medicine.\u201d\n\nCriminal networks make big money from poaching\n\nArcane as it might seem, there is one simple reason for the continued trade in wildlife products, says lawyer Shruti Suresh, campaigner with the Environmental Investigation Agency: enormous profits. \u201cOnce you have profit associated with any product \u2013 and we are talking about very high profits \u2013 that will inevitably attract criminality: a toxic blend of organized crime and systemic corruption,\u201d she says.\n\nWhen a kilogram of rhinoceros horn can fetch as much as \u00a350,000, driven by rising demand from China, it\u2019s no surprise that organized crime networks get into the game. Where contraband items reap huge prices, syndicates follow. The rise in rhino poaching over the past decade has been alarming: Between 2007 and 2014, rhino poaching in South Africa increased by a staggering 7,000%, from just 13 animals in 2007 to 1,215 in 2014. That has declined just slightly, to 1,028 rhinos shot in 2017, but the damage has been done: the last male northern white rhino died earlier this year, making the species functionally extinct.\n\nOf the five remaining species, there are still roughly 20,000 white rhinos in Africa and roughly 5,000 black rhinos, but as long as there is demand for horn in China, poachers will persist in pursuing them. Even zoos seem incapable of keeping rhinos safe: last year in a Paris zoo a male white rhino was shot by armed intruders, who shot it three times in the head and hacked off its horn with a chainsaw \u2013 despite the presence of security.\n\nJust this month, investigators revealed a tiger farm in the Czech Republic linked to Vietnamese criminal networks supplying wealthy Chinese consumers with bones for wine and glue. With price tags of \u00a350 a gram for tiger bone, \u00a390 a claw and \u00a33,500 for a pelt, it\u2019s should come as little surprise that illegal tiger farms exist. But what is truly shocking is their scale: it\u2019s estimated that farms in China, Laos, Vietnam and Thailand hold up to 8,000 captive tigers \u2013 dwarfing the 3,500 estimated to be left in the wild. These farms perhaps counter-intuitively do not discourage hunting of wild tigers: they increase demand by normalizing the trade in tiger parts, and what\u2019s more, it\u2019s cheaper to kill a wild tiger than rear one in captivity. What\u2019s more, we\u2019re now seeing jaguars and lions being poached from South America and Africa to fuel Chinese demand for bones of big cats.\n\nChina to lift ban on tiger bone and rhino horn\n\nAnd if this didn\u2019t already make for grim reading, just in October 2018 the Chinese government shocked the world by announcing it would lift the ban on the use of tiger bone and rhino horn products in traditional medicine. \u201cThese enormous tiger farms have been around since the 1980s - the government has succumbed to industry pressure by lifting the ban, and in so doing has rung a death knell for tigers and rhinos,\u201d says Suresh. \u201cThis will only drive poaching \u2013 we know that tigers will be poached in India, the world\u2019s largest tiger state, and trafficked through Nepal before being sold in China.\u201d\n\nAnd if 1,200 rhinos poached in a year, or 8,000 captive tigers in farms raised for slaughter sound like enormous numbers, consider that an estimated 50,000 elephants are poached every year for their ivory, according to the Center for Conservation Biology.\n\nWhen it comes to protecting animals from poachers in the first place, figuring out where illegal hunting is taking place, or identifying the source of an animal product, conservationists face many challenges. But developments in technology are putting new tools into the hands of the law enforcement officials and conservation biologists who so desperately need them, using artificial intelligence, machine learning, unmanned aerial vehicles (or drones) and more.\n\nHow science is fighting poachers\n\nOne difficulty faced when illegal bones, horns and skin are seized is knowing where they came from \u2013 such as a protected area in another country. Fortunately there are ways that artificial intelligence can help: every tiger has a unique stripe pattern for example, like a fingerprint. Using camera traps throughout protected ranges, India has created the world\u2019s database of images, which has been successfully used to determine that a seized tiger pelt came from a protected area and thus had been poached, not farmed. \u201cThis is hugely valuable for enforcement,\u201d says Suresh, noting that in 2016 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) adopted a proposal calling on all member states to share their images of tiger skins to create an even larger database.\n\nDNA analysis can help track where animal parts are being trafficked from \u00a9 Andrew Brookes/Getty\n\nWhen animal products cannot be identified by appearance alone, DNA analysis can pinpoint the source, and since 2013 CITES has called for any seizure of ivory larger than half a tonne to be sent for DNA analysis. In 2015 biologists from the University of Washington, working with investigators from Interpol, showed in 2015 that a seized batch of ivory had come from two areas in Tanzania, allowing for pressure to be put on the African nation to clamp down on elephant poaching, which had led to the number of elephants in that country dropping by 60 per cent between 2009 and 2014.\n\nSynthetics\n\nTaking a different approach is materials scientist Professor Fritz Vollrath of the University of Oxford, who spent decades studying the properties of spider silk and other biological materials before turning his attention to ivory: working with researchers in China to develop a synthetic mimic of natural ivory. \u201cIvory is a nice material that people like to handle \u2013 but does it have to come from a dead elephant? What if we can create a mixture of collagen and minerals that has the same qualities?\u201d he says. \u201cWhen we started this project, it was to disarm the carvers lobby in China, who were arguing that they had been carving for 6,000 years and the west was trying to rob them of their traditions. We argued back that we could give them a synthetic material with the same properties, and give it to them in much bigger blocks which they could do so much more with.\u201d\n\nIn a similar vein, startup Pembient is trying to produce a synthetic form of rhino horn. They\u2019ve created a few prototypes, and expect to have a pilot run of 1 kg cylinders (roughly 9.93 cm dia. x 9.93 cm tall) at $2.61 per gram ready for sale in 2022 says Matthew Markus of Pembient.\n\nCamera traps\n\nIt will take time for synthetic substitutes to catch on, and wildlife protection officials continue to struggle to monitor enormous national parks. To help them, astrophysicist Claire Burke of Liverpool John Moores University in the UK is applying her expertise from studying the stars to track wildlife in the bush with thermal cameras that pick up infrared heat.\n\nDrones are on the frontline in the battle against poachers \u00a9 Claire Burke\n\n\u201cEcologists told us they were having a hard time coping with all the data from the drones they were using to keep track of their huge territories,\u201d she says. \u201cWell, we\u2019ve been using various tools to look at huge amounts of data like this for decades \u2013 just like stars, animals are just bright, shiny objects in a dark background.\u201d\n\nCombining her astrophysical training with conservation biology \u2013 a field she dubs \u201castro ecology\u201d \u2013 Burke is using machine learning to improve the accuracy with which cameras can correctly identify wildlife. The best tool to inform the algorithms isn\u2019t technological, however, but human, a \u201ccitizen science\u201d project run through Zooniverse that calls on volunteers to identify images of the animals to feed the cameras.\n\nUsing an algorithm, this camera can identify humans and different species in thermal images \u00a9 LJMU/Chester Zoo\n\n\u201cEvery different species of animal has a unique thermal profile, like a fingerprint. But we need lots of thermal images of the animals in order to learn their thermal profiles \u2013 the cameras can\u2019t learn it from just one detection,\u201d she says. \u201cBut people are very good at seeing these kinds of patterns. Anyone can volunteer to identify the different animals for us, which we can use to train a computer based on their classifications \u2013 after a while the computer can learn on its own and we don\u2019t need people anymore.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day however, images are just images \u2013 what conservationists really need to be able to dismantle traps, catch poachers in the act, and effectively monitor territories to prevent poachers from getting near animals in the first place.\n\nWildlife security\n\nThe solution that Founding Co-director of the University of Southern California Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society [CAIS] Professor Milind Tambe came up with is to apply the tools he developed in his work as an artificial intelligence researcher in security applying game theory. \u201cThe goals are different, but there is a lot of overlap in the two fields,\u201d he says.\n\nThe system he developed to catch poachers, called PAWS (for Protection Assistant for Wildlife Security), grew out of a collaboration with the Uganda Wildlife Authority in 2013, who gave to CAIS 14 years worth of data on poaching activities in Queen Elizabeth National Park, featuring more than 125,000 observations on animal remains, traps and snares and more \u2013 all with GPS coordinates. Tambe and his team of students were able to create a system that would predict likely hotspots for poaching and direct patrols there to remove traps before they can kill any animals, plus generate new patrol routes to areas that were infrequently monitored.\n\n\u201cShowing results in the lab is not satisfying for anyone \u2013 we needed to be able to test our system in Uganda to show it could work,\u201d he says. \u201cSure enough, when we asked patrols to monitor areas for a month where the data predicted they could find snares but where they hadn\u2019t thought of going, indeed they did find snares and a poached elephant.\u201d\n\nContinuing to refine the program, Tambe is now partnering with SMART \u2013 a consortium of wildlife agencies \u2013 to integrate PAWS into their software. \u201cMy job is to support conservationists, and to see what I can do for them,\u201d says Tambe.\n\n\u201cIn many protected areas in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, the protection authorities have to be incredibly resourceful \u2013 the funding they receive to monitor huge provinces is the equivalent of what is given to monitor Hyde Park,\u201d says Jonathan Palmer, Executive Director of Strategic Technology at the Wildlife Conservation Society, which is using PAWS to support SMART. \u201cThe odds are stacked against them. It\u2019s a tough job, and it\u2019s not rewarded well. Working with Milind\u2019s team, we could figure out how we could use that data with some predictive intelligence that could tell us with some measure of certainty where poaching was likely to occur. From what we see, it provides a powerful tool to suggest where patrols need to go.\u201d\n\nFor Tambe, PAWS is just the start.\u201cI find it so interesting, and inspiring, that people who could have led a very comfortable life doing anything else are risking their lives, going off into some forest, and willing to spend the rest of their lives trying to protect wildlife from disappearing,\u201d says Tambe.\n\nBy Zoe Cormier\n\nFeatured image by Lost Horizon Images/Getty"

    "text": "Image copyright Facebook Image caption What if your daily commute meant swimming through mangroves?\n\nImagine if going to school meant swimming and wading through water and mangroves, your school books tied up in a plastic bag over your head.\n\nAll the while, you're struggling to keep your face above water and fighting against the current.\n\nFor some children in the Philippines, this is a daily routine - but a charity is trying to make it easier for them to get their education by providing communities with boats.\n\nThe Yellow Boat of Hope Foundation started out as a small idea on social media yet over the years has become a countrywide charity helping school children in need.\n\nThe first community where the charity got involved was one of fishermen and seaweed farmers living in stilted houses in the sea off the coast of Zamboanga City, a poor region of Mindanao in the south.\n\nImage copyright Yellow Boat of Hope Foundation Image caption Many communities don't have spare boats for the children\n\nThe children had to wade as far as one kilometre through water just to get to school. If the tide was high, the wading became swimming.\n\n\"That's dangerous and unsafe even if they are good swimmers,\" says the charity's founder Jay Jaboneta. And many of the children are not.\n\nYet with all the community's boats used for fishing, there's often been no other choice.\n\nThe children had to bundle their books and uniforms in plastic bags to keep them dry as they make their long and arduous way to school.\n\n\"I didn't know about this situation - when I found out I was shocked and posted about it on Facebook,\" said Mr Jaboneta, who grew up nearby.\n\nThings then started snowballing when many of his friends responded - and some began pledging money to help the situation.\n\nImage copyright Facebook Image caption A few hundred dollars are often enough to help\n\nToday, the foundation is active all across the Philippines, primarily funding school boats - all painted in bright yellow corresponding to the colour of the country's school buses.\n\nA small boat costs about $200 (\u00a3150) and will fit around six to eight children, who will have to row it themselves.\n\nThe bigger boats, some of which even have an engine, are steered by an older student, parent or teacher.\n\nBoats, dormitories, a mobile classroom\n\nAs the charity has grown over the years, they have also taken on some other projects to help poor or remote communities accessing education.\n\n\"The problems that such communities face are very different from case to case,\" explains Mr Jaboneta.\n\nIn some projects they've built dormitories for children who otherwise would have to walk for hours to get to school.\n\nOne of the latest projects is a large boat equipped with education material so that it can be taken to remote communities by a teacher and serve as a mobile classroom.\n\nImage copyright Yellow boat of hope foundation Image caption The boats are yellow to correspond to the country's school buses\n\nOverall, the charity has worked with almost 200 communities since 2010, the founder explains.\n\n\"Usually we work with the community leaders or the local schools,\" says Mr Jaboneta.\n\n\"Once we have funded a boat they can then take over the project and operate things themselves.\"\n\nDonations for the work come mostly from the Philippines, he explains. An exception was 2013, after the country had been battered by deadly typhoon Haiyan - in the wake of this and the global headlines that came with it, there were also some donations from abroad.\n\nBut usually, the money comes from locals who want to help making a difference.\n\nImage copyright Yellow Boat of Hope Foundation Image caption Most of the small boats have to be rowed by the pupils themselves\n\nGiven the project was kick-started on Facebook, it's often praised as an example of what an impact social media can have in stories like this.\n\nAnd while Mr Jaboneta agrees that his posts at the very beginning were crucial to getting things going, he cautions that there remains a huge offline element to it.\n\nHe and co-founder Anton Lim have to call donors, sit down with them, go out and co-ordinate things with the local community leaders - it remains a lot of work, which is still entirely done by volunteers.\n\n\"I never imagined that a boat could be something so important, that it could make such a difference,\" Mr Jaboneta saying, summing up his experience of the past years.\n\n\"The Philippines is an archipelago of around 7,000 islands so there are boats everywhere - some estimates say it's about a million across the country. And so you can easily make the mistake of taking them for granted.\""

    "text": "There were no signposts in the desert, but Faraj Mahmoud knew the way. A veteran guide of the mountain-dwelling Jebeleya tribe, he was escorting me \u2013 bumpily, in a 4x4 \u2013 to the Blue Desert in Egypt\u2019s South Sinai. We rattled onto the plain, named after its now faded cerulean rocks, painted in 1980 by Belgian artist Jean Verame to mark the previous year\u2019s Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty.\n\nI was joining a group of hikers that had set out eight days earlier from coastal Nuweiba, crossing the lands of the Tarabin and Muzeina, two of the founding Bedouin tribes behind the Sinai Trail, Egypt\u2019s first long-distance hike. I was cutting in for the 50km-long, Jebeleya-guided \u2018Roof of Egypt\u2019 climax, which spans the Sinai Peninsula\u2019s most iconic peaks and Unesco-listed St Catherine\u2019s Monastery. After a mercifully short wait under the blazing late-morning sun, the hikers\u2019 scattered silhouettes emerged like a mirage on the horizon.\n\nPeople forgot this way\n\nThe Sinai Trail has been dubbed one of the best new hikes in the world by Wanderlust magazine, and was awarded best new tourism initiative, 'Wider World' by the British Guild of Travel Writers in 2016. While there are harder, headier walks, none are so rich with history \u2013 and none are built upon such unlikely bonds.\n\nBedouin tribes have long escorted pilgrims from all corners across the Sinai \u2013 Muslims en route to Mecca, Christians to St Catherine or Jerusalem \u2013 with each tribe handing them to the next at its border. \u201cThen came cars and planes, and people forgot this way,\u201d Mahmoud said. Deprived of guiding work, many Bedouin sought jobs in the city. The Sinai Trail, a fusion of old pilgrimage, trade and smuggling routes, counters that.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 A side of Palestine that\u2019s rarely seen\n\n\u2022 The temples that had to be moved\n\n\u2022 Was this the first Dead Sea Scroll?\n\nThe granite peak of Mount Sinai, the trail\u2019s most iconic landmark, is where Moses received the Ten Commandments, according to the Book of Exodus. It\u2019s also where, much later, Ben Hoffler encountered Mahmoud. One was an earnest young English geography graduate keen to discover the region, the other a gruff outdoorsman and BBC documentary fixer decades his senior, who knew the Sinai better than anyone. Without realising it, the improbable duo would pave the way for the Sinai Trail.\n\nI got the story of their 2008 meeting twice, like superimposed images. \u201cOne day I\u2019m at the top of Mount Moses waiting for the sun to rise,\u201d Mahmoud said, using another of Mount Sinai\u2019s monikers. \u201cI find a man taking a lot of pictures, and I feel that this man has something, like something lost. I feel that this man can help.\u201d\n\nAs soon as I saw the sun coming up, something woke up\n\nIt wasn\u2019t something lost, but found: post-degree at Oxford University, Hoffler had worked for a year in Cairo and then drifted, not drawn to the typical path of a house and family. Then came the Mount Sinai epiphany. \u201cAs soon as I saw the sun coming up, something woke up,\u201d Hoffler told me. \u201cI had to come back to the Sinai and do a different mountain. But every time I got to the top of one mountain, I saw three more that I wanted to climb.\u201d\n\nHoffler\u2019s guide that day had seemed to be phoning it in, with Mahmoud interjecting to field Hoffler\u2019s many questions about the surrounding landscape. They swapped numbers and met to walk and talk whenever Hoffler came down from Cairo. His eventual move to the town of St Catherine, which sprouted around the storied monastery, cementing their bond.\n\nAs Hoffler\u2019s interest in the mountains morphed into an all-out fascination with the Bedouins\u2019 nomadic ways, he spent a decade hiking 10,000km across the peninsula (resulting in a book, Sinai \u2013 The Trekking Guide). All the while Mahmoud strode at his side or called on connections to remotely smooth the way. \u201cI'm not sure why Faraj helped me,\u201d admitted Hoffler, too embarrassed to ever ask. \u201cMaybe he saw us as similar in a way.\u201d\n\nPost-2011 Arab Spring, Sinai tourism collapsed, preoccupying both men. Mahmoud felt that Bedouin guides must unite to survive, rather than running scattered hikes across the region. Hoffler cited the success of long-distance routes like the Jordan Trail \u2013 and they decided that their best chance was to focus on a single path, uniting swathes of the community around it.\n\nMahmoud, a Jebeleya leader well respected across the peninsula, approached the Sinai Trail\u2019s two other founding tribes, and selected representatives with enough sway to get things done.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the unsung hero of the Sinai Trail,\u201d said Hoffler, who is a co-founder but not credited on the Sinai Trail website. Mahmoud is credited, but reticent about his role. I had to drag this story of the trail\u2019s founding out of both of them; it doesn\u2019t appear anywhere.\n\nThe trail launched in 2015, weeks before terrorists downed a Russian airliner over the Sinai, adding to existing woes (the region is still red-lit by most governments). But with the awards came hope \u2013 and venturesome Cairenes, their trip photos blazing a virtual trail that\u2019s boosted traffic on the real one.\n\nJoining 16 hikers, bound by blisters, was as disorienting for me as the relentless, rocky landscape soon pounding my shoes. The first night, at 1,670m, we huddled around a fire in a windswept valley under a canopy of stars. The routine was quickly set for the next three days: wake at sunrise, walk for four or more hours, and shrink back into the scant shadows for lunch \u2013 feta and salad wraps, oil and juice dripping onto the burning rocks \u2013 and a siesta. Several strenuous hours later we\u2019d reunite with the camels bearing our camping gear, and have dinner and a fireside story from charismatic Jebeleya head guide Nasser Mansour. We zipped tents at a tame 20:00.\n\nMansour has been showing visitors the Jebeleya\u2019s backyard for 20 years (his ancestors first came to the area in the 6th Century, to protect the monastery). In taking logistics off his hands, the trail has made his life far easier. \u201cI wish it had happened 10 years ago,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the Bedouin culture slipping away, Mansour\u2019s nightly tales, passed down from those forebears, felt like testimonies. \u201cPeople need to know our history,\u201d he said. \u201cJust to see is not enough; you also have to listen.\u201d While he could identify the other tribes from a distance, they\u2019d been ships in the night before the Sinai Trail. Now they run like a relay team. \u201cWhen we work together we are stronger,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYalla bina,\u201d Mansour yelled in the morning, dragging on a roll-up. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d By lunch we made camp near Elijah\u2019s Basin, washing in a rare well with a tin of Cretan olive oil. That night, high above our tents, my head torch illuminated a pair of eyes. Exposed, I froze in horror, but the camel regarded me dully through long lashes: he\u2019d seen it all before.\n\nNo-one had been blas\u00e9 a few hours earlier when three mountain ibex appeared midway up Mount Sinai\u2019s final 750 torturous Steps of Repentance, begun by a sinful 6th-Century monk. We tiptoed higher, penitent when they scarpered, but soon were consoled by the summit, its Toblerone-shaped shadow projecting back on the ridge that we\u2019d come from.\n\nHeading to Mount Catherine, we took ancient paths laid by the Byzantines, early patrons of the \u2018Sacred Monastery of the God-Trodden Mount Sinai\u2019, to pay St Catherine her dues (the monastery is alleged to house the Burning Bush, from which God revealed himself to Moses). \u201cPeople say there are no more places like this in the world,\u201d Mansour said. Switching back across blazing slopes behind the camels, we piled onto the snug summit, higher than all in Egypt \u2013 an equally beguiling thought.\n\nA forlorn brick shelter with a metal roof semi-open to the stars housed our final dinner: warming lentil soup and vegetable pasta with memorably yellow cheese. After a story about the saint whose mountain we sat upon (monks found her body after a dream), one of our group asked Mansour if he had a dream. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, not elaborating. And then, finally: \u201cTo continue living in the mountains, just like this.\u201d\n\nAnd it seems that his dream will become a reality. Three weeks later, in early May 2018, the Sinai Trail expanded from 220km to 550km, with five more Bedouin tribes joining the co-op after the founders saw the chance to extend its benefits and do further justice to the Sinai\u2019s legendary sights. By reviving age-old union the Towarah Alliance, which once bound seven South Sinai tribes (and adding the Tarabin, who were not part of the original agreement), it has opened up a travelling route not hiked in more than a century, according to Hoffler \u2013 bolstering the Bedouins\u2019 heritage and shifting visitors\u2019 perspectives of a region that, right now, severely needs it.\n\nJust to see is not enough; you also have to listen\n\nOur hike was to be the last on the original trail; it is now possible to cross the whole Sinai Peninsula, from the Gulfs of Aqaba to Suez, in 42 days. The first organised group hike of the new route, which is the most viable option for solo hikers, is slated to begin on 26 October 2018. It will last 24 days (the first through-hike will happen in 2019), with the possibility to join halfway through.\n\n\u201cPeople look different when they come in from the desert,\u201d Hoffler had told me intently, and the romantic proposition had lodged in my head. Now, like an echo, I heard Mahmoud: \u201cFor some people, the Sinai is like medicine, it can fix your problems,\u201d he told me. \u201cForty-two days in the desert is really not easy,\u201d \u2013 longer than Moses on his mount \u2013 \u201cbut some people need it I think.\u201d\n\nSinai Trail highlights Outside of organised group hikes, individuals can walk any part of the 550km trail, from one to 42 days, at any time. A guide is obligatory. These three hikes are the most scenic additions to the trail: Jebel Serbal (3-4 days; 25km)\n\nAll towering pinnacles and shadowy ravines, Jebel Serbal is reputed as the Sinai\u2019s most beautiful mountain \u2013 and, long ago, was held to be the real Mount Sinai of biblical fame. Serabit el-Khadem and El Ramla (4-5 days; 65km)\n\nA rugged trek from an old turquoise mining area \u2013 housing the South Sinai\u2019s sole surviving Pharaonic temple \u2013 to the region\u2019s biggest sand desert. Jebel el-Gunna and Jebel Hazeem (4-5 days; 75km)\n\nThese two high, windswept plateaus are ideal for stargazing, and form part of a remote land where, as per Exodus, Moses and his people went astray for 40 years.\n\nFor me, four days wasn\u2019t enough. I\u2019d return, and next time I\u2019d be going the distance.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

    "text": "Anna Bergstrom had a dilemma. She loved the glitzy world of high fashion, but had also come to feel that it was unsustainable and bad for the planet. She's now found peace of mind by running a stylish shopping mall in Sweden, where everything is second-hand.\n\n\"Do you notice the smell?\" Anna Bergstrom says, as she surveys her mall from the mezzanine level. \"It smells nice here, doesn't it?\"\n\nIt's very important to Anna that this place is enticing, because she feels it is making a statement. Everything for sale here, in 14 specialist shops covering everything from clothes to DIY tools, is recycled.\n\nShe is usually turned off by the smell of second-hand stores, she explains, even though she adores vintage fashion.\n\nFor most people flea-markets and charity shops carry a stigma, she thinks - a mark left by countless bad experiences. Too often they are worthy but depressing, Anna says. Her mission is to bring second-hand shopping into the mainstream.\n\nThe mall itself is spacious and appealing, almost Ikea-like. An art installation - a tree and circular bench all fashioned from recycled materials - greets customers at the entrance.\n\nThere is even a coffee shop and gift-wrapping service.\n\nThe mall is called ReTuna. \"Tuna\" because that's the nickname for the city where it is based - Eskilstuna, an hour's train journey west of Stockholm - and \"Re\" because the goods on sale have been recycled or repurposed.\n\nIt was set up by Eskilstuna's local government in 2015, in a warehouse which used to house trucks for a logistics company.\n\nThe shops inside it are run as businesses rather than charities, and each pays a combined charge of rent and business rates.\n\nAnna Bergstrom's business mantra which she repeats to each shopkeeper is, \"Do it like Hugo Boss.\" She wants the mall to stand toe-to-toe with a regular, commercial, glitzy mall.\n\nThere is a sports shop stuffed with skis and (slightly scuffed) sledges, a kids' shop bursting with toys (a little faded), a bookshop, a DIY store, a homeware specialist, even a pet accessory shop.\n\nAs well as \"pre-loved\" items for sale, there are also many that have been upcycled. These are unwanted items that have been taken apart and turned into new objects.\n\nIn a store that specialises in handmade household ornaments, Bergstrom is keen to show off a nice example of this, from one of her star tenants.\n\nShopkeeper Maria Larsson proudly shows off her best-selling product - a container that resembles the body of a pine cone. Each segment of its skin has been cut from leather jackets - upcycling in action.\n\nHowever, Maria confesses to being a little worried. She is struggling to keep up with customer demand for this design because she can't get enough jackets.\n\nThis makes more sense once you understand ReTuna's location.\n\nIt's right next to Eskilstuna's recycling centre, which is also run by the municipality.\n\nA steady stream of cars passes through it, bringing cardboard, mattresses and other typical unwanted household items.\n\nBut many of these cars go past the metal skips and then head down a ramp to a road that runs right next to the mall.\n\nHere locals drop off their unwanted household things if there is a possibility they can be resold or upcycled.\n\nIn a vast area beneath the mall, a small army of workers in fluorescent jackets sifts through the donations, carrying them to designated zones.\n\nEvery day the shopkeepers can come down and inspect what has arrived: kids' toys, household appliances, gardening equipment\u2026 perhaps even a leather jacket. This is what they call their \"treasure\", says Anna. Their business rent gives them privileged access to it.\n\nShopkeepers sometimes hang around the basement to look at what is coming in to their zones. Anna calls these people \"peekers\" and gives them a telling-off, because they are meant to wait for set times to inspect their assigned stock.\n\nMany of the shopkeepers will come to informal arrangements with one another. So if the clothes shop knows that Larsson wants leather jackets for upcycling, they will pass on any that are too damaged to be re-sold.\n\nAny items that are unwanted by all the shopkeepers go to the recycling centre next door.\n\n\"You see,\" says Anna, \"this is why I sometimes joke that this is the 'high fashion trash shopping mall'.\"\n\nShe thinks her passion for ethical, sustainable shopping goes back to her upbringing with her hippie parents.\n\nShe was born in a commune, though her family moved out to the countryside to pursue a simple life when she was three years old.\n\nHer parents rejected consumerism in all its forms and tried to protect her from it.\n\nShe wasn't allowed Barbie dolls or any toys at all at Christmas, she recalls.\n\nBut as she grew up she reacted against this.\n\n\"Everyone has to be their own punk revolution,\" she says cryptically.\n\nIn fact she ended up forging a career in the temples of modern consumerism: shopping centres. She began by setting up retail shops, then ran two commercial malls in the Stockholm area.\n\nIt was only when she had children - four daughters - that she began to have doubts. She took about a year's maternity leave for each child, which gave her time to reflect. Perhaps maternal instinct revived in her some of the values instilled by her parents, she thinks.\n\nAs her daughters grew, so too did her doubts about the world she'd brought them into, and its throwaway culture.\n\nShe watched them become seduced, as teenagers, by a modern kind of consumerism - their lives became shaped by big brands, promoted by influencers on social media, says Anna. They became governed by whatever the Kardashians were doing on reality TV or Instagram, she says in a tone of dismay - before breaking into a smile.\n\nIn desperation she tried cutting her daughters' pocket money so they couldn't buy the latest clothes, but offered to pay for second-hand ones instead - with limited success.\n\nShe realised she had to do something more, so the opportunity for a job at the ReTuna mall three years ago, as its first manager, came at the perfect time for her.\n\nFind out more\n\nLearn more about the ReTuna mall in the latest People Fixing the World podcast from the BBC World Service\n\n\"I realised that I needed to become a role model for my children, doing something good for the planet,\" says Anna.\n\nShe calls the mall \"my baby\", and wants it to be a place her teenage children are proud to visit.\n\nAnd they do visit. Though she hasn't persuaded them to tag it as a location on an Instagram post yet - she's working on that.\n\nAnna's bigger hope is that what works for her family can work for Swedish society as a whole.\n\nSwedes love the concept of living sustainably and doing things for the planet, but there is a \"gap\" when it comes to action, she says.\n\nAnna thinks her mall can bridge this gap.\n\nAnd there is evidence this may be happening. Sales are slowly rising year-on-year. Since opening, the mall has sold \u00a32.8m worth of products and last year it attracted 700 visitors per day.\n\n\"If you can have a trendy, fashionable way to do sustainable living,\" says Anna, \"I think mainstream customers can follow that - in high heels.\"\n\nYou can follow writer Dougal Shaw on Twitter: @dougalshawbbc\n\nSee more:\n\nYou can take a look around the mall in this video.\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "1. Different locks must be opened with different keys\n\nEvery problem we face in life will require a different set of skills to overcome. In a business context, or when managing relationships, it\u2019s important to recognise that a \u201cone key fits all\u201d approach won\u2019t work! Be flexible and face each new challenge with a fresh outlook and the right tools.\n\n2. A blind horse always frightens itself\n\nMost of us will have \u2013 at some point or another \u2013 wound ourselves up into a state of anxiety or fear when going in to a situation ill-informed. Feeling unprepared and out of one\u2019s depth can easily lead to panic. This proverb reminds us that learning the lay of the land will help us to keep calm and know what plan of action to take.\n\n3. You must enter the tiger\u2019s den to catch his cubs\n\nThis is an animal-based alternative to the expression \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d or \u201cnothing ventured, nothing gained.\u201d And it reminds us that success in any enterprise requires taking a few risks \u2013 sometimes we need to make ourselves vulnerable in order to get what we want. A good example is throwing oneself head first into a new relationship: there\u2019s always a chance of getting hurt, but in opening yourself up you might just find life-long love\u2026"

    "text": "We want to be the home for the most ambitious, most challenging, most moving ideas. Our ambition is to make programmes that are central to peoples lives.\n\nSir David Attenborough returns to BBC One for One Planet, Seven Worlds\n\nBBC One to show Green Planet, the latest in the Planet series examining the incredible world of plants\n\nEnvironmental programming from Chris Packham, Liz Bonnin and Springwatch\n\nNew programming for Mental Health Season from Nadiya Hussain, Alastair Campbell and David Harewood\n\nNew documentaries with Ed Balls, Mobeen Azhar, George McGavin and Louis Theroux\n\nAlison Kirkham says: \"The BBC has a unique commitment to factual programming. I don\u2019t believe any other broadcaster in British television has such an extraordinary breath of output in factual. Plenty of other broadcasters are now following our lead, but we\u2019re determined to keep moving the conversation forwards. That\u2019s what makes the BBC special - the desire to anticipate and stimulate the national conversation, not motivated by commercial imperatives or what\u2019s in fashion.\n\n\"The BBC has a unique ability to bring the nation together. We reached over 22 million people with our coverage of that Royal Wedding and 20 million joined us across the weekend commemorating the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, they\u2019re moments that create powerful shared cultural experiences. Later this year we\u2019ll be covering the moving ceremonies to commemorate D-Day, 75 years on.\n\n\"It\u2019s always been important to me that we are a department with integrity and in turn it means that people have been generous enough to trust us with their most intimate stories - be that filmmakers, contributors, or famous faces. Tonight I re-affirm that commitment. We want to be the home for creatives to do their most personal work, and to seek out the untold stories. We want to be the home for the most ambitious, most challenging, most moving ideas. Our ambition is to make programmes that are central to peoples lives.\"\n\nAn ongoing commitment to the environmental story will play a key role across the BBC with a number of new commissions focussed around Protecting Our Planet. Following the huge global impact of Blue Planet II, watched by more than three quarters of a billion people worldwide, the BBC\u2019s work around Plastics Watch and the forthcoming Blue Planet Live on BBC One, Alison announced new programmes including Green Planet (w/t); Meat: A Threat To Planet Earth with Liz Bonnin; Population With Chris Packham and a Springwatch call to action to record the health of British wildlife today.\n\nSir David Attenborough also returns to BBC One to present the natural history landmark One Planet, Seven Worlds (w/t) later this year.\n\nIn May the BBC will shine a light on mental health to mark Mental Health Awareness week with new documentaries from Nadiya Hussain, David Harewood and Alastair Campbell, and a BBC Three film looking at the rate of suicide in young people in the armed forces..Following its coverage last year to mark the end of WWI, which brought 20 million viewers to the BBC across one weekend, this summer, the BBC will mark the 75th anniversary of D Day, with moving coverage of the commemorations in both Portsmouth and Normandy. And over the next five years the BBC will be remembering a number of WWII milestones, with programmes including Robert Rinder's exploration of families\u2019 experiences in the two part series, My Family, The Holocaust And Me on BBC One; a film marking the liberation of Belsen; and a series uncovering The Rise Of The Nazis for BBC Two . The BBC has a unique ability to bring untold and complex stories to the nation, and will continue to tackle challenging subject matters with Ed Balls on the future of Europe; The Dad Who Gave Birth: Seahorse tells the extraordinary story of a transgender man\u2019s quest to start a family; and Arthur Cary follows patients with terminal cancer through \u2018first in-human\u2019 trials for CAR T-cell therapy. BBC Three will tackle the harrowing subject of coercive control in Abused By My Girlfriend. On BBC Four, George McGavin will present a very personal film on living with cancer and a film on quantum entanglement, Einstein\u2019s Quantum Riddle.\n\nTD"

I set myself a week. I thought it should be quite easy.\"\n\nImage copyright Andy Twigge\n\nHe almost managed it, but quit on day seven. The thing that broke him? A Sunday roast.\n\n\"I stuck at it for six days. I even ate tinned Brussels sprouts!\n\n\"I did have a Fray Bentos pie, and that was very nice, but it did all become a bit of a chore. I was physically fine on it though. I didn't waste away or anything.\" He says he's not sure he would call what he did \"nutritional\".\n\nBecause he was only doing the diet for a short period, Andy didn't check with a dietitian.\n\nBut we have, and here's what they think.\n\nLess nutritious?\n\nTo be tinned, foods are sealed and preserved by pressure cooking them at a very high temperature.\n\nLike regular cooking, this destroys some of the nutrients.\n\nCanned foods are often thought to be less nutritious than fresh or frozen foods because of this. But that's not always the case, say diet experts.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nBridget Benelam is a nutrition scientist at the British Nutrition Foundation.\n\nShe says: \"Generally speaking, there's a wide range of canned foods that you could eat - from fruit, veg, potatoes and pulses to fish and ready-made foods like soup, baked beans or chilli.\n\n\"And some of them are nutritionally better than others. Tinned oily fish like salmon, for example, is healthy. And beans and pulses, like chickpeas and lentils, are a good source of protein and fibre while being low in fat.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there's not a lot of data about nutrients in canned food versus fresh or frozen.\"\n\nShe said the main nutrients that could be lost or diminished in the canning process were some of the water-soluble vitamins which cannot be stored by the body and are vital for healthy skin, blood vessels and bones, and the nervous system.\n\nLost vitamins\n\nResearchers have attempted to measure the loss, comparing fresh, frozen and canned fruit and veg.\n\nFindings suggest that although frozen foods lose fewer nutrients initially when they are packaged, when you get them home and eventually boil them, they can lose a similar amount to the tinned version.\n\nLikewise, although freshly picked, uncooked fruit and veg contain lots of nutrients, these will degrade over time, even when you store them in the fridge.\n\nBridget says: \"With tinned foods, there may be some losses of nutrients like vitamin C and thiamine, which can be lost when cooking, but whether this would have an impact on health would depend on the diet overall.\n\n\"Nutritionally, it could be OK, as long as you get a good mix. My main concern would be the tedium. The texture could be quite dull. Food can get a bit mushed and squished when it is canned. You won't be able to have tinned salad, so you'd have to make sure you are getting the right variety of food.\"\n\nSo, when it comes to picking, what are the pitfalls?\n\nWhat to buy\n\nDietitian Frankie Phillips, from the British Dietetic Association, agrees that variety is the key.\n\n\"You'd be fine over a few days, but a tinned food diet might be quite limiting over a long period of time. You'd need to be quite careful about what cans you choose to eat.\"\n\nIngredients such as salt, sugar and fat are sometimes added to processed foods to make their flavour more appealing.\n\nThat means you could consume more than the recommended amounts and take on more calories than you need. \"This is where you might fall down in terms of nutrition,\" says Frankie.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nFruit tinned in syrup will contain lots of sugar, for example, and vegetables in brine will be salty.\n\nBut all fruit and veg canned in their own juice will count towards your 5-a-day.\n\nFrankie says: \"It should be quite easy to get most of your major food groups, such as protein, carbohydrates. Dairy might be a bit harder.\n\n\"One of the concerns I would have is around canned meats. They are generally quite salty because of the way they are preserved.\n\n\"Nutrition labels on cans will help guide you,\" says Frankie. The guidelines for adults are:\n\nTotal fat - High: more than 17.5g of fat per 100g, Low: 3g of fat or less per 100g\n\nSaturated fat - High: more than 5g of saturated fat per 100g, Low: 1.5g of saturated fat or less per 100g\n\nSugars - High: more than 22.5g of total sugars per 100g, Low: 5g of total sugars or less per 100g\n\nSalt - High: more than 1.5g of salt per 100g (or 0.6g sodium), Low: 0.3g of salt or less per 100g (or 0.1g sodium)\n\nThere are some other practical considerations too, including food safety.\n\nIs it OK to keep leftovers in my fridge?\n\nCans are made of steel, with a fine coating of tin or chromium oxide to protect them from rusting. For acidic foods like tomatoes, a thin coating or lacquer is needed on the inside of the can.\n\nWhen you open a can of food and you're not going to use all the food straightaway, empty the food into a bowl, or another container, and put it in the fridge, food safety experts advise.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIt's best not to store food in an opened tin can, or re-use empty cans to cook or store food. This is because when a can has been opened and the food is open to the air, the tin from the can might transfer more quickly to the can's contents.\n\nThis advice doesn't apply to foods sold in cans that have resealable lids, such as golden syrup and cocoa, because these types of food don't react with the can.\n\nThe US food safety regulator has some more advice:\n\nHeed the sell-by date - Check your pantry every few weeks and use canned goods you have had on hand for awhile. High-acid canned foods, such as tomatoes, pineapple and pickles, will store well for 12 to 18 months. Low-acid canned foods such as spaghetti, potatoes and beans, will store well for two to five years.\n\n- Check your pantry every few weeks and use canned goods you have had on hand for awhile. High-acid canned foods, such as tomatoes, pineapple and pickles, will store well for 12 to 18 months. Low-acid canned foods such as spaghetti, potatoes and beans, will store well for two to five years. Beware damaged cans - If a can containing food has a small dent, but is otherwise in good shape, the food is probably safe to eat. A bulging lid, or a dented or leaking can is a sign of spoilage. When you open it, look for other signs, such as spurting liquid, an \"off\" odour or mould. Don't taste or use these canned foods. Throw them away immediately.\n\n- If a can containing food has a small dent, but is otherwise in good shape, the food is probably safe to eat.

Throw them away immediately. Is it normal to hear a \"hiss\" when you open it? - Some cans may hiss because they are vacuum-packed and the noise is a result of air pressure, which is perfectly normal. However, if a can hisses loudly or spurts forcefully when opened, it may be an indication that the food is spoiled and should be discarded.\n\nWhat about the chemicals?\n\nSome people worry that cans can contain harmful chemicals, including a substance called Bisohenol A (BPA).\n\nBPA is mainly used to make plastics, including containers that come into contact with food, but it's also used to make some protective coatings and linings for food and drinks cans.\n\nThe UK's Food Standards Agency has examined BPA, and says that levels of the compound people would typically consume do not represent a risk to consumers.\n\nThe European Food Safety Authority has also assessed the evidence and says dietary exposure to BPA is \"not a health concern for any age group\".\n\nThe US National Toxicology Programme has been carrying out a long-term study into BPA, looking at the effects of exposure in rats before and after giving birth to see if there might be any link to diseases such as cancer. A final report is expected in the autumn of 2019.\n\nOther canny facts\n\nThe history of canning is said to have begun with Napoleon. It's believed he offered 12,000 French francs to anyone who could find a way to prevent military food supplies from spoiling. Napoleon gave the prize in 1795 to Nicholas Appert, who invented the process of packing meat and poultry in glass bottles, corking them, and submerging them in boiling water.\n\nThis military secret soon reached England where, in 1810, Peter Durand patented the use of metal containers for canning.\n\nToday, we still love canned food. According to consumer research group Kantar Worldpanel, people in the UK spent more than half a billion pounds on tinned food during the 12 weeks to 30 December 2018. Unsurprisingly, we tend to buy more canned products over winter than summer.\n\nA study of 2,000 adults carried out for the Metal Packaging Manufacturers Association found the average adult has 16 cans of food in their cupboard and relies on tinned food for at least three meals a week.\n\nBaked beans were named as the most popular canned food to use in everyday cooking, followed by tinned tomatoes, soup, fish such as tuna and salmon and other vegetables such as sweetcorn."

    "text": "Eight of Africa\u2019s vulture species have declined by an average of 62 per cent in the past 30 years, for some species that number is as high as 80 per cent; the threats facing these creatures are extensive.\n\nIt\u2019s just before 1pm and hungry guests are starting to emerge out onto the wooden decking at the back of the Victoria Falls Safari Lodge in Zimbabwe. A few have already settled in for lunch, sipping beer and delving into their sandwiches and salads in the sunshine. At the waterhole below, a few warthogs can be seen trotting around, stopping every now and then to munch some grass. It\u2019s a normal setting - until you look up. Overhead, the sky is filled with several hundred vultures, swooping in giant concentric circles.\n\nHundreds of vultures circle the sky an hour before feeding \u00a9 Harriet Constable\n\nThey too have arrived for their midday snack. Every day the team at this hotel places last night\u2019s leftover meat out for the vultures to eat. They call it the \u2018Vulture Restaurant\u2019 and it\u2019s a vital part of protecting these birds, who have become some of the most endangered species in Africa.\n\nA 2015 report by Darcy Ogada of The Peregrine Fund, a US-based conservation organisation focusing on endangered birds of prey, shows that eight of Africa\u2019s vulture species have declined by an average of 62 per cent in the past 30 years, for some species that number is as high as 80 per cent. The threats facing these creatures are extensive, from habitat loss to being killed for spiritual reasons. In some cultures it is believed that sleeping with a vulture head under your pillow will allow you to see into the future.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, where poaching of elephants and rhinos is a major issue, poisoning posts a significant threat to the birds. \u201c[In recent years] poachers have realised they can use poison to kill animals. It\u2019s effective because it\u2019s silent and therefore doesn\u2019t attract much attention. When the vultures eat the carcasses they die too,\u201d says Roger Parry, Wildlife Manager at Victoria Falls Wildlife Trust, a not-for-profit organisation in Zimbabwe. Knowing that circling vultures can attract the attention of the park rangers, poachers will sometimes even poison an entire water source, to kill the vultures in advance.\n\nKnowing that vultures can attract the attention of the park rangers, poachers will sometimes even poison an entire water source, to kill the vultures in advance \u00a9 Harriet Constable\n\nOf all scavenger species, poisoned carcasses pose a particular threat to vultures because they are social creatures and eat in large groups (known as a wake) of up to 100. In 2013, 500 vultures were killed after feeding on the carcass of a poisoned elephant in Namibia, and in May 2017, 94 critically endangered African White Backed Vultures were found dead on the Zimbabwe/Mozambique border, killed the same way.\n\nVultures are social creatures and eat in large groups \u00a9 Harriet Constable\n\nHuman-wildlife conflict also plays a part in the plight of vultures in Zimbabwe and beyond. \u201cWe get massive losses [of vultures] through predators killing local\u2019s livestock. The community then puts out poisoned bait to kill the predators, vultures eat the dead predator and die too,\u201d says Parry.\n\nThe Vulture Restaurant initiative is part feeding programme, part education programme. By attracting the birds to the Vulture Restaurant every day the team can ensure they\u2019re regularly getting a safe meal, and while the birds are there they can educate tourists from all over the world about these creatures, increasing awareness and support for the cause in the process.\n\nBy attracting the birds to the Vulture Restaurant the team can ensure they\u2019re regularly getting a safe meal \u00a9 Lindsay Constable\n\nBack at the Victoria Falls Safari Lodge the vultures sense that their meal is about to be served and the huge birds begin to swoop down from the skies and settle in the trees. Their broad, strong wings are perfect for gliding through the sky with minimal effort, but coming in to land is less elegant. One by one they slam into the branches with some force, taking a moment or two to compose themselves and get their feathers back in place. There are no tablecloths or sunshades here, just an open patch of ground that marks Vulture Restaurant HQ, with tiered seating in front of it for guests to watch.\n\nThe vulture experience at Victoria Falls has grown in popularity and is now packed every day \u00a9 Lindsay Constable\n\nAlthough most tourists come to this part of the world to visit the astounding sight of 5 million cubic metres of water crashing down at Victoria Falls every minute, the vulture experience has grown in popularity and is now packed every day. \u201cWe have days where we have to limit the number of people going down [to the viewing area] because it gets so busy,\u201d says Ross Kennedy, CEO of Africa Albida Tourism, which runs the lodge.\n\n\u2018Lunch\u2019 is served by Wildlife Supervisor Moses Garira who sees himself as something of a vulture daddy-figure. He has the unenviable task of wandering out into the middle of the clearing with a cool-box full of meat, dropping the contents onto the ground and running for his life as the 200-odd vultures swoop in for their feeding frenzy. It\u2019s a remarkable scene as the mob of huge birds crash and pounce on top of one another, screeching and squaking as they clamber in and fight over the meat, ripping away at muscle with ease. No one, surely, would volunteer for this role, but Garira rather enjoys it. \u201cIt feels great to be so close to the birds, I feel like I am part of them \u2013 it\u2019s not scary at all,\u201d he says, earnestly. Back in the safety of the viewing seats, he spends the next 15 minutes or so telling the onlookers about the importance of vultures to human health, and why we need to protect them.\n\n\u2018Lunch\u2019 is served by Wildlife Supervisor Moses Garira who sees himself as something of a vulture daddy-figure \u00a9 Harriet Constable\n\nOften considered to be creepy, disgusting creatures mainly because of their scavenger tendencies, it turns out humans have got it all wrong when it comes to vultures. \u201cPart of the educational challenge is to get people to realise these birds are not horrible - they are extremely important. They\u2019re beautiful birds, and they are hugely important in terms of their role cleaning up the dead carcasses in the bush,\u201d says Parry. Notably, they\u2019re safely able to digest nasty bacteria like Anthrax, where other scavengers are not. Without vultures, there\u2019d be a lot more disease in the world.\n\nBut will the vulture restaurant actually be able to make a significant difference to the plight of vultures in Zimbabwe? Kerri Wolter, CEO of Vulpro, a South African vulture conservation organisation, believes it can play an important part when teamed with other solutions like government funding for conservation and harsher penalties for killing vultures. Improving the general public\u2019s awareness and support is a big part of the battle, and the vulture restaurant achieves this. \u201cIf we are going to win, we have to get people to like vultures,\u201d she says.\n\nBy Harriet Constable\n\nFeatured image by IVANVIEITO/Getty"

    "title": "What is endometriosis?",

      "Aim\u00e9e Grant Cumberbatch"
    ],
    "text": "My painful periods started when I was about 14. I wore heat patches to school in the hope that they would help me last through the day. Sometimes they did. But sometimes I ended up in sick bay writhing in agony on the fold-out bed, where the receptionists didn\u2019t know what to suggest because I\u2019d already had my appendix removed.\n\nTen years of pain later, I\u2019m finally in the process of being diagnosed with endometriosis. But far from simplifying my issues, what I\u2019ve seen during my many doctor\u2019s appointments is that the disease remains poorly understood \u2013 and that its diagnosis and treatment can be a complicated and life-long ordeal.\n\nEndometriosis is a gynaecological condition associated with menstruation where tissue similar to the lining of the womb is found in other areas of the body, including the fallopian tubes, pelvis, bowel, vagina and intestines. In rare cases it has even been found in the lungs, eyes, spine and brain \u2013 in fact, the only place in the body it has never been found is the spleen. Symptoms include severe, sometimes debilitating, pelvic pain, fatigue and heavy periods.\n\nWhile there are many lesser-known health conditions which are underfunded and under-researched, few are as common as endometriosis, which affects about 176m people globally. In the US, where, as in other countries, it\u2019s estimated to affect one in 10 women of reproductive age, it receives about $6m (\u00a34.7m) in research funding each year. Sleep research alone receives more than 50 times that amount.\n\nMore in the Health Gap:\n\n\u2022 The mystery of the pelvic floor\n\n\u2022 What is vulvodynia?\n\n\u2022 The case for renaming women\u2019s body parts\n\nPain isn\u2019t the only consequence of endometriosis. One study across 10 countries found that endometriosis costs each patient an average annual total of \u20ac9,579 (\u00a38,600) in healthcare, productivity and quality of life costs \u2013 that\u2019s more than \u20ac26 (\u00a323.45) a day. It may be linked to infertility. And then there is the chance that the pain itself makes patients vulnerable to other conditions.\n\n\u201cWe have good evidence that having serious pain alters your central nervous system, alters how you respond to pain in the future and makes you potentially more susceptible to other chronic pain conditions,\u201d says Katy Vincent, a senior pain fellow at the University of Oxford.\n\nFor women who are symptomatic, and many are not, the primary symptom is usually acute pelvic pain with no obvious physical cause. That may make it enigmatic. But that it was a health condition experienced only by women \u2013 and is linked to menstruation, in particular \u2013 has made it more of an enigma than it perhaps could be.\n\nAncient origins\n\nMicroscopic discovery of endometriosis is most often attributed to Czech scientist Karl von Rokitansky in 1860, though this is disputed and previous more rudimentary microscopic discoveries have also been recorded. Records of endometriosis-like symptoms, meanwhile, date back to antiquity. It also has an overlap with the condition \u2018hysteria\u2019, which derives for a Latin word for \u201cof the womb\u201d: one study of representations of pelvic pain in medical literature found that many cases dismissed as \u201chysteria\u201d may well have been endometriosis. \u201cThe original meaning of hysteric convulsions during this era generally referred to women falling to the ground, doubled over in a foetal position,\u201d the study notes. \u201cThey could very easily be describing a response to acute abdominal pain.\u201d\n\nThe historic underestimation and misunderstanding of endometriosis continues to inform modern medicine. Researched less than other conditions, it\u2019s also less understood. The cause of endometriosis is not known. There is no cure. It often takes up to around a decade to get diagnosed, and the only means of definitive diagnosis is a form of keyhole surgery known as laparoscopy.\n\nI never remember a single GP or hospital doctor, anybody, saying the word \u2018endometriosis\u2019. Or just even asking the right questions \u2013 Alice Bodenham\n\nI spoke to three women now diagnosed with endometriosis, all in their 20s and 30s. Along the way, all three had been misdiagnosed with other conditions and had their symptoms dismissed or underestimated. \u201cI never remember a single GP or hospital doctor, anybody, saying the word \u2018endometriosis\u2019. Or just even asking the right questions,\u201d says Alice Bodenham, 31. \u201cIt\u2019s very much \u2018it could be this\u2019, or \u2018you\u2019re making it up\u2019.\u201d\n\nPart of the problem is the systemic tendency to dismiss women\u2019s pain, when pain is of the most common symptoms of endometriosis. I experienced this myself when I found one internal ultrasound scan acutely painful and informed the doctors: I later received my results in the post with the note \u201cpatient experienced mild discomfort during scan\u201d. Making matters worse, there\u2019s no correlation between the level of pain experienced and the severity of an individual\u2019s condition.\n\nAs there are no non-invasive means of definitive diagnosis, without a physician believing a patient\u2019s description of symptoms, there\u2019s no referral for a diagnosis. But women\u2019s symptoms, too, are often dismissed as being \u201call in your head\u201d.\n\nOne UK survey found of 2,600 women with endometriosis found that 40% had visited the doctor 10 or more times before being referred to a specialist\n\nIt may be little surprise, then, that one UK government survey of 2,600 women with endometriosis found that 40% had visited the doctor 10 or more times before being referred to a specialist. Bodenham, for example, collapsed multiple times before her pain was taken seriously.\n\nCaitlin Conyers, 24, who runs the blog My Endometriosis Diary, began to suspect she might have the condition through her own research, but this was dismissed by her physicians. \u201cAbout three years ago I ended up in an urgent care centre. I\u2019d been Googling the different causes and one was endometriosis and I did suggest this to the doctor at the time and they just said, \u2018Oh no, it definitely isn\u2019t that\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cI explained that I had really bad period pain and general abdomen pain and they still said no.\u201d\n\nOxford\u2019s Vincent isn\u2019t hesitant about whether gender plays a role. \u201cIf every 14-year-old boy went to the GP saying, \u2018I miss two days of school every month\u2019, they would stop missing school every month,\u201d she says.\n\nMaking matters more complicated, physicians also sometimes fail to find evidence of lesions on initial scans, particularly if the lesions are superficial. Endometriosis forums are littered with stories of false negative ultrasound scans.\n\nA lack of awareness on the patient side can delay diagnosis too. Menstrual taboos still persist and two of the women I spoke to reported being told, whether by family or through sexual education, that periods might be painful or uncomfortable. What they never understood was how painful (or not) a normal period should be.\n\nEndometriosis charities and campaigners around the world are working to raise awareness, and their efforts seem to hav helped. In 2017 the Australian government launched a National Action Plan For Endometriosis which seeks to \u201cimprove the treatment, understanding and awareness\u201d of the condition, and increased funding to A$4.5m (\u00a32.5m), new clinical guidelines and \u2013 crucially \u2013 for the subject to be made part of primary healthcare professionals\u2019 medical education. In the UK, government advisory body the National Institute for Health And Care Excellent (Nice) released guidelines in 2017 with the aim of standardising diagnosis and treatment pathways for patients.\n\nBut while that\u2019s a good step in the right direction, there already are many guidelines for GPs to juggle, says Anne Connolly, clinical champion for women\u2019s health at the Royal College of GPs. Lone Hummelshoj, chief executive of the World Endometriosis Society, adds that the lack of specialist centres is another worldwide problem.\n\nNo quick fix\n\nEven after a diagnosis is reached, symptom management is by no means straightforward \u2013and misinformation persists here too.\n\nSome medical practitioners still tell patients pregnancy is an effective treatment. One physician this year told me she suspected endometriosis \u2013 but, she added, \u201cthere\u2019s not much we can do unless you fancy getting pregnant\u201d. Given that the disease can impact fertility of patients, this seems at the very least insensitive. It\u2019s also inaccurate: while it may relieve symptoms of endometriosis, it\u2019s only for the duration of the pregnancy.\n\nMeanwhile, writer and performer Lena Dunham raised the profile of hysterectomy as a treatment for endometriosis by writing about her choice to undergo the surgery in Vogue US earlier this year. But its use as a treatment for endometriosis is controversial. As the condition is characterised by lesions outside of the uterus not inside of it, its removal is by no means a cure and endometriosis can recur afterwards.\n\nHysterectomy is by no means a cure and endometriosis can recur afterwards\n\nBecause the development of endometriosis lesions is controlled by oestrogen, hormonal treatments are often one of the first prescribed. These can help manage the condition, but do not cure it, and can have their own side effects. A 2016 study by researchers in Denmark found that women using hormonal contraceptives were more likely to seek treatment for depression. (Watch our video on eight women who experienced serious side effects from the contraceptive pill).\n\nAnother potential treatment is medical menopause. However, it is not a long-term option because it can affect bone density, particularly in young people, and, although rare, one of the potential side effects cited by the brand Zoladex is accidental full menopause. Cook told me there is a lack of informed consent around the use of this treatment. She says, \u201cOne of the things I hear a lot of is the number of women who end up taking drugs or having injections to go into medical menopause and they do not realise that\u2019s what it is.\u201d\n\nAs such, there is research ongoing into potential alternatives.\n\n\u201cDrug treatments for endometriosis are entirely focused on hormones and we need something else because we know for a lot of women that doesn\u2019t work very well,\u201d says Krina Zondervan, a professor of reproductive and genomic epidemiology at the University of Oxford. \u201cAnd it gives a lot of side effects that women are not that happy to experience in the long term.\u201d\n\nAlthough they treat only the symptoms, not the condition, painkillers are another option. But they aren\u2019t without adverse effect, either. Bodenham tells me how the opioid painkillers she\u2019s been taking for the past three years have left her with a constellation of side-effects including \u201canaemia and hypertension\u201d. She says, \u201cI used to run a 5k every week\u2026 and now some days just walking downstairs to get a glass of water feels like doing a marathon.\u201d\n\nDespite this, Bodenham feels lucky to receive them \u2013 she knows trying to access strong painkillers can lead to accusations of addiction. (There is also a risk that use of opioid painkillers will lead to abuse or dependency, although this is small among those with no history of substance abuse or addiction.)\n\n\n\nThere is some hope. The illness\u2019 profile is on the rise and efforts are being made to educate GPs and patients about pelvic pain. But as patients wait for the medical system to catch up, their symptoms are still being misunderstood and their illnesses misdiagnosed with serious mental and physical health consequences.\n\nHaving found that birth control adversely affected my mental health, my next step is deciding whether to start treatment via the Mirena coil\u2019s low dose of hormone, or to continue pursuing a definitive diagnosis via laparoscopy. But laparoscopy would require several weeks of recovery \u2013 and as a freelance writer with little job stability, I would need more savings than I have. It\u2019s one more example of the difficult choices women with chronic pelvic pain face every day.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story inaccurately described one of Krystal Rodriguez\u2019s symptoms as collapsing. This has been changed. We regret the error.\n\nThis story is part of the Health Gap, a special series about how men and women experience the medical system \u2013 and their own health \u2013 in starkly different ways.\n\nDo you have an experience to share?

If they do, heat your key with a lighter to melt the ice.\n\nBut if you fancy a more extreme solution, you could take the approach Russians used to de-ice their airplanes: find leftover jet fighter engines and use them to blast hot air at the affected areas. (Results not guaranteed.)\n\nHow can I boost my immune system in the winter weather?\n\nImage copyright PA wire\n\nSadly, rounding off your lunch of crisps and chocolate with a fizzy vitamin C tablet isn't a surefire way to stave off the office cold.\n\nIt mainly comes down to - no surprises here - eating well, sleeping properly, and exercising enough.\n\nThe NHS recommends eating plenty of fruit and veg, as well as a hearty breakfast to set you up for the day.\n\nMilk and dairy products such as cheese, yoghurt and fromage frais are also great sources of protein, vitamins and calcium.\n\nAt what temperature does snow fall?\n\nImage copyright PA wire\n\nContrary to popular belief, it doesn't have to be below zero to snow.\n\nYou can start wishing for a snow day as soon as the temperature drops below 2\u00b0C.\n\nAccording to the Met Office, most of the UK's heaviest snowfalls tend to be when the temperature sits between 0\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C.\n\nAny hotter than that and the snowflakes will melt and fall as sleet or rain.\n\nWhy does salt melt ice?\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nGritters may have been out in force - but the \"grit\" they've been laying is actually rock salt.\n\nSalt lowers the freezing point of water, so it stops ice forming and causes existing ice or snow to melt.\n\nHow should I drive in snow and icy conditions?\n\nIn a word, carefully. Stopping distances are greater in snow and ice.\n\nAllow extra time, plan your journey, wear warm clothes, and make sure your phone is properly charged.\n\nStock up on chocolate, biscuits and hot drinks, in case you get stuck.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Five handy winter driving tips\n\nAfter de-icing your car, use second gear to pull away, lifting the clutch gently to avoid wheel spin.\n\nStay in a higher gear for better control as you pick up speed.\n\nMaintain the right speed for the conditions - not too fast so that you risk losing control, but not so slow that you risk losing momentum when you need it.\n\nWhy do schools close when it snows?\n\nImage copyright PA wire\n\nIf your school has declared a snow day, you've got your head teacher to thank.\n\nThey are usually the ones who decide whether to close the school.\n\nThe decision is based on the welfare of children, taking into account whether:\n\nchildren can get to and from school safely\n\nthe site is safe\n\nthere are enough staff to supervise the students.\n\nIf the weather is fine in the morning, but scheduled to get worse later in the day, the school may decide to close for the whole day.\n\nWhat actually is snow?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nMost people know it's white and cold and falls from the sky. But what actually is it?\n\nAs the Met Office explains, snow forms when tiny ice crystals in clouds stick together, becoming snowflakes.\n\nIf enough of these crystals stick together, they'll become heavy enough to fall to the ground.\n\nAs the snowflakes drift down from the sky, those falling through moist air that is slightly warmer than 0\u00b0C will melt at the edges and stick together, producing big flakes.\n\nThis type of snow is \"wet\" and makes for good snowmen.\n\n\"Dry snow\", which is ideal for snow sports, comes from snowflakes that fall through cold, dry air, producing small, powdery flakes."

    "text": "The live final of the series exploring the achievements of some of the greatest figures of the 20th century. The public vote for who they believe should be called the greatest.\n\nIn this live final hosted by Claudia Winkleman and Nick Robinson, the celebrity advocates return to fight their winning icon's case, and the public vote for the person they think was the greatest figure of the 20th century. Further information and debate can be found across the BBC to help viewers decide which of the seven finalists to vote for.\n\nDuring his illustrious broadcasting career, Sir Trevor McDonald has interviewed many of the top politicians of our time. He argues that 'the ultimate icon should be a political leader due to the commitment of their desire to be of service to their community, to their society, or to their nation'.\n\nDermot O'Leary believes that it is exploration that has had the most profound effect on the world around us and our place in it: 'Explorers have taken us on a journey from conquest to understanding. The work of explorers has changed how we see our world and ourselves'.\n\nChris Packham argues that a scientist should be crowned winner because 'whatever the century threw at us, scientists found a way to save the day. I want to celebrate their genius and show how, through great personal sacrifice, they were able to propel humanity forwards.'\n\nKathleen Turner wants an entertainer to win the public's vote: 'They may not be leaders - but they still led the way.' She argues that it is the audience that turn entertainers into stars, which makes them 'icons in the truest sense - because they already belong to us'.\n\nSanjeev Bhaskar is fighting for an activist to be the icon of the 20th century because 'they were trailblazers who gave dignity to the debased and helped move power from the few to the many'. These were people, he says, 'that at great personal cost inspired thousands, millions to do the same as them'.\n\nClare Balding thinks a sports star should be crowned the public's icon because 'sport (...) is a true meritocracy which rewards achievement without favour or judgement. There are a few individuals in the last century who made the most of their moment in the spotlight to change the world around them and they made a difference to millions of others.'\n\nLily Cole argues that an artist or writer deserves to be voted the winner: 'I believe good artists - whether film-makers, writers, painters or sculptors - push the boundaries of our culture, reflecting the times and also signposting new directions for society.'\n\nWho will the greatest icon be? Voting opens near the start of the programme and there will be two ways to cast your vote: by telephone (details are outlined during the final) or via the series website. The winner is announced at the end of the final."

    "authors": [
      "Alfie Shaw"
    ],
    "text": "The dangers of venoms are well documented, but these deadly toxins can also save lives.\n\nToxicologist Dr Zoltan Takacs says: \"Venom toxins are the only molecules on Earth explicitly selected by evolution to take a life in less than one minute\u201d. In 2015, David Warrell, tropical medicine specialist at Oxford University, estimated that 200,000 deaths a year were caused by snakebites.\n\nThe development of new antivenom is an ongoing struggle, however researchers have found that the toxins found in venoms can also aid in treating other medical conditions and several venom-based drugs are already in use. Here are four species whose venoms are being used to benefit humankind.\n\nSnakes\n\nCaptopril derived from the Jararaca pit viper snake's toxins, launched in 1981 \u00a9 M Moraes/Getty\n\nSnake venom is a term that covers a wide array of different venoms. Some kill quickly while others take time.\n\nMost snakes deliver their poison through fangs that operate in a similar method to a syringe. Once the fang has pierced their victims flesh, the poison is delivered through the tooth and directly into the prey\u2019s bloodstream. The exceptions to this are snakes who spit their venom, like the Mozambique spitting cobra (Naja mossambica).\n\nSince there is such a variety in the venoms, the potential medical applications differ from snake to snake. Coronary medical conditions are a field where solutions involving toxins taken from snakes are currently employed.\n\n\u201cSnake venoms served as templates for some of the top medicines used in high blood pressure, heart failure, and heart attack,\u201d explains Takacs.\n\n\u201cThe source of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor class of medicines, the Jararaca pit viper snake (Bothrops jararaca), arguably has saved more human lives than any other animal in the history of mankind.\u201d\n\nKomodo Dragons\n\nKomodo dragons are classified as a vulnerable species, so while their population is currently stable, conservation work will be needed to keep it that way \u00a9 Guenterguni/Getty\n\nThe venom gland of a Komodo dragon works differently to that of a snake. Instead of the snake\u2019s syringe-like action, Komodo dragons use an oozing method of delivery. Venom is squeezed out of multiple \u2018sacks\u2019 between the dragon\u2019s teeth when its jaw clamps down onto its prey. The venom mixes with the prey\u2019s blood and prevents it from clotting. This is why their prey continues to bleed out after the attack. While deadly to prey, the anticoagulante properties of this venom is key to its potential medical uses. These toxins have applications in treating strokes, heart attacks and pulmonary embolisms, all of which can stem from blood clots.\n\nScorpions\n\nThe venom from the Deathstalker scorpion is one of the most potent scorpion venoms. \u2019\u00a9 IMAGEMORE Co, Ltd./Getty\n\nOver 1.2 million people are stung by scorpions each year, resulting in around 3250 deaths according to a 2008 study. Aside from its terrifying name, the deathstalker scorpion (Leiurus quinquestriatus) could play an important role in treating cancer. The deathstalker\u2019s potent venom contains a toxin called Chlorotoxin which is being developed to diagnose cancers and in delivery systems for treating tumours.\n\nNorthern Short-Tailed Shrew\n\nSince the Northern Short-Tailed Shrew doesn\u2019t hibernate, it\u2019s population is drastically reduced during the winter months \u00a9 Jim Petranka/www.dpr.ncparks.gov\n\nVenoms are not normally found in mammals, and while this shrew\u2019s venom isn\u2019t strong enough to kill a human, it will cause pain and swellings.\n\nThis venomous shrew may have failed to grab the public imagination, but it has seized the interests of the scientific community. The reason: its venom is being explored for use in treating cancer.\n\nTakacs says this is possible because some tumor cells express a molecule that\u2019s structure closely resembles the natural target of the toxin.\n\n\u201cBy piggy-backing this resemblance, it plausible to turn a toxin into a therapeutic or diagnostic agent for cancer.\u201d\n\nBy Alfie Shaw\n\nFeatured image by Digital Vision/Getty"

    "title": "A high-carb diet may explain why Okinawans live so long",
    "authors": [
      "David Robson"
    ],
    "text": "The search for the \u201celixir of youth\u201d has spanned centuries and continents \u2013 but recently, the hunt has centred on the Okinawa Islands, which stretch across the East China Sea. Not only do the older inhabitants enjoy the longest life expectancy of anyone on Earth, but the vast majority of those years are lived in remarkably good health too.\n\nOf particular note is the number of people who reach 100 years of life. For every 100,000 inhabitants, Okinawa has 68 centenarians \u2013 more than three times the numbers found in US populations of the same size. Even by the standards of Japan, Okinawans are remarkable, with a 40% greater chance of living to 100 than other Japanese people.\n\nLittle wonder scientists have spent decades trying to uncover the secrets of the Okinawans\u2019 longevity \u2013 in both their genes and their lifestyle. And one of the most exciting factors to have recently caught the scientists\u2019 attention is the peculiarly high ratio of carbohydrates to protein in the Okinawan diet \u2013 with a particular abundance of sweet potato as the source of most of their calories.\n\n\u201cIt is quite the opposite of current popular diets that advocate a high protein, low carb diet,\u201d says Samantha Solon-Biet, who researches nutrition and ageing at the University of Sydney. Despite the popularity of the Atkins and Paleo diets, however, there is minimal evidence that high-protein diets really do bring about long-term benefits.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\n\nSo could the \u201cOkinawan Ratio\u201d \u2013 10:1 carbohydrate to protein \u2013 instead be the secret to a long and healthy life? Although it would still be far too early to suggest any lifestyle changes based on these observations, the very latest evidence \u2013 from human longitudinal studies and animal trials \u2013 suggest the hypothesis is worth serious attention. According to these findings, a low protein, high carbohydrate diet sets off various physiological responses that protect us from various age-related illnesses \u2013 including cancer, cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. And the Okinawan Ratio may achieve the optimal dietary balance to achieve those effects.\n\nMuch of this research comes from the Okinawa Centenarian Study (OCS), which has been investigating the health of the ageing population since 1975. The OCS examines inhabitants from across the Okinawa prefecture, which includes more than 150 islands. By 2016, the OCS had examined 1,000 centenarians from the region.\n\nRather than suffering a prolonged demise, the Okinawan centenarians appeared to have delayed many of the usual effects of ageing, with almost two thirds living independently until the age of 97. This remarkable \u201chealthspan\u201d was evident across many age-related diseases. The typical Okinawan centenarian appeared to be free of the typical signs of cardiovascular disease, without the build-up of the hard \u201ccalcified\u201d plaques around the arteries that can lead to heart failure. Okinawa\u2019s oldest residents also have far lower rates of cancer, diabetes and dementia than other ageing populations.\n\nGenetic jackpot\n\nGiven these results, there is little doubt that Okinawa has an exceptional population. But what can explain that extraordinary longevity?\n\nGenetic good fortune could be one important factor. Thanks to the geography of the islands, Okinawa\u2019s populations have spent large chunks of their history in relative isolation, which may has given them a unique genetic profile. Preliminary studies suggest this may include a reduced prevalence of a gene variant \u2013 APOE4 \u2013 that appears to increase the risk of heart disease and Alzheimer\u2019s. They may also be more likely to carry a protective variant of the FOXO3 gene involved in regulating metabolism and cell growth. This results in a shorter stature but also appears to reduce the risk of various age-related diseases, including cancer.\n\nEven so, it seems unlikely that good genes would fully explain the Okinawans\u2019 longevity, and lifestyle factors will also be important. The OCS has found that Okinawans are less likely to smoke than most populations, and since they worked predominantly in agriculture and fishing, they were also physically active. Their tight-knit communities also help the residents to maintain an active social life into old age. Social connection has also been shown to improve health and longevity by reducing the body\u2019s stress responses to challenging events. (Loneliness, in contrast, has been shown to be as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.)\n\nIt is the Okinawans\u2019 diet, however, that may have the most potential to change our views on healthy ageing. Unlike the rest of Asia, the Okinawan staple is not rice, but the sweet potato, first introduced in the early 17th Century through trade with the Netherlands. Okinawans also eat an abundance of green and yellow vegetables \u2013 such as the bitter melon \u2013 and various soy products. Although they do eat pork, fish and other meats, these are typically a small component of their overall consumption, which is mostly plant-based foods.\n\nThe traditional Okinawan diet is therefore dense in the essential vitamins and minerals - including anti-oxidants - but also low in calories. Particularly in the past, before fast food entered the islands, the average Okinawan ate around 11% fewer calories than the normal recommended consumption for a healthy adult.\n\nFor this reason, some scientists believe that Okinawans offer more evidence for the life-enhancing virtues of a \u201ccalorie restricted\u201d diet. Since the 1930s, some doctors and scientists have argued that continuously limiting the amount of energy you consume could have many benefits above and beyond weight loss \u2013 including a deceleration of the ageing process.\n\nIn one of the most compelling experiments, a group of resus macaques eating 30% fewer calories than the average monkey showed a remarkable 63% reduction in deaths from age-related diseases over a 20-year period. They also looked younger \u2013 they had fewer wrinkles and their fur retained its youthful lustre rather than turning grey. Due to practical difficulties, long-term clinical trials in humans have yet to be completed to test the effects on longevity, but a recent two-year experiment, funded by the US National Institute on Aging, was highly suggestive: participants on a calorie restricted diet showed better cardiovascular health \u2013 including lower blood pressure and cholesterol.\n\nIt\u2019s still not clear why a calorie restricted diet would be so beneficial, but there are many potential mechanisms. One possibility is that calorie restriction alters the cell\u2019s energy signalling, so that the body devotes more resources to preservation and maintenance \u2013 such as DNA repair \u2013 rather than growth and reproduction, while limiting \u2018oxidative stress\u2019 caused by the toxic by-products of metabolism that can cause cellular damage.\n\nThe benefits of the Okinawan Diet may not end with its calorie restriction.\n\nSolon-Biet has conducted a series of studies examining the influence of dietary composition (rather than sheer quantity) on ageing in animals, and her team has consistently found that a high-carb, low-protein diet extends the lifespan of various species, with her most recent study showing that it reduces some of the signs of ageing in the brain. Amazingly, they have found that the optimum ratio is 10 parts carb to one part protein \u2013 the same as the so-called Okinawan Ratio.\n\nAlthough there aren\u2019t yet any controlled clinical trials in humans, Solon-Biet cites epidemiological work across the world that all point to similar conclusions. \u201cOther long-lived populations have also been shown to have dietary patterns that include relatively low amounts of protein,\u201d she says. \u201cThese include the Kitavans, [who live on] a small island in Papua New Guinea, the South American Tsimane people and populations that consume the Mediterranean diet.\u201d\n\nOnce again, the exact mechanisms are murky. Like calorie restriction, the low protein diets seem to promote the cell repair and maintenance. Karen Ryan, a nutritional biologist at the University of California, Davis, points out that the scarcity of amino acids can encourage cells to recycle old material (rather than synthesising new proteins).\n\n\u201cTogether, these changes may prevent the ageing-associated accumulation of damaged proteins within cells,\u201d she says. This build-up of damaged proteins may usually be responsible for many diseases, she says \u2013 but the regular clean up when we eat a low-protein diet could prevent it.\n\nSo should we all start adopting the Okinawan Diet? Not quite. Ryan points to some evidence that low protein intake may limit bodily damage up to the age of 65, but you may then benefit from increasing your protein intake after that point. \u201cOptimal nutrition is expected to vary across the life history,\u201d she says. And it\u2019s also worth noting one study, which found that the relative merits of protein and carbohydrates may depend on the protein's source: a diet higher in plant-based protein appears to be better than a diet rich in meat or dairy, for instance. So the Okinawans may be living longer due to the fact that they are eating (mostly) fruit and vegetables, rather than its high carb, low protein content.\n\nUltimately, the Okinawans\u2019 health is probably due to a lucky confluence of many factors, Ryan says. \u201cAnd specific interactions among these factors will also be important.\u201d And we may need many more years of research to understand the importance of each of those ingredients before we finally come up with a true recipe for the \u201celixir of youth\u201d.\n\nDavid Robson is a senior journalist at BBC Future.

    "text": "It\u2019s like a culinary riddle: what is a food made of only three ingredients where the main processing is done by invisible workers; which can be eaten as an appetizer, condiment or dessert; and which is prescribed by doctors to cure ailments?\n\nNeed a hint? It\u2019s also a dairy product\u2026 that can be eaten by the lactose-intolerant.\n\nThe answer: Parmigiano-Reggiano.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 The end to a French cheese tradition?\n\n\u2022 Poland\u2019s surprisingly beautiful cheese\n\n\u2022 Lebanon\u2019s rare cheese made in jars\n\nMuch more than a fancy way to say \u201cparmesan\u201d, Parmigiano-Reggiano is a cheese that can only be made with extremely precise ingredients, in an extraordinarily particular process, in a 10,000-sq-km geographical area of Italy so carefully defined that you can make Parmigiano on one side of the small city of Bologna but not the other.\n\nThe result of all that labour and legality is \u2013 as many cooks, nutritionists and Italians alike will tell you \u2013 a practically perfect food.\n\nIt is a panacea \u2013 something that gives health to everything it touches\n\nThere is Parmigiano\u2019s taste: salty but sweet, grassy but nutty, sharp but rich. There\u2019s its texture: hard but grainy, popping with white crystals. There\u2019s its evolution as it ages: a two-year-old cheese smells like fresh fruit and tastes sharply sweet; a three-year-old wheel reminds you of dried grapes and nutmeg, tastes more savoury and complex, and crumbles more easily in the palm.\n\nAnd there is its nutrition, a result of not only its ingredients but of the ageing process. Pound for pound, Parmigiano can compete with almost any food for calcium, amino acids, protein, vitamin A. \u201cParmigiano has a thousand benefits, even for health,\u201d said chef Anna Maria Barbieri. \u201cIt is, let\u2019s say, a panacea. Something that gives health to everything it touches.\u201d\n\nI hope so, because at Barbieri\u2019s restaurant Antica Moka, a Michelin-listed restaurant in the heart of Parmigiano country in Modena, I eat the cheese until I feel like I\u2019m going to burst. From a 24-month wedge as long as my forearm, I use the spade-shaped slicer, almost as ubiquitous in Italian kitchens as Parmigiano itself, to slice off shards for antipasto. I feast from a small cup of farro soup drizzled with crema di parmigiana (parmesan cream) accompanied with Parmigiano bread. And then there\u2019s Parmigiano again as a primo (first main course), twice over: tortellini in a sauce of Parmigiano, drizzled with balsamic vinegar of Modena, served in a fried Parmigiano bowl.\n\n\u201cSometimes people tell me, \u2018But Parmigiano, you put it in everything!\u2019,\u201d Barbieri said with a chuckle. \u201cIt\u2019s my weakness. I really do put it everywhere.\u201d\n\nLike so many others in the production area, Barbieri grew up with Parmigiano. She remembers dairy farmers bringing their milk to her family\u2019s cheesemaking factory. As a little girl, she would accompany her grandfather, one of the first members of the Parmigiano-Reggiano Consortium, the association of producers established in 1934, on his trips to factories to verify the quality of each cheese wheel and give them their distinctive stamp of approval.\n\n\u201cFor those of us from Emilia-Romagna, Parmigiano is our \u2018daily bread\u2019,\u201d Barbieri said. \u201cIt accompanies us throughout our lives.\u201d\n\nIn Italy, particularly this part of Italy, Parmigiano is no mere luxury. It is a birthright. It\u2019s grated over countless bowls of soup and dishes of pasta. At aperitivi with friends, it\u2019s as crucial as a glass of wine. At weddings, it\u2019s as abundant as well wishes.\n\nA friend from Turin told me that when she came to the UK to study, she tucked three staples into her suitcase: olive oil, tomato passata and Parmigiano-Reggiano. When I went to see a Roman friend visiting London, I smiled to see a wedge of Parmigiano on the kitchen counter of her rented flat. In my own home with my Italian husband, our refrigerator always is stocked with milk, eggs \u2013 and Parmigiano.\n\nParmigiano\u2019s devotees are hardly new. The 14th-Century poet Boccaccio set his maccheroni (pasta) eaters on a mountain of the cheese. The 17th-Century painter Cristoforo Munari placed Parmigiano at the centre of his kitchen scenes. The Pope sent England\u2019s King Henry VIII 100 wheels as a gift. The French playwright Moli\u00e8re asked for Parmigiano on his deathbed. When the Great Fire of London bore down on the house of Samuel Pepys in 1666, the writer buried a wheel of the cheese to protect it.\n\nFew of these fans would recognise much of what\u2019s sold today. The white flakes many of us grew up shaking from a green can aren\u2019t parmesan, not even close. Within the EU, both Parmigiano-Reggiano and its anglicised version, \u201cparmesan\u201d, are legally registered terms protected by the PDO \u2013 protected designation of origin \u2013 label since 1996. But in the US, the law protects only the name \u201cParmigiano-Reggiano\u201d (In the EU, those green Kraft canisters are labelled \u201cParmasello\u201d).\n\nIn Italy, Parmigiano is no mere luxury \u2013 it is a birthright\n\nWorse, much of what goes for grated cheese in the US isn\u2019t cheese at all. Tests by Bloomberg News found that some versions included up to 9% wood pulp \u2013 an anti-clumping agent known as cellulose. Parmigiano-Reggiano doesn\u2019t have this ingredient or any additives or preservatives at all, for that matter, salt aside.\n\nThen there\u2019s fraud. At the headquarters of the Parmigiano-Reggiano Consortium in the city of Reggio Emilia, president Nicola Bertinelli, whose family has made Parmigiano at their farm since 1895, asked me to take a guess: out of 10 wheels of Parmigiano-Reggiano sold in the world, how many are real?\n\n\u201cOne?\u201d I guessed, expecting I\u2019d be too cynical.\n\n\u201cExactly. One,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter all, there\u2019s a great deal of money in Parmigiano. When the US\u2019s wholesale chain Costco sold wheels for $900, it made headlines \u2013 not least because it was a bargain.\n\nThe reason Parmigiano is so pricey lies in its precision.\n\nThere are only three ingredients: milk, salt and rennet, the enzyme that curdles milk. The milk comes from four cow breeds \u2013 the most famous of which are the vacche rosse, a rare breed of red cows that number just 3,000 total, or 0.01% of all of the dairy cows in the EU alone. But it\u2019s more than that. \u201cThe secret of this cheese isn\u2019t just the type of cow that produces the milk, but what the animals eat,\u201d said Luca Caramaschi, the owner of Parmigiano factory Caseificio San Bernardino.\n\nBertinelli outlines the rules. The production area is exclusively the provinces of Parma, Modena, Reggio Emilia, Mantua (to the east of the Po River) and Bologna (to the west of the Reno River).\n\nAt least 50% of the cows\u2019 dry food must come from hay, at least 75% of the hay must come from the Parmigiano production area, and at least 50% of that production-area hay must be produced on the farm where the cow itself was born and bred.\n\n\u201cWhy is this zone so precise? Because only here \u2013 naturally, historically, geographically \u2013 does the hay of the cattle have three specific strains of bacteria: the \u2018three friends\u2019,\u201d Bertinelli said. \u201cIf these three bacteria are present in production, they trigger processes where the milk leads to the development of particular aromas, flavours and tastes \u2013 and to specific acidity levels, which is why [the cheese] can be preserved for so long.\u201d\n\nWithout these \u201cfriends\u201d, even the finest of cheesemakers and vacche rosse wouldn\u2019t be able to produce Parmigiano.\n\nI watch the invisible workers in action at the Caseificio Sociale Cooperativo Pongennaro. Like 85% of Parmigiano factories, it\u2019s a cooperative, owned and run by groups of small local farmers. And at 08:00, production already is in full swing. Half of the milk was delivered fresh from the cows the previous evening; overnight, the fat rose to the surface. It\u2019s been skimmed off for butter. The rest of the milk was brought this morning, full-fat. Both are combined in a copper cauldron, the reason Parmigiano is called semi-grasso \u2013 \u201csemi-fat\u201d. It takes 14 litres of milk to make 1kg of Parmigiano; 550 litres to make one wheel.\n\nOne of the cheesemakers heats up the cauldron and adds the whey starter \u2013 the culture rich with good bacteria that kick-starts the fermentation process \u2013 from yesterday\u2019s production.\n\n\u201cNow a kind of battle takes place: the good bacteria will defeat the bad bacteria by eating everything,\u201d said the consortium\u2019s Cristiana Capelli, who is showing me around. \u201cThe good bacteria start looking for more food and begin to eat the lactose of the milk. The cheese is cleaned, safe for a long fermentation.\u201d This explains why the only preservative used, or needed, in Parmigiano is salt. It also explains why Parmigiano is safe even for the lactose-intolerant.\n\nAs we watch, one of the workers adds rennet to curdle the milk. After two minutes, the cheese begins to separate. In nine minutes, it\u2019s coagulated completely. The next step is churning, first slowly and carefully, then faster and faster. The temperature goes up to about 45C. One cheesemaker dips his hand into the cauldron. \u201cWatching the temperature is not enough,\u201d Capelli said. \u201cThey keep their hands inside because they have to find out how the milk is behaving. Milk is different every day depending on air, the temperature, everything.\u201d\n\nThe mix has turned from creamy white to butter-yellow; the granules look like rice pudding. The cheesemaker squeezes them to test their readiness. It\u2019s time. The heat switched off, the mixture is left to rest for an hour. The liquid, which weighs 10 times more than the granules, pushes out both air and bad bacteria.\n\nThen comes the moment we\u2019ve been waiting for. At the bottom of each cauldron, 2.1m deep, a 100kg block has formed. The men push it up with a paddle and cut it in half: two 50kg wheels of what looks like packed-together rice.\n\nThe next steps of the process sound like nothing so much as going to a spa. In the sala di riposo, or \u201cresting room\u201d, the cheese loses weight: put in a mould, the wheel rests under a weight to squeeze out excess water. It\u2019s stencilled with the stamp of origin, outlining the date, factory and DOP label. Then it goes to the pool: each cheese is plunged into a bath of water made up of 33% salt. Through osmosis, the cheese sheds fat and whey. After 20 days of brining, when the salt has penetrated 3cm or 4cm deep, it\u2019s left in the sun to dry.\n\nOnly then, finally, does the cheese go into the ageing room.\n\nHere, over the next two years, or three, or even 20, as in the case of one wheel that Caramaschi shows me at Caseificio San Bernardino, the magic happens. The salt penetrates the core of the cheese. The bacteria keep up their work. The cheese transforms from a block of milk and fat and salt to something else entirely: Parmigiano.\n\n\u201cOver time, all of the aromas and flavours that there are from the territory are concentrated,\u201d said Caramaschi. \u201cIt\u2019s much like what happens with wine.\u201d\n\nIn a year, professional testers from the consortium come to check each wheel, tapping it with a hammer-like tool and listening for evidence of inconsistencies, like cracks or holes. If it\u2019s approved, it gets a final firebrand of quality. If not, it\u2019s either judged a second-quality cheese, which must be labelled mezzano \u2013 middle quality \u2013 and can\u2019t be aged further. Or, if beyond hope, the rind and its stamps are scraped off completely, erasing forever any association with Parmigiano.\n\nSome 8% of all the wheels produced in the region meet one of these lesser fates. The rest go on to be exported across Italy and around the world.\n\n*\n\nA little later, I find myself standing in an 800-year-old chapel on Caramaschi\u2019s estate. A painting above me shows the archangel Gabriel carrying a banner \u2013 not out of the ordinary, except for what\u2019s depicted on it: San Lucio, the patron saint of cheesemakers, stirring a copper kettle of milk over a fire to make Parmigiano.\n\n\u201cThis is where I was married 30 years ago, where my sons were married, where my nephew and my sons were baptised, and where my father lies,\u201d Caramaschi said. \u201cIt\u2019s become the church of the family.\u201d\n\nBefore Caramaschi\u2019s great-great-great-grandfather began making Parmigiano here in the 1700s, this was a small village, complete with a dairy farm. The church is no coincidence. Parmigiano was first made under the guidance of Benedictine monks about a millennium ago.\n\nWithout knowing what bacteria were, cheesemaking must have seemed mystical, even miraculous, to its first practitioners. So, too, the food\u2019s health benefits.\n\nTraditionally, mothers gave rinds of Parmigiano to their teething babies. Even today, it\u2019s prescribed in Italy to the old, the young, the sick. Because the good bacteria gobble up the cheese\u2019s lactose, 26-month-old Parmigiano is safe for the lactose-intolerant. Thanks to that same breakdown of bonds, it\u2019s also easier to digest, its proteins and nutrients are easier to absorb.\n\n\u201cMeat proteins need to be broken down into amino acids, which takes four hours for beef,\u201d Bertinelli explained. \u201cBut thanks to the natural process of Parmigiano, they\u2019re already broken down, so it only takes 45 minutes.\u201d That means Parmigiano is ideal for those who need an immediate infusion of proteins, like athletes. Parmigiano also has nine free amino acids, the kind easily absorbed by the body \u2013 one of which, tyrosine, shows up in the white, umami-flavoured crystals that develop.\n\nParmigiano is a veritable nutritional supplement, capable of providing a high amount of vitamins and proteins in a few grams\n\nThen there are the nutrients. A single ounce (28g) of Parmigiano has 9g of protein, 2g more than beef, and 321mg of calcium, nearly 10 times more than milk. It has 12mg of magnesium (more than salmon), 28mg of potassium (about a third as much as banana) and 0.12mg of vitamin A (nearly as much as the same amount of raw carrots). There\u2019s zinc and iron, copper and manganese, biotin and vitamin B6.\n\n\u201cParmigiano is a veritable nutritional supplement, capable of providing a high amount of vitamins and proteins in a few grams,\u201d said Florence-based nutritionist Valentina Fratoni. She recommends it to children, to weight lifters, even to those expecting.\n\n\u201cEven pregnant women should eat Parmigiano as an important source of calcium for the health of their bones and for the formation of the skeleton of the unborn child,\u201d Fratoni said. \u201cAlthough Parmigiano is made with raw milk, therefore not pasteurised, its long maturing, at least 12 months, prevents any danger.\u201d\n\n*\n\nI end my exploration of Parmigiano much where I began: eating. I\u2019m back home in London, far from the glossy red cows and copper cauldrons and 800-year-old churches of Parmigiano country. As I pull out a wedge, I remember what Barbieri said.\n\n\u201cAt 24 months, I like to eat it like it is,\u201d she told me. \u201cWith hot bread out of the oven. Or even with nothing \u2013 then you can really get a feel for it and its flavour, so delicious you can taste it even with your eyes closed.\u201d\n\nIs Parmigiano a perfect food? I\u2019m not sure. But right now, standing barefoot on a chilly London evening, it\u2019s a taste of the things I love about Italy: its beautiful countryside and culinary passions, long traditions and little miracles. And for me, that\u2019s enough.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

It couldn't be operated on because of a risk of blindness and other \"catastrophic\" complications.\n\n\"The machine is intimidating because of its size,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a bit nerve-wracking but this is a better choice than chemo because it's more effective.\n\n\"Because of my age, [doctors] thought radiation would be a better choice.\"\n\nWhat is proton-beam therapy ?\n\nPatients have been able to travel overseas for NHS funded treatment since 2008. But some haven't been able to travel because they are too ill or their treatment need was too urgent.\n\nThe travel also caused major upheaval to families at a very stressful time.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What is proton-beam therapy?\n\nThe Christie hospital centre opened in autumn 2018. The first patient to have PBT there, who is still undergoing treatment, did not want publicity.\n\nA second health service PBT centre is also set to open in the UK, at London's University College Hospital, offering the therapy from 2020.\n\nIt is hoped that each will each treat up to 750 patients every year.\n\nThe Clatterbridge Cancer Centre in Merseyside has been delivering low-energy proton therapy specifically for NHS patients with eye tumours.\n\nBut the two new centres will be the first to deliver higher doses to a broader range of cancers - including brain, head and neck cancers and sarcoma, a rare cancer of soft tissue.\n\nBoth will carry out research to assess PBT's suitability for treating other cancers.\n\nProton-beam therapy made headlines around the world in 2014, when the parents of five-year-old Ashya King were arrested after taking him abroad for the treatment in Prague.\n\nOncologist Gillian Whitfield is leading Mason's care. She said his was a low grade (slow growing) tumour with a \"high chance of cure\".\n\n\"For Mason, in comparison to conventional radiotherapy, PBT should carry a lower risk of some important long-term side-effects of treatment - particularly effects on short-term memory and learning ability - and the risk over the next eight decades of the radiation causing other tumours.\n\n\"This is particularly important for children and teenagers with curable tumours, who will survive decades after treatment and are at much greater risk of serious long-term effects of treatment than adults.\"\n\nMason, who lives with his mother, step-father, and four siblings, and is in the middle of preparing for his GCSEs, will have 28 treatment sessions taking place Monday to Friday for almost six weeks.\n\nHe has had a specially made radiotherapy mask created to keep his head perfectly still during the therapy. And while he may get short-term side effects such as vomiting and headaches, long-term side-effects are rare.\n\nAnd he said his experiences as a patient had influenced his future career plans.\n\n\"I'm so grateful to all the doctors involved in my care and I'd love to do what they do one day - it will be my way of giving something back.\""

      "Alfie Shaw"
    ],
    "text": "Keepers must trick her into thinking she had only one baby\n\nWhen a mother panda gives birth to twins at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, the team uses a little sleight of hand to keep both cubs alive.\n\nShortly after birth, keepers remove one of the cubs, tricking the mother into thinking she only has one baby. The twins are then switched up to 10 times a day to maintain the single baby panda illusion. One of the cubs is with the mother almost all the time while the other is kept in an incubator and fed on formula milk.\n\nWhen having multiple cubs, pandas will usually only care for one baby and abandon the other, but switching them around might be the key for both twins' survival.\n\nHalf of all panda births result in twins, however, it is very rare for both cubs to survive as giant pandas almost always abandon a cub if they give birth to more than one. The reason is that they don\u2019t have sufficient milk or energy to care for two so focus their attentions on the strongest club. Rearing a cub is difficult for pandas as they subsist on bamboo, which has a low nutritional value and mothers need to balance their own survival with that of the cub.\n\nNewly born Giant Panda cub in the incubator at Chengdu Research Base \u00a9 BBC Earth Unplugged\n\nThe process of coxing the panda to give up her young requires great patience from the keepers. They use a bowl of honey water to placate the mother, while they attempt to remove the child. Not wishing to distress the panda, this negotiation has to be repeated until the panda trusts the keeper enough to let them handle her cub.\n\nThis method opens up the possibility of a 100% survival rate in captive panda cubs.

    "text": "The interconnectedness of Europe has a long history, as we\u2019re reminded when we explore the roots of the English language \u2013 roots that stretch back to the 5th Century. Anglo-Saxon England \u201cwas connected to the world beyond its shores through a lively exchange of books, goods, ideas,\u201d argues the Medieval historian Mary Wellesley, describing a new exhibition at the British Library in London \u2013 Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms: Art, Word, War \u2013 that charts the genesis of England.\n\n\u201cSomething like 80% of all surviving Old English verse survives in four physical books\u2026 for the first time in recorded history they are all together [in this exhibition],\u201d she tells BBC Culture. \u201cThe period that is represented by Old English is about 600 years, which is like between us and back to Chaucer\u2026 imagine if there were only four physical books that survived from that period, what would that say about our literature?\u201d\n\nWhat we understand as English has its roots in 5th-Century Germany and Denmark, from where the Anglian, Saxon and Jute tribes came. As the Roman legions withdrew around 410AD, so the Saxon war bands (what Rome called \u2018the barbarians\u2019) landed and an era of migration from the Continent and the formation of Anglo-Saxon England began. The word \u201cEnglish\u201d derives from the homeland of the Angles, the Anglian peninsula in Germany. Early English was written in runes, combinations of vertical and diagonal lines that lent themselves to being carved into wood and were used by other closely related Germanic languages, such as Old Norse, Old Saxon and Old High German.\n\n\u201cThe earliest fragments of the English language are likely to be a group of runic inscriptions on three 5th-Century cremation urns from Spong Hill in Norfolk,\u201d Wellesley has written. \u201cThe inscriptions simply read alu, which probably means \u2018ale\u2019. Perhaps the early speakers of Old English longed for ale in death as well as life.\u201d\n\nThe exhibition gathers together an array of documents, books and archaeological evidence to form a dense picture of the Anglo-Saxon period, including a burial urn with runic inscriptions in early English from Loveden Hill, Lincolnshire, England.\n\nAnglo-Saxons cremated their dead and interred their remains in earthenware vessels. About 20 objects with runic inscriptions from before 650AD are known from England, making this vessel \u2013 which seems to feature a woman\u2019s name and the word for tomb \u2013 one of the earliest examples of English.\n\nThe exhibition also includes a charming 11th-Century English map of the world, which gives us an insight into Anglo-Saxon identity. Britain and Ireland are squeezed into the bottom left-hand corner. (The two main population centres in England, London and Winchester, are noted.) The Mediterranean Sea is at the centre of the world\u2019s land mass, with Rome prominent near the bottom on the left (\u2018Ro\u2019 and then \u2018ma\u2019, with towers in between); across the water, Jerusalem is also prominent. Africa looms large on the upper right (follow the orange line up from the Nile delta), and India is the roughly triangular mass at the top centre.\n\nThis worldview was inherited from the Romans, who regarded Britain as being on the far edge of the world, but remained tied to the \u2018centre\u2019 by the Christian religion. Throughout the Anglo-Saxon era, which ended with the Norman Conquest in 1066, there was religious (and with it, intellectual) traffic across Europe.\n\nVenerable Bede, an English monk and historian, noted in the early 8th Century that Britain was inhabited by four peoples who used five languages: the Picts (who remain shadowy); the Scots (whose language became Gaelic); the Britons (whose language became Welsh, Cornish, and Breton); and the Anglo-Saxons (who used a form of English). The fifth language was the Latin of the church, which eventually provided an alphabet to replace runes. On top of all of this, the Viking invasion of Britain began in the early 8th Century, adding Danish culture to the mix.\n\nIt is important to remember that the formation of English was influenced by a huge range of ethnic and geographical forces. The emerging \u2018England\u2019 of this period was a melting pot.\n\nFor example, we owe our English names for the days of the week, Tuesday to Friday, to the pagan religion that the Anglo-Saxons brought with them to Britain (Saturday, Sunday and Monday derive from the Greco-Roman tradition). Equally, the name of the Christian festival Easter is linked by Bede to \u2018Eostre\u2019, who seems to have been a pagan goddess. Woden, the most important pagan god, to whom we owe the word Wednesday, was also claimed as the ancestor of Anglo-Saxon royal lines. (The similarity to the name of the Norse god Odin is no accident.)\n\nEven Alfred the Great, an extremely pious Christian, claimed to be a descendant of Woden. The image here is a copy from a 12th-Century manuscript; it shows Woden at the centre of the kingly lines of (clockwise from top right) Wessex, Bernicia, Deira, Mercia and Kent.\n\nOne of Alfred\u2019s personal projects was to translate great Latin prose works into Old English vernacular, thereby making them more accessible\n\nAnother object in the exhibition is something of a mystery. Made of gold, rock crystal and enamel, it dates from the late 9th Century, and the inscription around the outer edge says \u201cAlfred ordered me to be made\u201d; from the context, scholars have concluded that this refers to Alfred the Great.\n\nWhat is known as the Alfred Jewel contains an empty socket, suggesting it could have been designed as a reading pointer, or \u00e6stel. If so, this object, and others like it, indicate the importance of literacy under Alfred\u2019s reign \u2013 and especially literacy in English, which Alfred knew he needed to promote to help constitute a \u2018united kingdom\u2019 of England.\n\n\u201cKing Alfred was very educated and clearly loved reading,\u201d says Wellesley. \u201c[He felt] there had been a terrible decline in learning in England, and in the more peaceful final four years of his reign he instituted a programme to promote the vernacular. It\u2019s a wily political move, because he\u2019s the first king to use the phrase \u2018king of the English\u2019.\u201d In the Anglo-Saxon period, English was \u201cvery much a vernacular, a lesser language; not the language of the educated elite\u201d \u2013 which was Latin.\n\nAccording to Wellesley, Alfred had translations made of books that were \u201c\u2018most needful for men to know\u2019; these include Gregory the Great\u2019s Pastoral Care, Augustine\u2019s Soliloquies, Boethius\u2019s Consolations of Philosophy and others\u201d. She argues that \u201che juxtaposes the concepts of wealth and wisdom\u2026 he is also [with \u00e6stels like the Alfred Jewel] kind of bribing the bishops to whom he sends these works\u201d.\n\nThe most famous Anglo-Saxon literary text is also included in the exhibition. Set in Scandinavia, Beowulf concerns a hero\u2019s epic encounters with, and slaying of, monsters such as the man-thing Grendel and a dragon.\n\nThe copy we have (the only existing manuscript of Beowulf), which was scorched by fire in the 18th Century, is thought to date from around the end of the 10th Century. Yet the tale was probably much older than that and likely existed as part of an oral tradition of story-telling.\n\nThe manuscript was included in a larger collection that attests to the fascination of the period with remote places and exotic monsters. A lurid 11th-Century manuscript commonly called \u201cMarvels of the East\u201d (a page of which is reproduced here) catalogues (in both Latin and English) weird creatures purportedly found in the \u2018Far East\u2019.\n\nThese include people with lions\u2019 manes who sweat blood and people with legs 12ft (3.6m) long who capture and eat anyone passing. The manuscript of Beowulf, meanwhile, describes Grendel crunching on the bones of warriors. It\u2019s literature that offers visually arresting images to readers more used to hearing stories being told.\n\nThe Sutton Hoo belt buckle, from an early 7th-Century burial mound in Suffolk, England, is primarily made of gold and weighs over 400g (14oz), but beyond the bling, its intricacy speaks to the surprising sophistication of early Anglo-Saxon culture \u2013 and how that fed into the development of the English language.\n\nThe surface is covered in the zoomorphic interlace which can be seen elsewhere in designs of the period, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels (also in the British Library collection): apparently it is possible to puzzle out 13 snakes, birds and beasts of various sorts tangled together in the web.\n\nIn 920, Ordlaf, a regional official in Wiltshire, England, wrote to King Edward the Elder. This, the Fonthill Letter, is the earliest surviving letter in the English language. (Edward the Elder, son of Alfred the Great, was thought to have been \u201cglorious in the power of his rule\u201d. He was neglected by historians until recently and is now thought to be one of England\u2019s great kings.)\n\nThe letter is about what is in essence a convoluted legal dispute. Like many of the most important documents of this period, it survived for centuries through a combination of accident and neglect: it ended up in the archives of the Cathedral Church at Canterbury, where in the 12th Century it was marked \u201cuseless\u201d but none-the-less kept. Despite its designated uselessness, the Fonthill Letter gives us a precious glimpse of everyday Anglo-Saxon red tape, as well as the high level of literacy in English which Alfred promoted.\n\nThe Ruthwell Cross is an 8th- or early 9th-Century sandstone monument around 16ft 4in (5m) tall which now stands inside the church at Ruthwell, Dumfriesshire, Scotland. It would once have been in the churchyard. (A replica of it appears in the exhibition.)\n\nFrom bottom to top, the front of the cross represents the Crucifixion; the Annunciation; Christ curing a blind man; Mary Magdalene drying Christ\u2019s feet; and Mary and Martha. On the other side are depicted the Flight into Egypt; the hermits Paul and Antony; Christ recognised by beasts; and John the Baptist. The narrow sides have elegant vine-scroll ornamentation, around which is an unusual runic inscription of Old English verses that seem to echo and probably draw on the oral tradition of The Dream of the Rood (a \u2018dream vision\u2019 of the Cross), an Old English poetic masterpiece that survives in one place, as part of the Vercelli Book from the 10th Century.\n\nThe first word, starting with the big \u2018h\u2019, is hw\u00e6t, or \u2018Listen!\u2019. (Runic \u2018w\u2019 looks like a \u2018p\u2019.) Since the English runes would have been unintelligible to the indigenous British population of the area, it has been speculated that the cross was a creation of an English monastic community.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxons seem remote \u2013 they are remote, for at their furthest they are over 1,500 years away from us \u2013 and we will probably never fathom many of the details of their lives, but there are also moments where they leap into focus and feel like they might be our grandparents, squabbling about this or that or telling stories in a letter. So much is both alien and familiar. It is fascinating to witness the evolution of the written language; and to imagine our descendants puzzling over our use of it in an exhibition 1,500 years from now.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "title": "Are we born good or evil? (naughty or nice)",
    "authors": [
      "Tom Aglietti"
    ],
    "text": "Are we born with an innate moral compass or is it something we develop as we grow?\n\nWhether humans are born good or evil has been debated by philosophers for centuries. Aristotle argued that morality is learned, and that we\u2019re born as \u201camoral creatures\u201d while Sigmund Freud considered new-borns a moral blank slate. Anyone who has read \u201cLord of the Flies\u201d will expect children to be fully-fledged sociopaths just waiting to be freed from their adult-imposed shackles to (spoiler alert) start a cult and brutally attempt to kill each other.\n\nMaybe the two most famous opposing views on this debate are those of Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Hobbes describes humans as \u2018nasty\u2019 and \u2018brutish\u2019, needing society and rules to reign in their instincts in order to thrive; later Rousseau openly criticised him, arguing instead that man would be gentle and pure without the corruption of greed and inequality caused by the class system imposed by our society.\n\nRecent developmental psychology studies show there may be some natural \u201cgood\u201d in humanity (or, to be more technical, that at least kids are capable of passing moral judgements at an earlier age than previously thought).\n\nOne of the studies shown on \u2018Babies: Their Wonderful World\u201d was conducted to demonstrate if and at what age toddlers showed a preference towards \u201cgood\u201d behaviour.\n\nTo do this, babies less than a year old were made to watch a puppet show where different coloured shapes acted in ways that were clearly recognisable as morally right or wrong. A red circle is shown struggling to climb a hill while an \u201cevil\u201d blue square tries to push it back down. Meanwhile, \u201cgood\u201d yellow triangle attempts to help the red circle by pushing it up.\n\nAfter the play, the babies were asked which shape they wanted to play with: evil blue square or good yellow triangle. As you may have guessed, they all picked the latter, the triangle that exhibited \u2018helpful\u2019 and \u2018selfless\u2019 behaviour. This applied even for babies as young as seven months.\n\nThe scene replicates the findings of a 2010 study from the Infant Cognition Center at Yale University, which went further to prove that babies were choosing the puppets because of their actions rather than other variables (for example, an innate preference or familiarity with a certain colour or shape). When the show was replayed with the shapes taking on the opposite role, the infants still mostly chose the shape that had taken on the role of the \u2018helper\u2019.\n\nPeople have long debated if we are born bad and 'civilised' by society - or the reverse \u00a9 blackred/Getty\n\nA 2017 study from Kyoto University had a similar approach and findings to the puppet study, seemingly confirming these results. Children as young as six months were shown videos featuring three Pacman-like characters, called \u2018agents\u2019: a \u2018victim\u2019, a \u2018bully\u2019 bumping aggressively against the victim and squashing it into a wall, and a \u2018third party\u2019 agent. The third-party agent would sometimes intervene to help the victim by putting itself between the victim and the bully, and would sometimes flee instead. After watching the video, children had to choose their preferred character and most chose the intervening third-party agent who had tried to help the victim.\n\nOther studies have also shown babies exhibit altruistic behaviour, like the \u2018Big Mother Study\u2019 from Harvard, where infants who didn\u2019t know they were being observed still acted kind and were helpful to others, suggesting that this isn\u2019t just a learned behaviour to avoid punishment or scrutiny.\n\nWhile these studies can\u2019t completely disprove Freud and Hobbes\u2019 more pessimistic views on human nature, they do seem to suggest that babies are naturally inclined to prefer altruistic behaviour and that parents can be fairly confident that, while leaving their children on a desert island is probably still not the best idea, they at least won\u2019t try to squash the weakest one with a rock (sorry, William Golding).\n\nBy Tom Aglietti\n\nFeatured image by Image Source/Getty"

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Left-right: Directors Lynne Ramsay, Chloe Zhao and Marielle Heller\n\nThe Oscar nominations were announced on Tuesday, and there was a strong showing for films with women in lead roles.\n\nBoth of this year's most-nominated films - Roma and The Favourite - have female leads.\n\nBut it was a different story in the best director category, where all the nominees were men.\n\n\"It was an anticipated takeaway from this year's Oscar nominations announcement, but that doesn't make it any less unfortunate,\" wrote Kristopher Tapley in Variety.\n\nThe lack of women nominated for best director is \"immensely disappointing\", Liz Tucker, chair of Women in Film and Television UK, tells BBC News.\n\n\"It just shows how much work we still have to do, and it's heartbreaking really that some extraordinary work has been overlooked yet again by the Academy.\"\n\nIn the 91-year history of the Academy Awards, only five women have ever been nominated for best director.\n\nImage copyright 20th Century Fox Image caption Can You Ever Forgive Me? picked up acting nods for its two stars, but no directing nomination\n\nAfter this year's nominations, some argued that female directors should be recognised - but only on merit, rather than for the sake of balance.\n\n\"Can we stop focusing on gender and focus on talent instead?\" replied one Twitter user on Tuesday after the United Nations Women group drew attention to the disparity.\n\n\"To include a woman just to fill a female quota is sexist and an insult to all women. So what if there were only men nominated? Their movies were simply better; that's it. Stop interpreting everything as sexist/racist.\"\n\nBut Tucker argues: \"It seems difficult to believe that, on merit, only five women have ever been in that best director category.\n\n\"We're not asking for special favours here... One's not disputing the [best picture nominees] are all great films, but are they the best films?\n\n\"My favourite film of the year was Can You Ever Forgive Me?, and I'm not saying that because it's got a female director. I only discovered that after I watched it.\"\n\nSo why do so few women get nominated in the best director category?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Ava DuVernay had the top-grossing film directed by a woman in 2018\n\nIn Variety, Tapley suggested films directed by women don't get the same promotional push from studios during awards season.\n\nTucker adds: \"How people get nominated is a deeply political process, the amount of money behind campaigns... and it can still be a bit of an old boys' network.\"\n\nAnd there is the fact that so few films are directed by women in the first place.\n\nJust four of the top 100 films at the US box office last year had female directors - A Wrinkle In Time (Ava DuVernay), The Spy Who Dumped Me (Susanna Fogel), I Feel Pretty (Abby Kohn) and Blockers (Kay Cannon).\n\nThat's fewer than in 2017, when women directed 8% of the top 100 films.\n\n\"I think there's still a sense that women are a safe pair of hands, but if you want to get that glittery stardust, you need to go to a male director,\" Tucker says.\n\nFive female directors who could have made the Oscars shortlist\n\nBy Neil Smith, entertainment reporter\n\n1. Debra Granik (Leave No Trace)\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Debra Granik (right) with Thomasin McKenzie\n\nPreviously nominated for co-writing the screenplay for her 2010 feature Winter's Bone, Granik could potentially have been recognised again for Leave No Trace.\n\nThe film, about an Iraq war veteran (Ben Foster) determined to live \"off the grid\" with his teenage daughter (Thomasin McKenzie), proved popular with critics and currently has a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nGranik did not want for high-profile supporters either. Jane Campion, one of only five women to ever be nominated for the best director Oscar, said last month that \"she should be part of the best director Oscar conversation\".\n\nTraditionally, though, titles that launch at the Sundance Film Festival - as Leave No Trace did a year ago - tend to be forgotten by Academy members by the time they come to fill out their ballots.\n\n2. Marielle Heller (Can You Ever Forgive Me?)\n\nImage copyright Fox Searchlight Image caption Marielle Heller (left) with Melissa McCarthy\n\nAnother woman who would not have looked out of place on this year's best director shortlist is Heller, the driving force behind darkly comic forgery drama Can You Ever Forgive Me?\n\nThe 39-year-old Californian and former actress made an eye-catching directorial debut in 2015 with coming-of-age drama The Diary of a Teenage Girl.\n\nCan You Ever Forgive Me?, her second feature, has three nominations in all - one for adapted screenplay, in which Heller did not have a hand, and another two for stars Melissa McCarthy and Richard E Grant.\n\nYet Heller is unlikely to be ignored by the Academy for long. Her next film, a biopic of children's TV host Fred Rogers starring two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks, is already shaping up to be one of 2020's leading awards contenders.\n\n3. Lynne Ramsay (You Were Never Really Here)\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Lynne Ramsay with Joaquin Phoenix\n\nScottish film-maker Ramsay is up for a Bafta next month for You Were Never Really Here, a grim and violent thriller about another war veteran, played by Joaquin Phoenix, who tracks down missing girls.\n\nShe is also in line for a best director prize at the Independent Spirit Awards, where her competition includes another two women - Tamara Jenkins and the aforementioned Debra Granik.\n\nAs accomplished as You Were Never Really Here is, however, it may have simply proved too dark for Oscar voters.\n\nThe film was Ramsay's first project since Jane Got a Gun, a western starring Natalie Portman which she walked away from a day before shooting started.\n\n4) Josie Rourke (Mary Queen of Scots)\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Josie Rourke (left) with Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie\n\nWith two leading ladies boasting four past Oscar nominations between them, lavish production values and a pair of iconic queens at its centre, Mary Queen of Scots seemed to be destined for multiple Oscar nominations.\n\nYet its only citations are in the costume design and make-up and hairstyling categories, with Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie both left out of the actress and supporting actress line-ups.\n\nGiven Mary Queen of Scots is Josie Rourke's film directing debut, it would have perhaps been optimistic to expect her to get a best director nomination right out of the gate.\n\nAs The Favourite's 10 nominations show, though, Academy members are partial to heightened royal melodrama - something that might have worked more in Rourke's favour had she had the genre to herself this year.\n\n5) Chloe Zhao (The Rider)\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Chloe Zhao (right) with Brady Jandreau, star of The Rider\n\nAn outside bet for a best director nomination might have been 36-year-old Zhao, whose second feature The Rider has been quietly winning admirers since it made its debut at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe film arrived in US cinemas in April and went on to win best feature at the Gotham Independent Film Awards, one of the first ceremonies of the awards \"season\".\n\nBeautifully photographed and boldly impressionistic, The Rider tells of a young cowboy, played by real-life rodeo rider Brady Jandreau, struggling to recover from a serious brain injury.\n\nZhao might have not landed an Oscar nod, but she shouldn't be too down-hearted. Her next project is The Eternals, a superhero ensemble adventure for Marvel Studios.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

    "title": "The surprising origin of Argentina\u2019s brazen pastry names",
    "authors": [
      "Rebecca Treon"
    ],
    "text": "The first time I visited a pastry shop in Buenos Aires, I thought my ears were deceiving me. All around me, porte\u00f1os (Buenos Aires natives) were ordering their favourite pastries to accompany their morning coffee. But I couldn\u2019t believe what they were requesting: did that person just order six friar\u2019s balls? Along with half a dozen little cannons?\n\nThe sugar-topped fritters known as bolas de fraile (friar\u2019s balls) and the puff-pastry cones filled with dulce de leche called ca\u00f1oncitos (little cannons) are just two examples of Argentina\u2019s oddly named facturas (pastries). There are also bombas (bombs), similar to profiteroles, and libritos (little books), folded pastry layers that resemble pamphlets.\n\nWhile the pastries themselves are certainly sweet, the origin of their names is more sinister: in the late 1800s, a union of anarchist bakers used their pastries as propaganda.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 The slang that transformed Spanish\n\n\u2022 The dessert that\u2019s blocked at borders\n\n\u2022 The cake cooked on a spit\n\n\u201cThe majority of Argentines don\u2019t really know the significance of the pastry names, and why they\u2019re called what they are. They think they\u2019re just quirky, tongue-in-cheek nicknames,\u201d said Vicente Campana, pastry chef and professor at the National University of Entre Rios. \u201cBut really, it was the anarchists \u2013 who were anti-government, anti-police and anti-church \u2013 who gave them those names to draw attention to their political leanings.\u201d\n\nBlasphemy and gastronomy have long gone hand in hand\n\nBlasphemy and gastronomy have long gone hand in hand. Legend has it that in the early 16th Century during the Ottoman attack on Vienna, Austrians created a crescent-shaped puff pastry, similar to a croissant, in reference to the crescent moon and star that are a widely recognised symbol of Islam. Austrians would eat these crescents in front of Turkish soldiers as a way to blaspheme their occupiers. Centuries later when the European pastries made their way to South America; known today in Argentina as medialunas, the pastries are topped with a sticky layer of saccharine syrup.\n\nEven the term \u2018facturas\u2019 is loaded. The Latin root of the word is facere, meaning to make or create, but the modern-day Spanish noun means \u2018invoice\u2019. The use of the word \u2018facturas\u2019 to refer to all pastries (which is unique to Argentine Spanish) was a clever way for members of the baker\u2019s union to subversively call attention to the value of their labour.\n\nAs I sat dunking my medialuna into my caf\u00e9 con leche, customers crowded the counter. As quickly as display cases were emptied, new batches of pastries emerged, and each time the kitchen door opened, the clatter of pots and pans flooded the dining room. I can\u2019t imagine bakeries in the 19th Century were much different, but back then, bakers were just some of the country\u2019s working-class citizens who felt underappreciated.\n\nAfter declaring independence from Spain in 1816, Argentina\u2019s political scene was turbulent: civil war waged between centralist and federalists, and threats of invasion by foreign powers were frequent. In 1853, after 37 long years of disorder, the country adopted its first constitution. The relative peace that ensued allowed Buenos Aires to grow exponentially, becoming a worldwide hub of business.\n\nHowever, resentment of the government was growing among the lower and middle class. The new constitution had done little to prevent electoral fraud, and many citizens viewed their leaders as corrupt. Meanwhile, inflation posed a serious threat to the country\u2019s economy and workers\u2019 livelihoods.\n\nSimultaneously, anarchist and communist schools of thought were spreading across Europe, with growing demands for the rights of workers.\n\nThroughout the mid- to late 19th Century, Buenos Aires welcomed large numbers of European immigrants, predominantly from Spain and Italy, who were looking for a chance at a new life. They brought with them ideas for a society free from sovereign, military or religious rule \u2013 one in which everyone was treated equally.\n\nOne such anarchist was Italian exile Errico Malatesta, whose anti-government actions included writing socialist publications and organising anarchist rallies. After his revolutionary escapades led him to a prison sentence, he fled the continent by hiding in a shipping box containing a sewing machine that was bound for South America.\n\nArriving in Buenos Aires in 1885, he quickly fell in with other European anarchists, including fellow Italian Ettore Mattei, who had recently formed a trade union for the city\u2019s bakers \u2013 for what societal role could be more important than that of the people who provide the city with its daily bread?\n\nTwo years later, in 1887, the Sociedad Cosmopolita de Resistencia y Colocaci\u00f3n de Obreros Panaderos (The Cosmopolitan Society of Resistance and Placement of Bakery Workers) went on strike, closing down the city\u2019s bakeries for more than a week. As a part of the movement, union members renamed baked goods with blasphemous monikers targeting the government, the military and the church \u2013 the institutions anarchists believed stood in the way of individual freedom. What better way to elevate awareness of a cause than by changing the names of something residents eat on a daily basis?\n\nThe coming years brought rolling work stoppages across a variety of industries, from carpentry to mechanics to shoemakers, with Malatesta standing at the forefront of the movement. He left Buenos Aires in 1889, but his legacy of inspiring workers to stand up for their rights was long lasting, with the anarchist movement thriving in Argentina throughout most of the 20th Century.\n\nToday, in glass cases in bakeries across the country, dulce de leche-filled suspiras de monja (nun\u2019s sighs) sit beside vigilantes (vigilantes), straight pastries meant to look like police batons. You can call the pastries cream puffs, profiteroles or croissants, but most Argentines still use the more irreverent names.\n\nNow when I visit my favourite Buenos Aires cake shop and order a bag full of friar\u2019s balls and little cannons, I know I\u2019m not only about to enjoy something sweet with my caf\u00e9 con leche, but I\u2019m also honouring a fight for equality.\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: The text has been modified to clarify that the use of the crescent-shaped pastry by Austrians to blaspheme the Ottomans is a legend.\n\nLost in Translation is a BBC Travel series exploring encounters with languages and how they are reflected in a place, people and culture.\n\nJoin over three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

    "title": "Does wearing a coat indoors make you colder once outside?",
    "authors": [
      "Michael Evans"
    ],
    "text": "When working in a draughty office, warehouse or classroom, it is tempting to keep your coat on while inside. But most of us have also heard the advice against it because you won\u2019t \u201cfeel the benefit\u201d when you do eventually go outside.\n\nThis might seem counter intuitive. If you\u2019re cold already, surely you should do whatever you can to retain warmth? It turns out things aren\u2019t that simple. To understand what\u2019s really going on, we need to know a bit about why we feel cold in the first place.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 How your voice betrays a doomed romance\n\n\u2022 Why happy music makes you do bad things\n\n\u2022 Will this technology end traffic jams?\n\nYour body is covered with tiny temperature sensors known as cold-sensitive receptors, located on specialised nerve fibres in the skin. When the temperature drops, these receptors start to signal to the brain, in effect encoding the temperature into the nerve. These cold receptors are sometimes called menthol receptors because they also respond to the chemical menthol, which gives a cool sensation when applied to the skin.\n\nAs these nerve fibres are distributed all around the body, they enter the central nervous system at different levels. Receptors on the arms, torso, legs or shoulders connect to neurons in the spinal cord, while those on the face, head or mouth connect directly to the brain stem. But because the nerves conduct their electrical signals so rapidly, the distance from the cold body part to the brain has little effect on how quickly we detect the cold.\n\nThe signals travel to a multi-sensory gate-keeper in the centre of the brain, called the thalamus. From the thalamus, signals pass to the somatosensory cortex, which is what creates the sensation and awareness of feeling cold. From this, the brain can work out both the location of the cold spot on the body surface, and to some extent how cold it actually is. At temperature extremes, hot or cold, you also feel pain due to skin damage.\n\nWearing a coat indoors is likely to raise your average skin temperature, including the exposed parts\n\nWhen you go outside (or anywhere that is colder than where you\u2019ve just been), your nervous system detects the temperature through your exposed skin, in particular the face. Wearing a coat indoors is likely to raise your average skin temperature, including the exposed parts.\n\nAnd while your coat will insulate your body from this temperature drop when you go outside, the air will feel colder, particularly on the exposed skin, than it would have done otherwise. This feeling would be accentuated even further if wearing your coat indoors has made you sweat, which would cool your exposed skin more quickly.\n\nHowever, once you get over the initial sense of coldness, your coat will still do its job and you will feel its benefit. Your body is very effective at maintaining its core temperature of 37\u00b0C, unless you are ill or experience extreme temperatures. Even if you feel colder when you first go outside, your coat will help to reduce your body\u2019s heat loss and make it easier to maintain your core temperature. It also keeps the cold air away from much of your skin.\n\nWhether or not you\u2019ve just put on your coat when you go outside, your body has an effective way of trying to warm itself up\n\nWhether or not you\u2019ve just put on your coat when you go outside, your body has an effective way of trying to warm itself up. As they travel to the brain, the signals from your cold-sensitive receptors also pass to the hypothalamus, a complex collection of nerve cells at the base of the brain, the amygdala, and other centres beneath the hypothalamus, in the brain stem. The hypothalamus controls our response to temperature (among other things), and the amygdala engages our emotions.\n\nWhen the signals activate these brain centres, your body will try to raise its temperature, particularly its core temperature, by a coordinated system of shivering, moving blood away from the skin surface, increasing your heart rate and intensifying your breathing to boost the circulation, along with the oxygen and nutrients it provides. Through this multi-organ response, the body prevents heat loss through the skin and generates heat through muscular activity and biochemical reactions.\n\nThis means that technically, you should be able to lose weight by being cold since the body is then forced to generate more heat, using up energy. But we wouldn\u2019t advise going outside in winter without your coat as a weight-loss technique. It\u2019s true that obesity can reduce life expectancy, but so can extreme cold, and much more effectively.\n\n* Michael Evans is a senior lecturer in neuroscience at Keele University.

    "text": "Do you dream of swimming with sea turtles, touching a tiger, or getting up close with an ape?\n\nEncounters with incredible animals in exotic locations top many people\u2019s bucket lists, but there is a danger that your holiday of a lifetime experience could be exploiting vulnerable animals and habitats. As a photojournalist, Emily Garthwaite has recorded animals suffering behind the scenes in tourist hotspots across Asia. In Jaipur, India, she has evidence of so-called \u2018sanctuaries\u2019 mistreating elephants and forcing them to provide tourist rides despite the animals suffering profound stress. In Sumatra, Indonesia, Garthwaite has witnessed orangutans that have been habituated to expect food from unregistered guides and become aggressively defensive of this resource. Add in crowds and flash photography and it\u2019s a tragic situation.\n\nThese tours are often part of a package deal, and while there has been some effort by travel companies to filter out the most unethical tours, there is still huge demand for intimate experiences that offer no benefits to the animals.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of it being a spectacle \u2013 there\u2019s an apathy to it. [Tourists] don\u2019t make the connection between the animal and the experience,\u201d says Garthwaite. She questions what motivates us to have these artificial interactions: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here? Is it not enough to see it as it is? Why do we have to touch, and take, and ride things? We seem to need to be involved in some way for it to be authentic.\u201d\n\nGarthwaite seeks to provide an emotional connection between her subjects and her audience through her photography. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard dynamic where you want the audience to be engaged but not upset,\u201d she explains. By framing her subjects as equals, she aims to help audiences reflect on images and understand the feelings and experiences of the animals. \u201cEye contact is really important in photographs with animals because that allows the audience to really look at the animal.\u201d\n\nCaptive sun bear in Tandjung Medang, Sumatra, Indonesia \u00a9 Emily Garthwaite/Wildlife Photographer of the Year\n\nRecently, her photograph of a captive sun bear kept in appalling conditions was highly commended by the judges of the Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition. She has since been overwhelmed by concerned people asking after the future of the bear. Through the Sumatran sun bear team, a sanctuary is being set up to care for the many bears that have been rescued from similarly bleak situations. It will hopefully be a positive new chapter for the bears, but Garthwaite is determined to keep sharing the stories of these animals to encourage people to think before you book.\n\n\u201cTourists have to remember that if you are paying a cheap price \u2013 you are going to get a dodgy experience,\u201d she warns. \u201cYou should be paying for something that is authentic and has the animals\u2019 interests at heart, it should be their welfare that is put first.\u201d\n\nThe expert advice is to do your homework. \u201cThere can be good wildlife experiences,\u201d says Hannah Brooks, Community Engagement Manager at Chester Zoo. She urges holidaymakers to check the conservation credentials of tour providers and establishments before you visit, and to ensure your money will be spent locally. \u201cIf the local community benefit from the wildlife around them, then that gives them the motivation to look after it,\u201d she says.\n\nChester Zoo\u2019s conservationists work to encourage high standards of animal care around the world, including a collaboration with the Indonesian Zoo and Aquarium Association (PKBSI). As well as sharing their knowledge and skills in species management, they have worked with zoo staff to improve the educational information they offer visitors.\n\n\u201cIt became clear that they were doing lots of education work, but they weren\u2019t necessarily doing conservation education work \u2013 so they didn\u2019t include messages about why animals are threatened in the wild and how people can take action to help,\u201d Brooks explains. \u201cThat was the real game-changer\u2026 to realise that if they just add in a few more messages that can get [visitors] more active in conservation.\u201d\n\nSouth East Asia is a hub for illegal wildlife trade, so Brooks and her colleagues collaborate with local communities to understand the monetary and cultural motivations behind the activity. Through educational programmes, the conservationists aim to encourage alternatives that both benefit communities and protect wildlife.\n\nThe Wildlife Witness app is helping tourists report animals in need\n\nSometimes, even with the best of intentions, you can find yourself face-to-face with animal exploitation. But there is still a way you can help wildlife on holiday. Chester Zoo are also partners on the smartphone app project Wildlife Witness that tourists can use to report illegal wildlife trade. For example, if you see pangolins for sale, or a captive tiger in distress, you can record the location and details so officials can investigate and intervene.\n\nRather than turning animal encounters into instant gratification - a tick on the list, or quick hit Instagram post - we can engage with wildlife more sensitively. Even photographer Garthwaite recommends putting your lens down to properly question and appreciate your environment.\n\nShe fondly recalls a childhood memory from a visit to Durrell Wildlife Park, Jersey, where her father worked as a zoologist. \u201c[The enclosure] was so dense with foliage you could barely see anything. But from a distance, I saw the paw of a spectacled bear and I was satisfied.\u201d\n\nWhen you take your time and engage all your senses, even a distant view or partial glimpse of an animal can be exhilarating. Wherever you are, animal encounters should be respectful - and unforgettable for the right reasons.\n\nBy Ella Davies\n\nFeatured image by Steve Woods Photography/Getty"

The city of Taichung\u2019s 2.8 million residents are asleep, its flashing neon signs are off and the only movement cutting through the night is the silhouette of a 96-year-old man slowly painting alone in the darkness.\n\nEvery morning, Huang Yung-fu flips on a light, shuffles out of his two-room bungalow in sandals and carries a handful of paint tins into the streets outside. While the city around him sleeps, Huang crouches on a stool for three hours and quietly decorates the drab cement walls, pavement and windows with an explosion of playful murals in kaleidoscopic colours.\n\nWhat began years ago with a single hand-painted bird on Huang\u2019s bedroom wall has since grown into tens of thousands of illustrations. Today, this whimsical world of cartoon-like people, abstract animals and surrealist art is splashed across every centimetre of concrete in this former military settlement \u2013 called Rainbow Village. And now, more than one million visitors flock to the village every year to meet its elderly artist and lone permanent resident, affectionately known as \u2018Grandpa Rainbow\u2019."

    "text": "The BBC crew captured this breathtaking behaviour for the very first time\n\nThink of singing animals and your mind will probably be drawn to bird-song, whale-song or the Lion King. So before hitting play, it is worth noting the difference between a call and a song. A call is an isolated cry made irregularly whereas songs are longer, comprising of different syllables and are performed regularly. The range of animals that can \u2018sing\u2019 is broader than you might imagine, as are their motivations for performing. So, let's start nature\u2019s playlist, starting with a political track.\n\nThe Dynasties crew witnessed a behaviour that had never been seen before \u00a9 Nick Lyon\n\nWhile filming painted wolves for Dynasties, the crew observed, and heard, a behaviour that had never been recorded before. The pack of painted wolves had been left without a leader, which is unusual. Normally, leaders are ousted and replaced by their challenger, but this particular pack\u2019s matriarch, Tait, had died unexpectedly. Several months after Tait\u2019s death, the wolves started to pair up into male/female couples and began to howl together in a duet. While not exactly the same noise, it was similar to the cry they use when one of the pack goes missing. However, none of the pack had disappeared.\n\n\u201cIt was incredible,\u201d said Nick Lyon, producer and director on Dynasties, on the fourth episode of the BBC Earth podcast. \u201cIt was a magical feeling and because none of us had heard it before, we were looking at each other going \u2018what\u2019s this?\u2019 But then also then not wanting to talk because we were just enjoying the sound. They were in quite a hyper state during all of this. I think there was a mixture of excitement and stress. Certainly wasn\u2019t a relaxed affair.\u201d\n\nThe crew speculated that this was to test out new pairings and find a new dominant couple to lead the pack. Enough evidence wasn\u2019t gathered to confirm the theory, but they believe that it will open up the topic for further research in the future.\n\nFurther research is needed to confirm why painted wolves 'sing' \u00a9 Nick Lyon\n\nSinging-contests in the natural world are not normally used to fill power vacuums, but to attract sexual partners. One unlikely musical species are mice. Male mice sing to find mates, but this is performed at an ultrasonic frequency, so humans can\u2019t hear them. A 2015 study found that this mating cry isn\u2019t the same every time and alters depending on the context. When responding to fresh female urine, the male mouse performs a more complex, multi-syllable and multi-sequence song whereas simpler songs are used in face-to-face seductions. The study suggests that the female mice prefer the more complex songs, which are more energetic performances. It is worth noting that the mice mating song varies depending on where in the world they live.\n\nSinging can serve other functions in nature than for procreating. The croak of the Pacific Tree Frog might not initially appear to be the most melodious, but they have a variety of songs for different situations. The singing usually begins at sunset, peaking an hour later before fading away about three hours after that. While male Pacific Tree Frogs sing primarily to attract mates, they also have a second song which has a related, but different purpose.\n\nIt's not just birds and humans that sing \u00a9 Nick Lyon\n\nBeing too close to each other minimises the chance of successfully wooing, so the male frogs have to space themselves out at minimum distance of 20cm between them. However, if one of the frogs have a particular loud cry, this distance could be greater. The frogs will vary when they start singing in order to distinguish themselves amongst the chorus; harmonising would reduce their reproductive chances. Male frogs have to attract a mate in every sense of the word, not only does their call have to distinguish them as an appealing partner, but literally enable the female frogs to find them!\n\nThis behaviour is also observed in Male Sac-Winged Bats who use song to defend their territories. They emit a low-frequency song, but if they detect a similar low-frequency tune, they increase the rate and length at which they sing. Male Sac-Winged Bats whose sing at lower frequency for longer are rewarded with more children. They have a separate mating song, which are longer than their territorial defence songs and tended to be targeted at specific females.\n\nAnimals can indeed sing, with the songs each species of animal being comparable to musical genres. Distinct, wildly different and not to everyone's tastes. While animals can sing, don\u2019t expect them to be gracing any televised singing contests anytime soon. Then again, there have been odder Eurovision entries.\n\nIntroducing the BBC Earth Podcast\n\nBBC Earth presents a podcast the size of a planet, telling stories about nature, science and our human experience.\n\nSubscribe wherever you get your podcasts:\n\nBy Alfie Shaw\n\nFeatured image by Nick Lyon"

    "text": "From her breakthrough in TV comedies in the early 2000s to her award-winning performance on the big screen in The Favourite in 2019, British actress Olivia Colman is fast becoming both a national treasure and a major Hollywood player.\n\nShe has already won a Golden Globe for best actress so far this awards season and been shortlisted for a Bafta, with an Oscar nomination likely later this month.\n\nAt the age of 44, Colman has reached star status after appearing in a vast array of TV shows and films.\n\nShe first caught our attention as a sidekick to Robert Webb and David Mitchell in sketch shows and sitcoms like Peep Show, Bruiser and That Mitchell and Webb Look (pictured).\n\nIn 2008, she appeared in a BBC Four drama to mark the centenary of Mills & Boon, playing a typist who writes a steamy hospital romance. The cast also included a certain Jodie Whittaker as the wife of the publishing house's co-founder Charles Boon.\n\nColman played mum Debbie in BBC Two's Beautiful People a year later, a story about a boy who rose from his suburban English upbringing to running a New York fashion house.\n\nThe wife of Tom Hollander's priest in BBC sitcom Rev often found herself below his flock in her husband's priorities.\n\nImage copyright Shutterstock\n\nThe actress showed a different side in the hard-hitting independent film Tyrannosaur in 2011, and credits director Paddy Considine with allowing her to show her dramatic skills.\n\nThat led to roles in tougher shows like Accused (Mo's Story), an instalment of Jimmy McGovern's crime anthology. It earned her a Bafta TV Award for best supporting actress in 2013.\n\nAt the same ceremony, she also won best female performance in a TV comedy for playing Sally, the PA to Hugh Bonneville's Olympic mandarin in the BBC's Twenty Twelve.\n\nImage copyright ITV/REX/Shutterstock\n\nAnother big hit came in the form of ITV's crime drama Broadchurch, in which she played DS Ellie Miller opposite David Tennant, earning her another Bafta the following year.\n\nShe popped up as a gloriously hideous stepmother in Phoebe Waller-Bridge's comedy Fleabag - and received yet another Bafta TV nomination.\n\nImage copyright BBC/The Ink Factory\n\nHer role as spy boss Angela in glossy drama The Night Manager led to her first Golden Globe win - for best supporting actress in a limited TV series in 2017.\n\nImage copyright 20th Century Fox\n\nTwo years on, she now has another Golden Globe, thanks to her delectable performance as the fragile Queen Anne in The Favourite.\n\nImage copyright Sophie Mutevelian/Netflix\n\nAnd she will be seen playing another monarch later in 2019 when she takes over the role of Queen Elizabeth II in Netflix's royal saga The Crown.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Did anyone think about planning the actual festival?\"\n\nSeth, who blogs under the name William Needham Finley IV, live-tweeted his experience and his videos have now had millions of views.\n\nThe Netflix documentary, Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened, focuses on the disastrous build-up to the event - which was organised by businessman Billy McFarland.\n\nA rival doc was released earlier this week on US streaming service Hulu.\n\nWhile Fyre was promoted as an exclusive party for wealthy Instagram influencers, Seth says there were more ordinary people at the event than Insta-famous models.\n\n\"Everyone watching assumed everyone there was an influencer who was wealthy, who had been flown down and was expecting this life of luxury but was being slapped in the face with reality,\" says Seth.\n\nImage copyright Netflix Image caption The most famous image from Fyre Festival was of a bad cheese sandwich reportedly served to guests\n\n\"Some people I talked to had spent $500 (\u00a3386) on their tickets and it was their spring break from college.

There were hundreds of day labourers working,\" says Chris.\n\n\"Fyre had such a high profile that I don't think anyone could have assumed that it wouldn't work out.\"\n\nImage copyright Netflix Image caption Billy McFarland is currently serving a six-year jail term for fraud\n\nOne restaurant owner in the documentary admits she stumped up $50,000 (\u00a338,500) of her life-savings catering for Fyre Festival in the build up to the event.\n\n\"She put in a huge part of her savings to try and live up to the obligations she had made to them,\" says Chris.\n\n\"In the end, when things fell apart everyone just left. She was left having to deal with this.\n\n\"Nobody went back to deal with that and that people moved on and came back to living their lives in New York and didn't own up to the responsibility of their actions.\"\n\nOrganiser Billy McFarland failed to pay workers on the island for their time or resources.\n\nImage copyright Netflix Image caption Excitement on Great Exuma was short lived once festival goers arrived at the Fyre site\n\nHe's the one man missing from the documentary - Chris says he refused to be interviewed unless he was paid for his time.\n\n\"We just didn't feel comfortable with him benefitting after so many people had been hurt based on what he had done,\" he adds.\n\nFollowing Fyre's collapse, Billy was convicted of fraud and jailed for six years in October last year.\n\nRapper Ja Rule was originally described as a co-organiser of the event - but was not arrested or charged in connection with the fraud. His lawyers have argued that McFarland used his name and connections to promote the event.\n\n\"Six years doesn't seem to fit with what he did and the impact he had on everyone else,\" says Seth.\n\nHe successfully sued Billy for $2.5m (\u00a31.9m) - but expects to wait up to 20 years to get his money back as the fraudster must pay back $27m (\u00a320m) to investors before settling other debts.\n\n\"I'm not in a position to say he should spend 20 years in prison but six years doesn't seem like a lot.\n\n\"I don't think we've heard the last of Billy - at all.\"\n\nImage copyright Netflix Image caption Ja Rule's lawyers argued that McFarland used his name and connections to promote the event\n\nSeth hopes money gets to the people on Great Exuma first, and believes attention from the new documentaries could be what helps get them repaid.\n\n\"Hopefully we can work on getting the people in the Bahamas paid back too,\" he adds.\n\n\"With people like Netflix involved and these influencers, there's no reason why some money can't be raised to make it right for those people.\"\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here."

    "text": "Explorers throughout history have searched for the legendary fountain of youth. And while the elusive fountain has yet to be found, certain places across the world have emerged as centres where people live substantially longer than the worldwide average (around 71 years), and each has its own secret source of vitality.\n\nWe talked to residents in some of the countries where people live the longest, as ranked by the 2017 World Happiness Report, to uncover the reasons why these places seem to nurture longevity.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2013 Five pricey cities you can now afford\n\n\u2013 The world's most welcoming countries\n\n\u2013 The happiest countries for expats\n\nJapan\n\nLiving to 83 on average, the Japanese have long had one of the highest life expectancies. Okinawa, often called \u2018the land of immortals\u2019, has been a global centre for longevity research, as these southern Japanese islands have more than 400 centenarians. Much credit for this has been given to the local diet, which includes plentiful tofu and sweet potato, and a small amount of fish. Active social circles among older residents and a strong community also contribute to lower levels of stress and a strong sense of belonging.\n\nOkinawa, often called \u2018the land of immortals\u2019, has been a global centre for longevity research\n\nTo reap these benefits, learning the language as an expat is critical, said Daniele Gatti, CEO of Velvet Media and long-time Japan resident. \u201cJapan has an amazing quality of life if you can get past the language hurdle to better understand the mentality\u201d \u2013 which is more different from Western culture than most visitors think, he added. \u201cExpats willing to move here should think seriously about putting a major time allocation into learning the language. It\u2019s key to integrating deeper in the local society and living a full and meaningful life.\u201d\n\nSpain\n\nThe Mediterranean diet, rich in heart-healthy olive oil, vegetables and wine, has long contributed to Spain\u2019s long-lived population (averaging 82.8). But Spain has another longevity secret up its sleeve: the siesta.\n\nSpain has another longevity secret up its sleeve: the siesta\n\n\u201cPeople think all the Spaniards are doing la siesta when the shops are closed between 2:00 and 5:00, but it is simply how the working shift is organised,\u201d said Miquel \u00c0ngel Diez i Besora from Barcelona and Gray Line tour guide. \u201cIf you have a continuous shift and just a half an hour break for lunch, then you eat a quick takeaway. On the contrary, if you are forced to stop for two or three hours, then you go home or go to a restaurant where you can sit down, eat two courses and dessert, and have time enough to digest well, it\u2019s going to be healthier than a takeaway.\u201d\n\nThe density of Spanish cities also gets people moving more, since shops and restaurants all tend to be within walking distance of most people\u2019s residences.\n\n\u201cWhen I moved to Barcelona from Moscow, I noticed that people here favour walking or biking, even walking few blocks to take public transport instead of using their own vehicles,\u201d said Marina Manasyan, co-founder of Barcelona Eat Local Food Tours. \u201cYou get your cells oxygenated and you reduce your carbon footprint.\u201d\n\nSingapore\n\nWith broad access to the country\u2019s state-of-the-art medical facilities and what\u2019s been called a \u2018miracle\u2019 healthcare system, Singaporeans are living longer than ever at an average of 83.1 years old. The country has one of the lowest maternal and infant mortality rates in the world, and makes preventative care a focus of its healthcare.\n\nWith broad access to a \u2018miracle\u2019 healthcare system, Singaporeans are living longer than ever\n\nThe culture and accessible urban environment also contributes to a longer life. \u201cYou will see a lot of people going to gyms or exercising in the public parks, which are plentiful,\u201d said Bino Chua, a current resident and travel blogger at I Wander. The country even recently opened its first therapeutic park, designed to reduce stress and improve mental wellbeing among aging adults.\n\nHealth-averse habits are also harder to maintain in Singapore. \u201cExpats should know that \u2018vices\u2019 are a lot more expensive here,\u201d said Chau. \u201cCigarettes and alcohol are heavily taxed and cost a lot more than in other countries.\u201d\n\nSwitzerland\n\nMen fare better in Switzerland than anywhere else in the world, living to be 81 on average. As one of Europe\u2019s wealthiest countries, access to high-quality healthcare, strong personal safety and sense of wellbeing contributes to the high rank \u2013 with some studies even pointing to the country\u2019s high intake of cheese and dairy as a leading factor.\n\nMen fare better in Switzerland than anywhere else in the world\n\nThough the country can be very career focused with many expats moving for work at one of the country\u2019s many international headquarters, its central location makes it easy to balance frequent relaxing escapes. \u201cIt\u2019s a career pinnacle, location-wise,\u201d said Gatti, who has also lived in Switzerland. \u201cLiving here allows for wonderful weekend trips all over the continent and to spend time outdoors in the enchanting Alps.\u201d The private schools are also some of the \u201cbest on the planet,\u201d he added, which makes it appealing to young families.\n\nSouth Korea\n\nSouth Korea is set to be the first country to hit a life expectancy of 90 years according to recent research, which credits a strong and growing economy, broad access to healthcare and lower blood pressure than Western countries for its upward trajectory.\n\nThe country also has a diet rich in fermented foods, which are said to lower cholesterol, boost immunity and inhibit cancer. \u201cAs a whole, Korean food is high in fibre and nutrient-dense,\u201d Hoheb said.\n\nSouth Korea is set to be the first country to hit a life expectancy of 90 years\n\nResidents say a cultural focus on community and the associated traditions contributes to the everyday quality of life here. \u201cThe Jimjilbang (public bathhouse) brings together people to recreate, to socialise and to help reduce stress,\u201d said Camille Hoheb, founder of Wellness Tourism Worldwide. \u201cIn South Korea, there\u2019s also an overall sense of mindfulness that comes with the Buddhist mindset and an overall attitude toward a culture of cooperation versus individualism.\u201d\n\nJoin over three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

    "text": "Until last year, Borris would never turn down a pork chop. He was partial to ice cream during the summer and loved a Sunday roast in the winter \u2013 including beef with Yorkshire pudding, pigs in blankets, mashed potatoes, and a selection of vegetables.\n\nBorris is a five-year-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. By the time his owner, Annemarie Formoy, entered him into the PDSA Pet Fit Club competition, which helps obese cats and dogs slim down, he was 28kg \u2013 almost double his recommended weight. It took two people to lift him into the car, he had arthritis in one leg and his breathing was laboured. Thanks to a tailored six-month diet and exercise regime he is now 7kg lighter and has just been crowned joint competition winner with Sadie the Labrador.\n\nBorris, at his heaviest, was not alone. The worldwide prevalence of pet obesity lies between 22% and 44%, and rates seem to be rising. The reasons why are fairly predictable. Owners of overweight dogs feed them more snacks and table scraps, are more likely to have their pets present as they prepare their own meals and are less likely to walk them daily. Owners of obese cats tend to use food as a reward and play with them less. If a dog owner is obese, the chances are their pet will be too (this doesn\u2019t apply to cats).\n\nObesity also seems to be occurring even in some animals who aren't being overfed or under-exercised\n\nBut obesity also seems to be occurring even in some domestic and wild animals who aren\u2019t being overfed or under-exercised. If these findings are true, something else must be driving obesity and uncovering those could help tackle our own epidemic with the condition.\n\nMore than 1.9 billion human adults are overweight. Of these, more than 650 million are obese \u2013 that\u2019s about 13% of the world\u2019s adult human population. The worldwide prevalence of obesity has nearly tripled since 1975. And childhood obesity has risen alarmingly too \u2013 an estimated 41 million children under the age of five are overweight or obese.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 The air that makes you fat\n\n\u2022 Why obesity damages your mind as well as your body\n\n\u2022 The bizarre bias that affects how you shop\n\nThe first animal clue lies at the paw of the obesity-prone Labrador retriever. \u201cLabradors are consistently the headline act when it comes to overweight dogs,\u201d says Eleanor Raffan, a veterinarian and geneticist at the University of Cambridge. She and fellow researchers discovered that a genetic mutation present in around a quarter of Labradors, was associated with obesity. For each copy of the mutation \u2013 which occurred in a gene called POMC \u2013 a dog was about 2kg heavier. Most of the animals the researchers studied had one copy of the mutation, but fewer had two.\n\n\u201cThese are dogs always in the kitchen when owners are preparing food, sticking around looking for a tidbit even if there\u2019s not much chance of getting one, or scavenging yucky stuff on walks,\u201d Raffan says. \u201cBut they\u2019re not doing that because it\u2019s fun. They\u2019re doing it because they\u2019re hungry.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because POMC mutations disrupt the brain\u2019s leptin-melanocortin pathway, which regulates food intake and energy expenditure, ultimately influencing body weight. As a result, the behaviour of these Labradors becomes very food-motivated.\n\nThe drive to eat is as every much of a physiological drive and dominating thought as the feeling of being thirsty \u2013 Eleanor Raffan\n\nThere\u2019s a lesson here for humans, Raffan says. \u201cThe drive to eat is as every much of a physiological drive and dominating thought as the feeling of being thirsty.\u201d\n\nGenes play a role in human obesity (the average heritability lies between 40% and 75%), but obesity caused by a single gene is rare. POMC deficiency, associated with severe obesity in infancy, has been reported in fewer than 50 people worldwide, although there are likely thousands of undiagnosed cases. But mostly, human obesity reflects multiple genetic risk variants (each with small effects) interacting in a complex way with environmental factors.\n\nThe good news is that animals could help us disentangle those environmental factors, too. Factory farm animals are traditionally fattened with antibiotics that transform their gut so they need less food to gain weight. New regulations have pushed antibiotic use in UK food-producing animals to their lowest level since data were first published and the EU has banned antibiotics as growth promoters in feed.\n\nIf antibiotics fatten animals, could they be doing the same to humans?\n\nThe answer to that question lies in your gut. The microbiome describes the genomes of the vast colonies of micro-organisms \u2013 bacteria, fungi, protozoa, viruses, all 100 trillion of them \u2013 living in your digestive system. This community influences your weight: germ-free mice that receive gut microbes from an obese (human) twin gain more weight and body fat than mice that receive microbes from the lean twin. An imbalance in the microbiome possibly leads to not only obesity, but irritable bowel syndrome, coeliac disease, and type 2 diabetes.\n\nBabies given antibiotics in the first six months of life led to an increased risk of being overweight in later childhood\n\nSo what causes this sort of imbalance? There is a genetic element. But in studies of animals, high-intensity sweeteners and food additives like the emulsifiers used in many processed foods have been linked to lower gut bacterial diversity. In humans, babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life led to an increased risk of being overweight in later childhood, according to one study. Six weeks of antibiotics for a heart infection was also linked to significant weight gain.\n\nBut before you throw away your life-saving antibiotics, remember these studies only show an association rather than clear cause and consequence. Certain antibiotics might even shift the balance of gut microbiota away from patterns associated with obesity. Knowing this, could we somehow modify our microbiome to tackle obesity? Work is underway to do just that, with probiotics and faecal transplantation under investigation.\n\nObesity isn\u2019t just something that affects domestic animals, though. Wild animals fatten up, too, but it\u2019s usually in relation to seasonal cycles and food availability: they\u2019ve learned to eat when food is plentiful. But researchers have seen unexpected weight gain in yellow-bellied marmots (large grass squirrels) in Colorado\u2019s Rocky Mountains between 1976 and 2008. Marmots are now waking up around a month earlier from their eight-month hibernation, likely because climate change has altered the time between first snow melt and first frost. These extra days mean more feeding and fattening time. In the short-term, an extra 0.3kg could improve survival chances during hibernation and reproductive success afterwards. (Sadly, marmots will ultimately pay a high price as climate change increases the frequency of summer droughts.)\n\nMice exposed to constant light have higher body mass indices (BMIs) and glucose levels than those exposed to normal light/dark cycles\n\nOther environmental factors that affect obesity in animals \u2013 and perhaps humans \u2013 include sleep debt and light pollution. Mice exposed to constant light have higher body mass indices (BMIs) and glucose levels than those exposed to normal light/dark cycles.\n\nOestrogen-disrupting chemicals like bisphenol-A (BPA) \u2013 found in food cans, some hard plastics, and certain types of thermal paper used for receipts and tickets \u2013 are another potential culprit. Chemical manufacturers have challenged these links and the US Food and Drug Administration currently supports its safety, but the European Food Safety Authority is currently re-evaluating the toxicity of BPA and, in January 2011, the European Commission prohibited BPA for the manufacture of polycarbonate infant feeding bottles.\n\nA note of caution is needed, though. Focusing on these non-food related factors can distract from the undeniable impact of supersized processed meals. The truth is we\u2019re up against external influences that are hard to resist: ingredients designed to tap into our reward pathways, large portion sizes, and the commercial normalisation of routine sugar consumption, high fat snacks and sweetened drinks.\n\nAll this is coated by manipulative marketing and conflicted interests. Studies from obesity researchers with food industry ties were five times more likely to find no association between sugar-sweetened drinks and weight gain than studies whose authors reported no financial conflict of interest. One high profile researcher who argued against calorie listings by New York City restaurants had financial ties to Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, McDonald's, and Mars.\n\nAnimals are equally susceptible to the irresistible draw of processed food \u2013 city-dwelling tamarins in Medell\u00edn, Colombia, are fatter than their rural counterparts. Although more sedentary with easier access to fruiting trees, they also gorge on biscuits and marshmallows provided by locals. One Thailand macaque made international headlines recently when he became critically unwell through overfeeding by tourists.\n\nIf animals can teach us about the causes of obesity, they might also help us understand its treatment and prevention. And research in companion animals could hold greater relevance for humans since lab rats often do not share our genetic diversity, psychosocial stressors or environment. Raffan\u2019s Labrador study highlighted the greater similarities between canine and human POMC, compared to the rat model we traditionally study. Crucially, though, animals deserve to be helped and healed in their own right \u2013 obese pets face osteoarthritis, cancer, cardiac and respiratory problems, reproductive disorders, urinary diseases, diabetes, and pancreatitis.\n\nAn overweight dog\u2019s lifespan is up to two and a half years shorter\n\nOverweight dogs also face reduced life expectancy \u2013 their lifespan is up to two and a half years shorter compared to dogs with a healthy body weight.\n\nFor animals, the solutions sound familiar: regular exercise and a balanced food regimen. Specialist diets improve satiety so that dogs feel fuller for longer. Raffan suggests that highly food-motivated dogs can benefit from less in the bowl and more (or all) from puzzle feeders that allow them to indulge their food obsession in a non-fattening way while keeping them mentally and physically active.\n\nBut her key message is that we shouldn\u2019t view obesity as some sort of moral failing in either owners or their pets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so used to condemning humans who are overweight as being just greedy and weak-willed,\u201d she says. But, she points out, this is inaccurate: eating behaviour is susceptible to genetic drives \u2013 and dogs are an example of this. \u201cDogs don\u2019t make value judgments. They eat because they\u2019re hungry and this variability in dogs is hardwired.\u201d\n\nExperts writing in the journal Veterinary Record also caution against condemning owners without helping them or addressing underlying social problems. Although a pet\u2019s forcible removal might be necessary if they are severely threatened, they acknowledge, \u201cit cannot be a general solution to the widespread problem of canine and feline obesity\u201d. They believe that many owners don\u2019t intentionally overfeed their pets, as reflected by their tendency to underestimate their pets\u2019 weight (it was a vet who told Formoy that her dog was in trouble. \u201cBorris looked a bit big but you just try make excuses in your head,\u201d Formoy says.) Similarly, few parents of overweight children recognise their child as overweight.\n\nSocioeconomic status also influences obesity in both humans and animals, partly linked to neighbourhoods with less open green spaces and fewer fitness resources. Regardless of whether you\u2019re talking about a pet or a person, obesity is a societal health issue, not a moral one \u2013 and needs wider policy changes to be addressed.\n\nAs for Borris, Formoy says that his competition win was bittersweet. Her father had been unwell when she signed Borris up. \u201cHe was my dad\u2019s best mate and the competition encouraged my dad to go out on his mobility scooter with Borris by his side,\u201d she says. Her father passed away in July. \u201cI thought in my head, \u2018Dad, me and Borris are still going to win this for you.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe and Borris have kept that promise. Today, Borris is busy chasing Charlie Cat around the house, his own arthritis and breathing difficulties relegated to the past. In his story of obesity conquered, Borris has a few lessons for us all.\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

A lot came from [writers] David Croft and Jimmy Perry who were both ex-Army.\"\n\nBorn in August 1930 in Canning Town, east London, Windsor Davies returned home to his father's home village, Nant-y-Moel in the Ogmore valley, when World War Two broke out.\n\nHe was educated at Ogmore Grammar School and also worked as a miner, like his father, before National Service with the Army in north Africa.\n\nAfter training to be a teacher in Bangor, Davies taught English and Maths for four years in the 1950s at Leek in Staffordshire, where he was known as a joker and making his pupils laugh.\n\nBut he was also involved in amateur dramatics and was persuaded by his wife Lynne to answer an advert for a short drama course run by the Kew theatre company in London.\n\n\"Lynne said to me, 'you'll never be really happy unless you have a go at this, will you?'\" he recalled to BBC Wales in 2012.\n\nBut he had a false-start to his acting career when he was cast in a TV series called Probation Officer. \"It was a terrible mistake to have taken that job because I didn't know one end of a TV camera from the other and I didn't know how to tackle the job properly,\" he recalled.\n\nHe was given roles in uniform in police series from Z Cars to Callan and more bit-part work, not always easy with a growing family.\n\n\"I worked with virtually every comedian the BBC employed as a feed man - I'd go along and do the one scene, working with people like Dick Emery, Norman Wisdom and Charlie Drake,\" he said.\n\nAnd it was a comedy which was to propel him from jobbing actor to stardom and make him a familiar face to millions in the 1970s.\n\nImage caption The It Ain't Half Hot Mum cast in 1976\n\nDavies had first teamed up with singer Don Estelle on the northern club circuit.\n\nIn 1973, they were cast together in It Ain't Half Hot Mum, the follow-up comedy for Dad's Army creators Perry and Croft.\n\nIt was set in a Royal Artillery concert party in the last few months of World War Two in India - although the series ran for eight years.\n\nDavies played Battery Sergeant Major Williams - nicknamed Sgt Major \"Shut Up!\" - a no-nonsense, bellowing platoon leader with a love-hate relationship with the theatrical troupe.\n\nFrustrated in his endeavours to drill them as a fighting unit, he had little time for the artistic pursuits of his charges - always happier in costume than Army uniform - or the upper class twits who were his commanding officers. His authority was further subtly undermined by the camp's Indian servants.\n\nBattery Sergeant Major Williams was originally written as a Londoner and lined up for Rising Damp star Leonard Rossiter. But thankfully it was re-written for Davies as a Welshman - who made the part very much his own, even adding his own \"lovely boys\" catchphrase.\n\n\"David Croft and Jimmy Perry had auditioned a number of people and they were fed up with some of them telling them how to play the sergeant major,\" said Davies about his call to read for the role.\n\n\"I did my old Cockney bit but they said, 'hang on a minute, you're a Welshman - do it as a Welshman' and I remember thinking about a bloke I knew from the south Wales valleys, who talked this certain way, and they laughed and when I got home, my agent had called to say they wanted me.\n\n\"I thought, it's a series! Which was lovely, with me having a wife and five children.\"\n\nWith Davies alongside 4ft 9 ins tall Estelle as Gunner \"Lofty\" Sugden, It Ain't Half Hot Mum at its peak it attracted 15 million viewers a week and ran for eight series.\n\nThe pair also enjoyed a number one hit in 1975 when they recorded a version of Whispering Grass in character, a novelty hit which nevertheless sold more than a million copies.\n\nImage caption Davies pictured with Don Estelle and Max Boyce - the pair took the characters out into the wider world of light entertainment in the late 1970s\n\nThe partnership spilled over into more stage and screen appearances and TV commercials.\n\n'Something else'\n\nAnother \"chalk and cheese\" partnership saw Davies star as Oliver Smallbridge, alongside Donald Sinden as two rival antique dealers in the long-running ITV sitcom Never The Twain.\n\nAlthough overshadowed by It Ain't Half Hot Mum, it ran for more than 60 episodes.\n\nBack in Wales, Davies also starred in a one-off BBC production which gained cult status and was still fondly remembered years later - gaining a new lease of life with a DVD release.\n\nImage caption Windsor Davies in 1978's Grand Slam - his personal favourite\n\nGrand Slam was a 1978 comedy about the exploits of a group of Welsh fans who travelled to Paris for a rugby weekend.\n\nIt was shot on location during the weekend of an actual France v Wales match - with the cast even flying over with the Wales team.\n\nDavies - a self-confessed \"low grade\" rugby player in his youth - was cast as Mog Jones, the leader of the travelling group, who ends up behind bars after an incident at a strip club. He appeared alongside Welsh comic talents Hugh Griffith, Sion Probert and Dewi \"Pws\" Morris, who all were encouraged to improvise.\n\n\"That was probably the one I enjoyed most of all,\" Davies recalled.\n\n\"I enjoyed my work a lot but that was something else.\"\n\nDavies was also the voice of Sergeant Major Zero in the 1980s sci-fi series Terrahawks. As well as stage appearances, there were parts in more than 20 films, including two later Carry Ons.\n\nHe retired from acting in his 70s to live in the south of France, near Toulouse, with his wife of 62 years Eluned who died in September. They had five children."

    "text": "This story is featured in BBC Future\u2019s \u201cBest of 2018\u201d collection. Discover more of our picks.\n\n\n\nWhen trying to memorise new material, it\u2019s easy to assume that the more work you put in, the better you will perform. Yet taking the occasional down time \u2013 to do literally nothing \u2013 may be exactly what you need. Just dim the lights, sit back, and enjoy 10-15 minutes of quiet contemplation, and you\u2019ll find that your memory of the facts you have just learnt is far better than if you had attempted to use that moment more productively.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s already well known that we should pace our studies, new research suggests that we should aim for \u201cminimal interference\u201d during these breaks \u2013 deliberately avoiding any activity that could tamper with the delicate task of memory formation. So no running errands, checking your emails, or surfing the web on your smartphone. You really need to give your brain the chance for a complete recharge with no distractions.\n\nAn excuse to do nothing may seem like a perfect mnemonic technique for the lazy student, but this discovery may also offer some relief for people with amnesia and some forms of dementia, suggesting new ways to release a latent, previously unrecognised, capacity to learn and remember.\n\nThe remarkable memory-boosting benefits of undisturbed rest were first documented in 1900 by the German psychologist Georg Elias Muller and his student Alfons Pilzecker. In one of their many experiments on memory consolidation, Muller and Pilzecker first asked their participants to learn a list of meaningless syllables. Following a short study period, half the group were immediately given a second list to learn \u2013 while the rest were given a six-minute break before continuing.\n\nWhen tested one-and-a-half-hours later, the two groups showed strikingly different patterns of recall. The participants given the break remembered nearly 50% of their list, compared to an average of 28% for the group who had been given no time to recharge their mental batteries. The finding suggested that our memory for new information is especially fragile just after it has first been encoded, making it more susceptible to interference from new information.\n\nAlthough a handful of other psychologists occasionally returned to the finding, it was only in the early 2000s that the broader implications of it started to become known, with a pioneering study by Sergio Della Sala at the University of Edinburgh and Nelson Cowan at the University of Missouri.\n\nThe team was interested in discovering whether reduced interference might improve the memories of people who had suffered a neurological injury, such as a stroke. Using a similar set-up to Muller and Pilzecker\u2019s original study, they presented their participants with lists of 15 words and tested them 10 minutes later. In some trials, the participants remained busy with some standard cognitive tests; in others, they were asked to lie in a darkened room and avoid falling asleep.\n\nIt seems to benefit young and old people alike\n\nThe impact of the small intervention was more profound than anyone might have believed. Although the two most severely amnesic patients showed no benefit, the others tripled the number of words they could remember \u2013 from 14% to 49%, placing them almost within the range of healthy people with no neurological damage.\n\nThe next results were even more impressive. The participants were asked to listen to some stories and answer questions an hour later. Without the chance to rest, they could recall just 7% of the facts in the story; with the rest, this jumped to 79% \u2013 an astronomical 11-fold increase in the information they retained. The researchers also found a similar, though less pronounced, benefit for healthy participants in each case, boosting recall between 10 and 30%.\n\nDella Sala and Cowan\u2019s former student, Michaela Dewar at Heriot-Watt University, has now led several follow-up studies, replicating the finding in many different contexts. In healthy participants, they have found that these short periods of rest can also improve our spatial memories, for instance \u2013 helping participants to recall the location of different landmarks in a virtual reality environment. Crucially, this advantage lingers a week after the original learning task, and it seems to benefit young and old people alike. And besides the stroke survivors, they have also found similar benefits for people in the earlier, milder stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nIn each case, the researchers simply asked the participants to sit in a dim, quiet room, without their mobile phones or similar distractions. \u201cWe don\u2019t give them any specific instructions with regards to what they should or shouldn\u2019t do while resting,\u201d Dewar says. \u201cBut questionnaires completed at the end of our experiments suggest that most people simply let their minds wander.\u201d\n\nEven then, we should be careful not to exert ourselves too hard as we daydream. In one study, for instance, participants were asked to imagine a past or future event during their break, which appeared to reduce their later recall of the newly learnt material. So it may be safest to avoid any concerted mental effort during our down time.\n\nThe exact mechanism is still unknown, though some clues come from a growing understanding of memory formation. It is now well accepted that once memories are initially encoded, they pass through a period of consolidation that cements them in long-term storage. This was once thought to happen primarily during sleep, with heightened communication between the hippocampus \u2013 where memories are first formed \u2013 and the cortex, a process that may build and strengthen the new neural connections that are necessary for later recall.\n\nThis heightened nocturnal activity may be the reason that we often learn things better just before bed. But in line with Dewar\u2019s work, a 2010 study by Lila Davachi at New York University, found that it was not limited to sleep, and similar neural activity occurs during periods of wakeful rest, too. In the study, participants were first asked to memorise pairs of pictures \u2013 matching a face to an object or scene \u2013 and then allowed to lie back and let their minds wander for a short period. Sure enough, she found increased communication between the hippocampus and areas of the visual cortex during their rest. Crucially, people who showed a greater increase in connectivity between these areas were the ones who remembered more of the task, she says.\n\nPerhaps the brain takes any potential down time to cement what it has recently learnt \u2013 and reducing extra stimulation at this time may ease that process. It would seem that neurological damage may render the brain especially vulnerable to that interference after learning a new memory, which is why the period of rest proved to be particularly potent for stroke survivors and people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nOther psychologists are excited about the research. \u201cThe effect is quite consistent across studies now in a range of experiments and memory tasks,\u201d says Aidan Horner at the University of York. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating.\u201d Horner agrees that it could potentially offer new ways to help individuals with impairments to function.\n\nPractically speaking, he points out that it may be difficult to schedule enough periods of rest to increase their overall daily recall. But he thinks it could still be valuable to help a patient learn important new information \u2013 such as learning the name and face of a new carer. \u201cPerhaps a short period of wakeful rest after that would increase the chances that they would remember that person, and therefore feel more comfortable with them later on.\u201d Dewar tells me that she is aware of one patient who seems to have benefitted from using a short rest to learn the name of their grandchild, though she emphasises that it is only anecdotal evidence.\n\nThomas Baguley at Nottingham Trent University in the UK is also cautiously optimistic. He points out that some Alzheimer\u2019s patients are already advised to engage in mindfulness techniques to alleviate stress and improve overall well-being. \u201cSome [of these] interventions may also promote wakeful rest and it is worth exploring whether they work in part because of reducing interference,\u201d he says, though it may be difficult to implement in people with severe dementia, he says.\n\nBeyond the clinical benefits for these patients, Baguley and Horner both agree that scheduling regular periods of rest, without distraction, could help us all hold onto new material a little more firmly. After all, for many students, the 10-30% improvements recorded in these studies could mark the difference between a grade or two. \u201cI can imagine you could embed these 10-15 minute breaks within a revision period,\u201d says Horner, \u201cand that might be a useful way of making small improvements to your ability to remember later on.\u201d\n\nIn the age of information overload, it\u2019s worth remembering that our smartphones aren\u2019t the only thing that needs a regular recharge. Our minds clearly do too.\n\n--\n\nDavid Robson is a freelance writer based in London.

YouTube said it \u201cworked to aggressively enforce our monetisation policies to eliminate the incentive for this abuse\u201d.\n\nCrossing the line\n\nBut enforcing its new rules on pranks may prove even more difficult, given ambiguity over what may or may not be considered harmful.\n\n\u201cYouTube is home to many beloved viral challenges and pranks,\u201d a message added to the site\u2019s FAQ section read.\n\n\u201cThat said, we\u2019ve always had policies to make sure what\u2019s funny doesn\u2019t cross the line into also being harmful or dangerous.\n\n\u201cOur Community Guidelines prohibit content that encourages dangerous activities that are likely to result in serious harm, and today clarifying what this means for dangerous challenges and pranks.\u201d\n\nFrom now on, the site said it would not allow videos that featured \u201cpranks with a perceived danger of serious physical injury\".\n\nThis includes pranks where someone is tricked into thinking they are in severe danger, even if no real threat existed.\n\nChild trauma\n\nThe site added: \u201cWe also don\u2019t allow pranks that cause children to experience severe emotional distress, meaning something so bad that it could leave the child traumatized for life.\u201d\n\nYouTube said it had worked closely with child psychologists on what might constitute a traumatic experience. It did not post a full list, but said it included scenarios where a child is tricked into believing their parents had died.\n\nThe new rules come in response to several instances of pranks and stunts that are seriously ill-advised at best, and deadly at worst.\n\nIn May, Minnesota woman Monalisa Perez, 20, was sentenced to six months in prison after shooting dead her boyfriend, Mario Ruiz. The couple had hoped video of their stunt, in which an encyclopaedia was meant to protect Mr Ruiz, would go viral on YouTube.\n\nAlso last year, the American Association of Poison Control Centers reported a spike in reported cases of illness from detergent ingestion following a craze that had people eating pods containing laundry detergent.\n\nIt prompted the product\u2019s maker, Procter and Gamble, to enlist the help of American Football star Rob Gronkowski to front a public awareness campaign on social media.\n\nMore recently, a challenge inspired by a scene in Netflix show Birdbox involved carrying out activities - such as driving - while blindfolded. At least one person is known to have crashed as a result.\n\n________\n\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\n\nDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

    "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Nicholas Witchell says the Duke regularly drives in the Sandringham area\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh has been involved in a car crash while driving near the Queen's Sandringham estate, Buckingham Palace has said.\n\nPrince Philip, 97, was not injured in the accident, which happened as he drove a Land Rover out of a driveway onto the A149 shortly before 15:00 GMT.\n\nThe other car involved was a Kia. Two women in it needed hospital treatment - they have since been discharged.\n\nEyewitnesses said the duke's Land Rover overturned during the collision.\n\nThey said they helped the duke out of the vehicle. He was conscious but very, very shocked and shaken, they added.\n\nNorfolk police said it was force policy to breath test drivers involved in collisions and both had provided negative readings.\n\nThe duke is back at Sandringham and has seen a doctor as a precaution.\n\nA woman who drove past the crash scene - near Babingley, a small village north of King's Lynn in Norfolk - at around 15:40 said she saw an ambulance and \"a heavy police presence\".\n\n\"I was just going down the A149 \u2026 and saw a lot of blue flashing lights ahead,\" she said. \"I saw a black, 4x4 type car on its side and me and my son were like 'oh my word, that doesn't look good'.\n\n\"Luckily it was just sort of on the side of the road, the road wasn't closed in any way.\n\n\"Obviously it looked quite smashed in. I'm quite amazed he [the duke] is okay actually.\"\n\nNorfolk police confirmed officers were called to the scene shortly before 3pm after a Land Rover and a Kia were involved in a collision.\n\nIt had previously been reported the duke had been driving a Range Rover.\n\nThe driver of the Kia suffered cuts, while the passenger sustained an arm injury, police said. Both were treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Prince Philip crash: \"People stopped to help\" - eyewitness\n\nA statement said the road remained open and both vehicles were recovered a short time later.\n\nNick Cobb, a long-time Babingley resident, was driving past with his 16-year-old daughter Emily at about 15:10 GMT when they spotted an overturned car about 100 yards from their house.\n\n\"The [Land Rover] was on its side on a private road.\n\n\"The other car was well into the hedge on the opposite side of the road.\n\n\"There was lots of debris in the road, lots of glass and lots of other cars, some police cars, some from the Sandringham Estate and about six ordinary looking cars that looked as though they had stopped to help.\n\nImage caption Smashed glass and parts of a car left at the roadside at the scene of the crash\n\n\"We only found out that it was the duke's car when we saw it on the news. The road was not blocked by the crash and was open when we came past.\"\n\nThe BBC's Nic Rigby, at the scene, says all that's left are pieces of broken glass and the remnants of a wing mirror.\n\nIt has been a chilly day, he adds, and there were small flurries of snow in parts of Norfolk, but nothing that troubled the county's roads.\n\nThe Queen and Prince Philip have been staying at the estate in Norfolk since Christmas.\n\nThe Archbishop of York, John Sentamu, tweeted a prayer in support to the duke, and later another one for the two other people involved in the accident.\n\nAnalysis: 'Surprise that the duke still drives'\n\nBy BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond\n\nThere will be several sharp intakes of breath over this accident.\n\nThe first will be over the good news - that the Duke escaped unscathed. A photo of what is believed to be the accident shows what looks like a Land Rover resting on its driver side, having turned or flipped as a result of the collision.

That said, the joy of swimming without a wetsuit is the ultimate cold-water high: bringing a rush of endorphins and pure exhilaration. Winter swimmers frequently become addicted, because a two-minute swim can leave you feeling good all day.\u2019 According to Harper, a cold swim increases your basal metabolic rate, meaning you burn off more calories afterwards. And reports of a more robust immune system are common among the winter-swimming community, which is growing in number overseas and in the UK.\n\nTempted?

    "title": "Is juicing actually good for you?",
    "authors": [
      "Jessica Brown"
    ],
    "text": "Freshly juiced fruit has become a staple in many diets \u2013 especially those of busy, health-conscious consumers who can save time on making (and perhaps even chewing) their food without missing out on nutrients. Fruit juice also has been linked to claims that it can help you both lose weight, and \u2018detox\u2019 your system.\n\nAll of which, of course, has made it highly lucrative. The global fruit and vegetable juices market was valued at $154 billion (\u00a3123bn) in 2016 and is expected to grow.\n\nBut is juicing really as healthy as we think?\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 Is breakfast the most important meal of the day?\n\n\u2022 Are you eating enough salt?\n\n\u2022 Cold remedies: Old wives\u2019 tales\u2026 or legitimate science?\n\nMost foods containing fructose \u2013 a naturally occurring sugar found in all fruits and fruit juices \u2013 don't seem to have harmful effects as long as they're not contributing to excess daily calories. This is because the fibre found in whole fruits is intact, and the sugar is contained within the fruit's cells. It takes our digestive system a while to break these cells down and for fructose to enter the bloodstream.\n\nBut this is not the case with fruit juice.\n\nFibre mechanics\n\n\u201cFruit juice has most of the fibre removed,\u201d says Emma Elvin, senior clinical advisor at the charity Diabetes UK. This is why, unlike whole fruit, the fructose in fruit juices counts as \u2018free sugars\u2019 \u2013 which also include honey and the sugars added to foods. It\u2019s recommended by the World Health Organisation that adults have no more than 30g of added sugar, the equivalent of 150ml of fruit juice, per day. (Read more in our recent story about whether sugar really is bad for you).\n\nThe problem is that, with the fibre removed, fruit juice\u2019s fructose is absorbed more quickly. Sudden spikes in blood sugar cause the pancreas to release insulin to bring it back down to a stable level. Over time, this mechanism can wear out, increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In 2013, researchers analysed the health data of 100,000 people collected between 1986 and 2009 and found that fruit juice consumption was linked with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. They concluded that \u2013 since liquids pass through the stomach to the intestine faster than solids \u2013 even when the nutritional content is similar to whole fruit, fruit juice leads to faster and larger changes in glucose and insulin levels.\n\nAnother study found a relationship between fruit juice and type 2 diabetes after following the diets and diabetes status of more than 70,000 nurses over 18 years. The researchers explain that the possible reason for this may partly have been the lack of the other components found in whole fruit, like fibre.\n\nJuices containing vegetables can provide more nutrients and less sugar than juices made up of just fruit \u2013 but they still lack valuable fibre. Diets high in fibre have been linked to a lower risk of developing coronary heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure and diabetes, and it's recommended adults consume 30g per day.\n\nOverall excess\n\nAside from the link to type 2 diabetes, many studies agree that fruit juice is harmful if it contributes to an excess in calories.\n\nIn an analysis of 155 studies, John Sievenpiper, associate professor at the University of Toronto's Department of Nutritional Sciences, set out to understand if the associations between sugary soft drinks and health \u2013 including risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease \u2013 were applicable to the food and drink we generally consume as part of a healthy diet. He compared studies looking into the effects of fructose-containing sugars (including sucrose, high fructose corn syrup, honey and syrups) with control diets free from or lower in these sugars. His aim? To isolate the effects of consuming too many calories from the effects of foods containing different sugars.\n\nHe found negative effects to fasting blood sugar and insulin levels when food provided excess calories from sugars, including fruit juice. However, when the calories weren't in excess overall, there were some advantages to consuming whole fruit \u2013 and even fruit juice. Sievenpiper concludes that the recommended 150ml of fruit juice per day, which is an average serving, is reasonable.\n\nThe paper concluded that foods containing fructose may have some small benefits for long-term blood sugar control when they don\u2019t lead to over-consumption of calories. But when they do lead to too many calories, they risk raising blood sugar and insulin levels. This could be because fructose has a relatively low GI, the paper states, while high GI diets are associated with insulin resistance.\n\n\"Getting a whole fruit is better than fruit juice, but if you're going to use juice as a complement to fruits and vegetables, that's fine \u2013 however, not if you're using juice for hydration and drinking large amounts,\" Sievenpiper says.\n\nSo while we know that fruit juice can cause diabetes if it\u2019s part of a diet that\u2019s more calorific overall, it's less clear how juice affects the long-term health of those who aren't overweight.\n\n\"There's still a lot we don't understand about how having increased sugar in the diet without weight gain changes risk,\" says Heather Ferris, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Virginia. \"For how long and well the pancreas can keep up with the sugar is partly down to genetics.\"\n\nBut we have a higher risk of consuming more than the recommended daily number of calories (around 2,000 for women and 2,500 for men) on the days we drink juice, according to research. Numerous studies have shown that drinking fruit juice doesn't make us consume any less of other foods throughout the day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also easy to consume large amounts of fruit juice quite quickly, meaning extra calories. And when calories increase, this can contribute to weight gain,\u201d Elvin says.\n\nWith a twist\n\nBut one study published last year may have found a way to make juicing healthier. Researchers used a 'nutrient extractor\u2019 blender that, unlike traditional juicers, juices the whole fruit, including seeds and skin. They measured the effects of mixed fruit and peeled mango \u2013 both of which rank highly on the glycaemic index and therefore cause a spike in blood sugar \u2013 juiced in a nutrient extractor blender, compared with another group who ate the same fruit whole.\n\nThose who drank nutrient-extracted mixed fruit had a lower blood sugar increase compared with the whole mixed fruit group, while there were no differences between those who had mango juice and whole mango.\n\nHowever, this was a small study, and the researchers didn\u2019t compare their findings with juice made by any other method, such as squeezing out the juice and leaving the skin and seeds.\n\nGail Rees, senior lecturer in human nutrition at the University of Plymouth and researcher on the study, says the findings were probably caused by the fruit seeds contained in the juices. But she says it\u2019s difficult to offer clear advice from this study.\n\n\"I'd certainly go along with the current advice of 150ml of fruit juice per day, but if you do use a nutrient extractor at home, it could be keeping blood sugar levels relatively stable,\" she says.\n\nBut while keeping seeds in the juice may make some difference during digestion, Ferris argues this doesn't necessarily change how filling the juice is.\n\n\"When the juice includes some fibre it will slow down absorption, but you still have excess calorie intake because it's easy to consume. However, it's an improvement over traditional fruit juice,\" she says.\n\nOther ways we can improve the effects of fruit juice on our health include making sure we select ripe fruit to retain as much of its goodness as possible, according to Roger Clemens, professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Southern California.\n\nIt's also important to recognise that different juicing methods are better suited to different fruit because of their physical make-up, Clemens has found. For example, most of the phytonutrients in grapes are found in the seed, with very little found in the pulp. And most of the beneficial phenolic and flavonoid compounds found in oranges are located in the peel, which is lost with traditional juicing.\n\nDetox debunked\n\nAnother reason for fruit juice's recent popularity is the argument that it can help to detox the body.\n\nHowever, the only medically recognised use of the word \u2018detox\u2019 refers to removing harmful substances from the body, including drugs, alcohol and poison.\n\n\"The whole concept of a juice diet being detoxifying is a fallacy,\" says Clemens. \"We consume compounds every day that may be toxic and our bodies do a wonderful job of detoxing and eliminating everything we eat.\"\n\nAnd juice isn\u2019t a cure-all for getting your nutrients, either.\n\n\"There are a lot of nutrients contained in the parts of the fruits, such as in apple skins, that are excluded when you juice them,\u201d says Ferris. \u201cYou end up with sugary water with some vitamins.\"\n\nPlus, she adds, it\u2019s not an ideal way to reach the advised \u2018five a day\u2019. \"People try to get five servings of fruit and vegetables per day and don't realise this isn't just about getting vitamins,\u201d she says. \u201cIt's also about reducing the amount of grain carbs and protein and fats in our diet, and increasing fibre.\u201d So while fruit juice is better than no fruit at all, there are limits. It particularly comes with risks when we consume more than 150ml of free sugars per day, or when it puts us over our recommended calorie intake. It provides us with vitamins \u2013 but fruit juice is far from a quick fix.\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

      "Rossi Thomson"
    ],
    "text": "Had it not been for the sunny sky, I could have sworn that I was in Great Britain.\n\nThe high street was teeming with people, Union Jack flags were flapping in the wind, a slight aroma of fried cod tinged the air and the queens were waving to their starstruck subjects \u2013 Queen Elizabeth II from a gleaming car and her great-great-grandmother Victoria from underneath a lacy black parasol.\n\nSchio has always been known as \u2018the Manchester of Italy\u2019\n\nThe time and space continuum seemed to have been broken, thus bringing two of the most formidable British queens together in the same, rather unexpected place. For instead of London, I was in a small Northern Italian town called Schio (pronounced 'ski-o').\n\nThis was British Day Schio \u2013 a weekend extravaganza dedicated to Great Britain during which the citizens of Schio declare themselves British. They dress up as British characters from past and modern times and even publish a newspaper (the headline of which this year proudly stated: La Citta' Piu' Britannica d'Italia!, \u2018The Most British City in Italy!\u2019).\n\n\u201cSchio has always been known as \u2018the Manchester of Italy\u2019,\u201d said Claudio Canova, 51, a digital marketing specialist who conceived the idea for British Day Schio six years ago.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 The last velvet merchant of Venice\n\n\u2022 A piece of Britain lost in Mexico\n\n\u2022 A town that\u2019s more British than Britain\n\nThe reason behind Schio's moniker lies in the town's industrial history. Just like Manchester, Schio was once a major wool and textile production centre.\n\nNew wool-spinning and weaving technologies imported from England by the Venetian patrician Nicol\u00f2 Tron led to the creation in 1718 of an important wool mill in Schio. Tron was an entrepreneur, friend of British mathematician Isaac Newton and former ambassador of the Republic of Venice to the court of King George I. His attempts to introduce the English know-how to Venice were rebuffed by the Republic\u2019s influential textile corporations. So, Tron headed to Schio in the northern confines of the Republic. The town was a centuries-old wool-producing centre with cheap skilled labour, abundant raw materials and a license given to it by the Republic of Venice in 1701 to manufacture fine textiles independently of Venice\u2019s textile corporations. He employed nine English technicians who relocated to Schio with their families to work in Tron\u2019s new wool mill.\n\nSeveral decades later, Tron brought another English invention to the small Italian town: the flying shuttle.\n\nInvented by Lancashire-born machinist John Kay, the flying shuttle significantly sped up the weaving process, which increased productivity and reduced costs. It could also be mechanised, paving the way for the automatic looms.\n\nSchio soon became synonymous with high-quality textiles, which were exported all over Europe and beyond.\n\nIn the 19th Century, father-and-son duo Francesco and Alessandro Rossi (no relation to me) took Schio's textile production to new heights. Schio\u2019s Fabbrica Alta, built in 1862 by Alessandro, who was inspired by the vertical woollen mills found in Manchester and throughout Great Britain, was the largest industrial plant in 19th-Century Italy. Today it is considered the imposing symbol of Italy's first industrial revolution.\n\nAlthough now permanently closed, the Fabbrica Alta, with its tall body symmetrically dotted with 330 windows, is a testament to the close technological connection Schio has had with Manchester throughout the centuries, despite being almost 2,000km away.\n\n\u201cAdd to this Schio's rainy weather and the grumpy character of its citizens, and you have the most British town in Italy,\u201d Canova said.\n\nBritish Day Schio evolved from SchioLife, a British rock-themed music festival spearheaded by Canova. \u201cSince 2007, we have been organising concerts and had the opportunity to get in touch with many legendary musicians like Steve Hackett from Genesis, Sir Gary Brooker of Procol Harum, Rick Wakeman [the keyboardist of Yes] and Ian Anderson from Jethro Tull.\u201d\n\n\u201cI realised that we live in the most British town of Italy and then we had to do something to highlight these characteristics,\u201d Canova continued. \u201cI think that after six years we have succeeded.\u201d\n\nUnder the slogan of \u2018Spicy. Independent. Original.\u2019 \u2013 which according to Canova reflects the character of the citizens of Schio \u2013 British Day Schio has been enjoying an ever-increasing popularity since its inception. Held on the second weekend of October, the festival attracted more than 30,000 people in 2017. That year paid tribute to Oasis; the 2018 edition was in homage to Peter Gabriel.\n\nAdd to this Schio's rainy weather and the grumpy character of its citizens, and you have the most British town in Italy\n\n\u201cWe choose the artists to whom we dedicate British Day Schio each year based on the social values they transmit. Peter Gabriel is one of the champions for peace in the world and his message is important for everyone. The first three editions of the festival were dedicated, respectively, to The Beatles, The Phantom of the Opera and Pink Floyd,\u201d Canova explained.\n\n\u201cWho are you going to pay homage to next year?\u201d I asked, only too eager to throw some names in the hat. You know, the best of British. Like Pet Shop Boys, Duran Duran, Depeche Mode\u2026\n\nInstead, the 2019 festival will be dedicated to Alessandro Rossi as it will be 200 years since his birth.\n\nI arrived in Schio in the early afternoon on the day of the festival this past October. The central streets of the town were lined with grand buildings in shades of ochre, toffee and burnt orange. Ladies and gents strolled the pavements dressed in their best British-inspired costumes.\n\nThe window displays of the local shops sported copious amounts of British paraphernalia: biscuit tins in the Union Jack colours, British stamps, leaflets for the London Eye, postcards of the Queen, little flags with Harry and Meghan's happy faces. Throughout town, famous locations like Abbey Road and Carnaby Street had been recreated. Even the local gelateria had slapped a large sign saying \u2018Ice Cream\u2019 on its window.\n\n\u201cFrom the youngest to the oldest, the citizens of Schio love this event,\u201d Canova told me. \u201cBritish Day Schio attracts thousands of people, dressed up in British-style attire or as famous characters such as Harry Potter, James Bond, Dr Who, Sherlock Holmes. They talk in English on the streets as if it were normal. They enter the shops and ask for things in English, greet people with \u2018Hi!\u2019, \u2018Hello!\u2019, and \u2018Good morning!\u2019.\u201d\n\nAnd it is all done without irony \u2013 a genuine expression both of an appreciation for Great Britain and Schio's own industrial past.\n\n\u201cWhat will happen with British Day Schio after Brexit? Will you continue organising it?\u201d I asked Canova.\n\n\u201cCertamente!\u201d he replied. \u201cOf course, we will continue to organise it. Indeed, with even bigger resolve.\u201d\n\nManchester doesn\u2019t know about British Day Schio yet. Canova\u2019s plan is to contact the British city in the near future and build a relationship based on the historical link between the two cities.\n\n\u201cWill Brexit change how Schio feels about Britain?\u201d I pressed.\n\n\u201cNo, absolutely no,\u201d he replied earnestly. \u201cI think that the British citizens are historically always ahead compared to the rest of Europe and perhaps the world. I believe that the British people only want to defend their state from economic [and] financial invasions and not from the European citizens.\u201d\n\nLater that day, I headed to the large terrace in front of Schio's St Pietro Cathedral. From there I could see the main piazza below me filled with hundreds of people waiting for the festival\u2019s centrepiece \u2013 the British Day Schio parade \u2013 to begin. Beyond the rooftops, I could see the cragged peaks of the Little Dolomites.\n\nA rousing rendition of Scotland the Brave filled the air. There was nothing to betray that the musicians \u2013 dressed in kilts and skilfully handling their bagpipes \u2013 were not from Scotland but from the nearby Italian city of Vicenza. A long procession of historic British cars followed. They were beautiful and shiny, representing the British technological and design advances through the decades.\n\nI think that the British citizens are historically always ahead compared to the rest of Europe and perhaps the world\n\nSuddenly the crowd surged forward, eager to see something that was beyond my line of sight. Straining my neck, I glimpsed a gleaming open-top vehicle surrounded by four guards with bearskin hats.\n\n\u201cIt's the Queen!\u201d I shouted in delight.\n\nResplendent and with a posy in hand, 'Queen Elizabeth II' was taking in the adoration of the crowd, bestowing upon us one of her trademark waves every now and then.\n\nYou had to hand it to the organisers of British Day Schio. They\u2019d managed to make even me \u2013 a Bulgarian totally uninterested in all things royal \u2013 giddy with excitement at the sight of the Queen.\n\nWhile there is no shortage of festivals in Italy, British Day Schio is in a league of its own. Residents had adopted little bits and pieces of British culture and somehow managed to put them together in a red, white and blue puzzle held together by the pride in their own Italian town and its industrial history.\n\nMost remarkably, the citizens of Schio had managed to master the notoriously hard-to-grasp British humour. You just had to look at the British Day Schio's newspaper where, in small red letters, it said: \u201cThe parade is to be held even in good weather!\u201d.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Miriam hid her sexuality from her strict Muslim parents for years. When she eventually did come out to them, she found it impossible to translate \"lesbian\" into Punjabi or Urdu. She explains how the conversation put an end to her double life \"playing the straight woman\" but caused a rift so deep that her father disowned her.\n\n\"I always knew I was attracted to the same gender - as young as four or five, when I kissed my best friend in the cloakroom, I knew then.\n\n\"But it wasn't until I was in college that I first started exploring. We got the internet at home and there was a dial-up computer in my brother's room - it had a lock on the door.\n\n\"I used to go on Yahoo chat, I remember sometimes I pretended I was a man, for the sake of speaking to women. Then from 18, 19, I [thought], 'maybe I need to look for lesbian women'.\"\n\nMiriam* grew up in a traditional Muslim family in Bristol where her grandfather \"ruled the roost\", with Islamic sermons and prayers five times a day.\n\nDespite knowing from a young age she was gay, she knew telling her parents would cause a rift that might prove insurmountable. She went to great lengths to hide it but found an outlet in which to explore her sexuality by speaking to women in chat rooms.\n\nIt was only when she went to university that she built up the courage to meet other women in person, travelling hundreds of miles so she wouldn't be seen by anyone she knew.\n\n\"I went as far as Manchester or Hartlepool, as long as it was a minimum of two hours away.\n\n\"I was absolutely [terrified] of having a relationship with someone in the same city as me. These scenarios used to play through my mind - what if someone sees me at the station?\"\n\nFearful as she was of being caught out, these relationships gave Miriam freedom.\n\n\"I made sure that my girlfriends didn't visibly mark me, so I didn't come home with [love bites] on my neck. But while I was there, it was thrilling - I thought, 'Oh my god, I'm doing this, I'm having a sexual experience with another woman, this is amazing'.\n\n\"At the time, the people I met didn't question the fact it was long distance. One woman in particular I only saw every other month. I used to go up on the train, meet for a few hours, go to a pub, have some food. We were quite open, it felt massively liberating.\"\n\nSome went on for much longer: for a year she went to Burnley, near Manchester, to visit a Muslim woman who was married with a child.\n\n\"I used to stay in the B&B down the road. Her husband worked nights and at 18:30 he would go to work and I'd go through the back door. I'd set an alarm for 05:30 and go out the back door again. It was ridiculous. Her family knew of me but I was a 'friend who was visiting'.\n\n\"It didn't occur to them I could have been a sexual partner and her husband never caught me. There was a naivety to it all, I didn't think it was my problem to bear because I was so used to living this closeted life. Even thinking about it now chokes me up, because I think, 'how did I do that?'\"\n\nUnder the guise of friendship, Miriam did, on one occasion, take her lover home to her parents' house in Bristol.\n\n\"She was Muslim - if it was anyone else but her, it would have been difficult. But because she looked Asian it was easier [to explain her presence] than [bringing home] a white girlfriend. She had the cultural and religious understanding - she knew how to behave.\n\n\"My room had two beds it, my parents never came in my room anyway so we slept in the same bed. We were exploring this new world, it was amazing and refreshing. In some ways it was so easy, it was almost a relief.\n\n\"But it was so whirlwind, she had to leave - her plans were premade for her and she went home to Saudi Arabia. It was heartbreaking, knowing we were so close to something so perfect.\"\n\nYou might also be interested in\n\nGay, Muslim and living with HIV\n\nThe gamer who spent seven years in his dressing gown\n\nThe last man standing on an island\n\nAt 21, Miriam and her then partner got engaged. She knew she wanted to tell her mum about this \"massive thing\" but knew it would cause pain.\n\n\"Her words were that she never thought any child of hers could bring her as much shame as I did. And since then it's very much been about religion. She'd reply, 'God made man and woman - if you look at any verse in the Koran it's never husband and husband or wife and wife'.\n\n\"It resonated with me, because I realised how much she was in a bubble - for her to not even [know] about homosexuality. But her overarching love for her daughter fights with her culture. She worries about me because she believes the life I'm living is a sin. I can tell when I look at her face that she's hurting.\"\n\nMiriam said their relationship became very strained and for six months after, every time they spoke there was \"shouting, screaming and crying\". She stopped going home as much and feels like their relationship has never recovered, but her mum agreed to keep it a secret. It was more than a decade before Miriam told her father. She and her current partner had recently got engaged and she decided the time was right to tell him.\n\n\"There's no direct translation for gay, lesbian, bisexual in Punjabi or in Urdu that I know of, so I basically said 'of that with you and mum' - to liken it to a relationship.\n\n\"He said: 'You know Islam, you've gone to the mosque, you've read the Koran, you know it's a sin don't you? As far as I'm concerned, I'm right, you're wrong. What you're doing is against Islam'.\"\n\nMiriam said her father presented her with a choice; give up her partner and return to the family home, or drop off her keys and never show her face again.\n\n\"He basically said he didn't want anything to do with me and disowned me.\"\n\nHe initially prevented her mother from seeing her, even though she still wanted to have contact. They have managed to see each other occasionally at her sister's house, but Miriam admits she has given up wanting to change how her mum feels.\n\n\"When you strip away religion, culture and feelings, you just have to think 'she's my mum, and I'm her daughter', and that's all that is left. When I was younger, it was 'I'm right, she's wrong'. It was black and white, but now it's grey. She's right in how she feels, and I'm right in how I feel.\"\n\nAs for her father, Miriam recently saw him at a family gathering with other relatives who don't know about her sexuality.\n\n\"I used that opportunity to be normal with him. When he was about to leave for work I went up to him and gave him a big hug. He was rigid, but I stayed there for an extra 10 seconds to have that extra contact because I bloody miss him.\n\n\"I could either do what he said on that day [and leave], or I could keep testing the waters and that's [what I'm going to do].\"\n\nIn Islam, as in many Christian denominations and in Orthodox Judaism, homosexuality is seen as a sin. While there have been moves towards acceptance of homosexuality in some religions, Islam in the West has tended to stay with the Orthodox view.\n\nMiriam and her partner, who is white British, hope to marry in 2020. She plans to wear traditional dress for part of it and there \"may be a few Asian tunes\". But the rest will be \"as gay as gay can be\" - with a drag act as compere and DJ.\n\nIn the meantime, the 35-year-old is focusing her efforts on a group she has founded that she hopes will become \"a safe space\" for Muslim LGBT+ people to meet without fear of discrimination.\n\n\"I think Islam itself is a very closed off religion. If you look at some older members of the community, they are living in the 8th Century, not the 21st. But it is possible to be Muslim and gay. I genuinely believe that although I had a girlfriend earlier in life, I wasn't out to myself. I feel not just stronger now after having those experiences, but more accepting of myself.\"\n\n*Miriam's name has been changed\n\nAs told to Jonathan Holmes\n\nIllustrations by Katie Horwich"

    "text": "The late Swedish academic Hans Rosling has identified a worrying trend: not only do many people across advanced economies have no idea that the world is becoming a much better place, but they actually even think the opposite. This is no wonder, when the news focuses on reporting catastrophes, terrorist attacks, wars and famines.\n\nWho wants to hear about the fact that every day some 200,000 people around the world are lifted above the $2-a-day poverty line? Or that more than 300,000 people a day get access to electricity and clean water for the first time every day? These stories of people in low-income countries simply doesn\u2019t make for exciting news coverage. But, as Rosling pointed out in his book Factfulness, it\u2019s important to put all the bad news in perspective.\n\nWhile it is true that globalisation has put some downward pressure on middle-class wages in advanced economies in recent decades, it has also helped lift hundreds of millions of people above the global poverty line \u2013 a development that has mostly occurred in South-East Asia.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s a problem with the way we define inequality\n\n\u2022 The secret behind successful countries\n\n\u2022 What if the state provided everyone with a basic income?\n\nThe recent rise of populism that has swept across Western countries with Trump, Brexit, and the election of populists in Hungary and Italy, among various other factors, is thus of great concern if we care about global welfare. Globalisation is the only way forward to ensure that economic prosperity is shared among all countries and not only a select few advanced economies.\n\nWhile some people glorify the past, one of the big facts of economic history is that until quite recently a significant part of the world population has lived under quite miserable conditions \u2013 and this has been true throughout most of human history.\n\nThe following seven charts show how the world has become a much better place compared to just a few decades ago. (Click on the images to expand the charts in your browser).\n\n1: Life expectancy continues to rise\n\nEven during the Industrial Revolution, average life expectancy across European countries did not exceed around 35 years. This does not imply that most people died in their late 30s or even 40s, since it was mostly very high levels of child mortality rates that pulled down the average. Women dying in childbirth was obviously a big problem too. So were some common diseases such as smallpox and the plague, for example, which now have been completely eradicated in high-income countries. (Read more about what life expectancy really means and how it has changed in our recent BBC Future story).\n\n2: Child mortality continues to fall\n\nMore than a century ago, child mortality rates were still exceeding 10% \u2013 even in high-income countries such as the US and the UK. But thanks to modern medicine, and better public safety in general, this number has been reduced to almost zero in rich countries.\n\nPlus, developing economies like India and Brazil now have much lower child mortality rates today than advanced economies had at similar income levels about one century ago.\n\n3. Fertility rates are falling\n\nEven though many are concerned about the global population explosion, the fact is that fertility rates have fallen significantly across the globe. UN population estimates largely expect the global population to stabilise at about 11 billion by the end of this century.\n\nMoreover, as can be seen from these charts, many developing countries such as Brazil, China and a number of African nations have already switched to a low-fertility regime. While this transition took many advanced economies almost 100 years, starting with the Industrial Revolution, many others have since achieved this over just two to three decades.\n\n4. GDP growth has accelerated in developed countries\n\nTechnological leaders, the US and Western Europe, have been growing at about 2% per year, on average, for the past 150 years. This means that real income levels roughly double every 36 years.\n\nWhile there were many long-lasting ups and downs, like the Great Depression or the recent Great Recession, the constancy of the long-run growth rate is actually quite miraculous. Low-income countries, including China and India, have been growing at a significantly faster pace in recent decades and are quickly catching up to the West. A 10% growth rate over a prolonged period means that income levels double roughly every seven years. It is obviously good news if prosperity is more shared across the globe.\n\n5. Global income inequality has gone down\n\nMax Roser, CC BY-SA\n\nWhile inequality within countries has gone up as a result of globalisation, global inequality has been on a steady downward trend for several decades. This is mostly a result of developing countries such as China and India where hundreds of millions of people have seen their living standards improve. In fact, for the first time ever since the Industrial Revolution, about half of the global population can be considered global middle class.\n\nThroughout most of human history people lived under oppressive non-democratic regimes. As of today, about half of the human population is living in a democracy. Out of those still living in autocracies, 90% are in China. While the country has recently moved in the other direction, there is reason to believe that continued economic development might eventually lead to democratisation (according to modernisation theory).\n\n6.

Conflicts are on the decline\n\nThroughout history, the world has been riven by conflict. In fact, at least two of the world\u2019s largest powers have been at war with each other more than 50% of the time since about 1500.\n\nWhile the early 20th Century was especially brutal with two world wars in rapid succession, the post-war period has been very peaceful. For the first time ever, there has been no war or conflict in Western Europe in about three generations. And international organisations including the EU and the UN have led to a more stable world.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Conversation, and is republished under a Creative Commons licence.\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

Most of the youngsters in their care are victims of bush meat hunts which sees adults killed for food and babies sold in the illegal pet trade.\n\nJenny and Jim Desmond. Co-founders of Liberia Chimpanzee Rescue & Protection \u00a9 LCRP\n\n\u201cEvery one of the chimps has lost their mothers, minimum, and generally they will have also lost family members because whatever adults are in the group at the time of the hunt will be killed and any of the babies will be taken,\u201d says Jenny.\n\nShe says all the chimps that come into their care arrive severely traumatised and injured.\n\nThe Desmonds have been involved with great ape and primate sanctuaries for almost 20 years, but what brought them to Liberia takes a little explaining.\n\nThe chimps that come into their care are often traumatised and require around-the-clock care \u00a9 LCRP\n\nIn the 1970s, Liberia hosted an American medicial research project testing hepatitis vaccines on chimpanzees. After the 30-year study closed, with the chimps too used to human contact, there was no way to release the former subjects into the wild. They were rehomed on a group of small river islands and were given food and water daily.\n\nBut 10 years later, the funding to care for the chimpanzees ran out and it began to look like they would be left to starve. This is when a group of foundations lead by the Humane Society of the United States stepped in to raise money and awareness.\n\nThe Desmonds were brought over in July 2015 to takeover care of the 66 remaining chimpanzees. What was only meant to be a month of crisis management grew into something completely different.\n\nSoon after they arrived, as word of the sanctuary spread, new chimps started coming into their care - 13 within the 18 months. Today, they look after 34 chimps, with 32 under the age of 6 years.\n\n'Any animal in our house is part of our family' \u00a9 LCRP\n\nJim says it\u2019s important to simulate what the chimps\u2019 lives would be like in the wild. That means 24-hour care until the age of 2.5 years like they would get with their mothers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re literally attached to you. They sleep with us, they sleep in the bed with us, they go with us everywhere,\u201d says Jenny. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty crazy, you have a chimp attached to you pretty much all the time, if not more than one.\u201d\n\nThe Desmonds\u2019 chimp family continues to grow. They are trying to relocate to new facilities in 40 hectares of forest giving the chimps an even more natural life.\n\n\u201cAny animal in our house is part of our family, regardless of the species. But with the chimps they\u2019re so much like humans it really is like you have children,\u201d says Jill.\n\nIntroducing the BBC Earth Podcast\n\nBBC Earth presents a podcast the size of a planet, telling stories about nature, science and our human experience.\n\nSubscribe wherever you get your podcasts:\n\nBy Kara Segedin\n\nFeatured image by Liberia Chimpanzee Rescue and Protection"

I\u2019d worked doing social media and marketing for different charities and well-known brands, but I couldn\u2019t shift the feeling that I was a small cog and that I had more to give. Then, one day, everything came to a head. It was the day MP Jo Cox was brutally murdered. Reading the news about her death sucker-punched me and that night, I broke down. It might sound extreme but I was feeling increasingly unsettled and I guess the tragedy of that day jolted my perspective.

    "text": "Even before I saw the water, I heard the rumble. Sounding like a river or a waterfall, the noise was gently muffled by the sword ferns and step moss as it reverberated through the sky-scraping red cedars and Douglas firs. What I was hearing was not a river, and if I\u2019d come along this trail an hour earlier or later, I\u2019d have heard nothing at all.\n\nI was visiting the Skookumchuck Narrows, one of Canada\u2019s most famous tidal rapids, which are located a ferry ride north-west of Vancouver at the head of Sechelt Inlet on the Sunshine Coast. On a 3m tide as much as 760,000,000 cubic metres of water passes through the narrows, creating imposing white-water rapids that diminish to calm water four times a day as the tide turns. But the reason I was here was not to marvel at the daring kayakers as they surfed the standing waves. Instead, I had come to ask about the name of the place.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 A 500-year-old fight to save a language\n\n\u2022 A language people don\u2019t want to speak\n\n\u2022 Australia\u2019s ancient language shaped by sharks\n\nLike many from British Columbia, I grew up with an easy familiarity with a handful of strange words. They were terms I always thought were common English, but they turned out to be unknown beyond the boundaries of my Pacific Coast home. I later learned that words like potlatch, saltchuck, kanaka, skookum, sticks, muckamuck, tyee and cultus were from a near-forgotten language that was once spoken by more than 100,000 people, from Alaska to the California border, for almost 200 years.\n\nKnown as Chinook Jargon or Chinook Wawa (\u2018wawa\u2019 meaning talk), this was a trade, or pidgin, language that combined simplified words from the First Nations languages of Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka), Chinook and others, as well as from French and English. It was used so extensively that it was the language of courts and newspapers in the Pacific Northwest from about 1800 to 1905. Some Chinook Wawa still exists in place names and slang, but the meanings are so deeply buried in Pacific Northwest culture that the words come with more of a feeling than a definition, and most residents can\u2019t say which language the terms evolved from.\n\nCurious what these visitors to the Skookumchuck Narrows might know about the site\u2019s name, I waited for a Vancouver kayaker named Jill to step away from the furious water, then asked if she knew what Skookum means. Almost in chorus, an entire crowd of kayakers answered. \u201cIt means awesome. Big and awesome.\u201d And chuck, I asked? \u201cThat\u2019s the ocean,\u201d they replied.\n\nThey\u2019re not entirely correct \u2013 historically, skookum meant strong or impressive, and chuck meant water (saltchuck meant the sea), but once words become part of a local lingo they can change with time. When I asked if they knew where the word Skookumchuck comes from, there was a puzzled silence. Finally Jill answered. \u201cI think it comes from here,\u201d she said, gesturing toward the rocky cliffs and dense green forest.\n\nThe birth of a new language\n\nChinook Wawa was developed to ease trade in a place where there was no common language. On the Pacific Coast at the time, there were dozens of First Nations languages, including Haida, Tlingit, Tsimshian, Nuu-chah-nulth, Haisla, Heiltsuk, Kwakwaka'wakw, Salishan and Chinook. After European contact, which included Captain Cook\u2019s arrival in 1778, English, French, Spanish, Hawaiian, Chinese, Japanese and Portuguese were gradually added to the mix.\n\nWhile pidgin languages usually draw most of their vocabulary from the prestige language, or colonising culture, unusually, in the case of Chinook Wawa, two thirds of the language is Chinook and Nuu-chah-nulth with the rest being made up mostly of English and French.\n\nThere are a few different theories about how Chinook Wawa arose. Some say it existed between linguistically different First Nations groups long before European contact.\n\nOthers put its development in the hands of Captain Cook: after his 1778 visit to the west coast of Vancouver Island, the Nuu-chah-nulth words he recorded were sent back to England and subsequently used by European traders on the Pacific Coast. Almost 30 years later and 425km south, explorers Lewis and Clark encountered these Nuu-chah-nulth words being spoken as part of the trade language in the home region of the Chinook people, present day Oregon\u2019s Columbia River Valley.\n\nStill other experts say Chinook Wawa was developed by the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company to be used as the common language of the fur trade.\n\nIf you were coming as a missionary, a businessman or for the Fraser Canyon gold rush, you needed two things: warm clothes and a Chinook Jargon dictionary\n\nBut retired University of British Columbia professor and anthropological linguist Jay Powell believes Chinook Wawa developed more organically than this. Powell, who is one of the last fluent speakers of Chinook Wawa, points to the women and children who settled on the Columbia River after the first forts were established in the early 1800s. He explained that many of the European settlers in the area had indigenous wives from a variety of different First Nations. These women and their children rarely shared a common language with their husbands or their neighbours, he said, so the linguistically simple Chinook Wawa became the language of the region.\n\n\u201cDuring the time of settlement, everyone knew this,\u201d Powell told me, \u201cIf you were coming as a missionary, a businessman or for the Fraser Canyon gold rush, you needed two things: warm clothes and a Chinook Jargon dictionary.\u201d\n\nUsed by First Nations people, traders, immigrants, missionaries and their children, over the next several decades, Chinook Wawa expanded, progressing from a few hundred words to a more complex language capable of conveying jokes and even an opera called Keel-a-Pie (Come Back). By the time England and the US partitioned the Northwest in 1846, the language had followed the retreat of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company from Fort Vancouver on the present-day border of Oregon and Washington to Fort Victoria on Vancouver Island and further north.\n\nA sampling of Chinook Wawa Boston: American Boston wawa: the American-English dialect Chuck: water, liquid Skookumchuck: big water or fast water Saltchuck: salt water, the ocean Cultus: bad, worthless, nothing, broken, unworthy Kanaka: Hawaiian person Mowich: deer Muckamuck: food, to eat Potlatch: to give, gift Siwash: man, a male Skookum: big, mighty, strong, true, genuine, solid Sticks: to do with trees, or somewhere in the bush or forest Tyee: chief\n\nChinook Wawa was reaching its peak in the 1860s when the Hastings Sawmill on Burrard Inlet became the birthplace of Vancouver. The managers spoke Chinook Wawa, and Chinese and Japanese immigrants who worked at the mill learned the pidgin language rather than English. Further inland, the Kamloops Wawa newspaper provided the news of the day in English, French and Chinook Wawa from 1891 through 1905.\n\nSearching for the lost language\n\nThe new language never did take over. The forces that brought an end to Chinook Wawa were numerous: smallpox and other epidemics decimated the First Nations populations; residential boarding schools for First Nations children destroyed much of the indigenous culture that was left; and the new government brought institutionalised racism, establishing English as the dominant culture and language. Not long after, the young men who used Chinook Wawa to talk, sing and joke were called off to World War One.\n\nBy 1962, it is estimated the remaining Chinook Wawa speakers numbered only 100.\n\nBut the language left a mark. When I started to research the musical sounding words I recalled from my childhood, Powell cautioned me that it was important to get the story of Chinook Wawa right.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing transcendent about Chinook Wawa,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s part of our history, it enriches our present. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nBecause it\u2019s part of our history, it enriches our present\n\nBut former Vancouver mayor, and self-taught Chinook Wawa speaker, Sam Sullivan, says the language helped shape what British Columbia became. \u201cWe were a new kind of place \u00ad\u2013 and it was reflected in the egalitarian language we\u2019d created together. We had a mixed-race governor, James Douglas, who was married to a First Nations woman. Their daughter Martha spoke and wrote in Chinook Wawa.\u201d\n\nBy learning and teaching Chinook Wawa, Sullivan hopes to recapture and understand some of the forces that first created the province. \u201cIt\u2019s the best artefact we have to prove that we didn\u2019t start as a racist place,\u201d he told me.\n\nToday, some of the last traces of Chinook Wawa can be found in our landscape. As I visit sites, many in what would be called \u2018the sticks\u2019, or forest, in Chinook Wawa, I\u2019m brought back to early memories of my family heading out on the saltchuck to fish for halibut or salmon. I\u2019m not sure when I learned the steel-blue ocean, with its white-shell midden beaches and misty forests, is only called the saltchuck in the Pacific Northwest \u2013 and even then only by old-timers. But I do know when I hear the word it conjures a feeling of rugged self-sufficiency and a particular scent of brine.\n\nLike many First Nations place names, Chinook Wawa names typically translate to simple descriptions. But some of them feel like mysteries. At Cultus Lake, I pondered what it was about the popular recreational site that once caused the lake to be named \u2018bad\u2019 or \u2018worthless\u2019. When I exited a winding trail above Siwash Rock in Vancouver\u2019s Stanley Park, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder who gave the dramatic sea stack a name derived from the French term for wild (sauvage), a word that went on to become a derogatory term for indigenous people.\n\nThe powerful Skookumchuck makes sense to me. But the historical gold rush town of Boston Bar has nothing to do with Boston or a bar, and instead means Americans sought gold on this section of the Fraser River, as most fur trade-era Americans were Boston traders. At Mowich Creek, when I think I catch sight of one of the deer it was named for, I feel for a moment the echoes of whoever came before me and named this tiny Pemberton Valley trickle of water.\n\nThe name lets people experience a connection to the land from another point of view\n\n\u201cPeople say how romantic our place names sound, and are always disappointed when I tell them they\u2019re descriptions that mean \u2018big water\u2019, \u2018shaped like a hummingbird beak\u2019, or \u2018purple flowers grow here\u2019,\u201d said Erik Blaney a business owner and tour operator from the Tla'amin First Nation. He tells me that people are always after a story; \u201csomething with a great creator or full moon.\u201d\n\nBlaney does believe the old names have power though, and that they should be understood. \u201cKnowing a place had a name before it was ever \u2018discovered\u2019 should be enough to see it in a new way. The name lets people experience a connection to the land from another point of view.\u201d\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

    "text": "The popularity of vegan foods continues to grow, with January seen as a traditional time to consider giving them a try.\n\nMilk alternatives, such as oat, soy, almond or coconut, are one area of interest, with sales rising in the UK.\n\nA scientific study suggests the greenhouse gas emissions used in the production of plant-based milks are lower than for dairy milk.\n\nBut which milk has the smallest impact on the planet?\n\nLooking at the global averages illustrated in the chart below, producing a glass of dairy milk results in almost three times the greenhouse gas emissions of any non-dairy milks, according to a University of Oxford study.\n\nLooking at land use, the difference is starker still.\n\nProducing a glass of dairy milk every day for a year requires 650 sq m (7,000 sq ft) of land, the equivalent of two tennis courts and more than 10 times as much as the same amount of oat milk, according to this study.\n\nAlmond milk requires more water to produce than soy or oat milk. A single glass requires 74 litres (130 pints of water) - more than a typical shower. Rice milk is also comparatively thirsty, requiring 54 litres of water per glass.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that both almond and rice milk still require less water to produce than the typical glass of dairy milk.\n\nWhere something is produced can mean there is a variation in its impact on the climate, see the chart below on dairy milk. On a more local level, sourcing products made close to home may result in a smaller carbon footprint than products that have had to be transported a long way.\n\nThe graphic below takes into account emissions from farming and in addition it includes transportation, packing and processing. Where livestock feed has had an impact on deforestation, this figure has also been included.\n\nTo find out the climate impact of what you eat and drink, choose from one of the 34 items in our calculator and pick how often you have it.\n\nHow do your food choices impact on the environment?

You can read more about how it was made at the foot of this page. Read more about it here. If you cannot view the food calculator, click to launch the interactive content.\n\nDesign by Prina Shah, development by Felix Stephenson and Becky Rush.\n\nFood production is responsible for a quarter of all human-produced greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming, according to the study on which the calculator is based, by Joseph Poore, of the University of Oxford.\n\nThe research found meat and other animal products were responsible for most food-related greenhouse gas emissions, despite providing only a fifth of the calories consumed.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nPeople tend to underestimate the greenhouse gas emissions from food, and dairy milk is no exception, according to research by Dr Adrian Camilleri, a psychologist at the University of Technology Sydney.\n\n\"The greenhouse gas emissions from milk are about 30 times higher than what people estimate,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"I suspect that most consumers underestimate the greenhouse gas emissions saved by switching from dairy milk to plant-based milk such as soy milk.\"\n\nSales of so-called alternative milks are growing faster in the UK than sales of traditional milk, according to market researchers Mintel.\n\nSearches for milk alternatives spike in January in the UK - especially soy milk and almond milk.\n\nOat milk companies have recently entered the UK market, giving the drink a boost in search interest. No other country in the world has had higher search interest in oat milk than the UK in the past 12 months.\n\nLast year, a record 50,000 people signed up to the Veganuary campaign to live without animal products for a month. But the growing popularity of veganism extends beyond January. Searches for veganism have doubled in the past year.\n\nSo to what extent do plant-based diets' trendiness translate to actual numbers?\n\nThere are about 540,000 vegans in the UK, according to a 2016 survey by the Vegan Society, estimated to be up from 150,000 in 2006.\n\nYet, some farming bodies are critical of the idea of Veganuary.\n\nThe campaign ignores the fact sheep farming in the UK \"works very much in harmony with our environment, our landscapes, and our human ecology\", according to the National Sheep Association.\n\nRed meat from livestock raised on grass was different from intensive animal farming, said chief executive Phil Stocker.\n\n\"Some people seem hell bent on portraying sheep as a global enemy - but in fact they are the ultimate in renewable technology and are an efficient form of productive land management that is planet-friendly,\" he added.\n\nHow did we make the calculator?\n\nHow is the environmental impact calculated?\n\nUniversity of Oxford researcher Joseph Poore, and Thomas Nemecek of the Agroecology and Environment Research Division in Zurich, Switzerland, looked at the environmental impact of 40 major food products that represent the vast majority of what is eaten globally.\n\nThey assessed the effect of these foods on climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of land and fresh water used across all stages of their production, including processing, packaging, and transportation, but excluding the cooking process.\n\nBy analysing data from nearly 40,000 farms, 1,600 processors, packaging types and retailers, Poore and Nemecek were able to assess how different production practices and geographies have very different consequences on the planet.\n\nWhat about serving sizes?\n\nThe data in the study looked at the environmental impact for 1kg of each of the different food products.\n\nFor this story, these were converted to impact per serving sizes based on serving sizes from the British Dietetic Association (BDA) and healthy diet portion sizes from BUPA.\n\nThe figures for serving sizes based on the BDA and BUPA suggestions are often lower than portion sizes commonly found in restaurants and what people normally expect, so the figures returned by the calculator on the impact of individuals' consumption are likely to be higher in reality.\n\nProtein-rich foods were calculated using the impact per 100g of protein from Poore and Nemecek's research and data on protein per serving from the BDA, to avoid differences between cooked and uncooked foods.\n\nDairy, soy and almond milks were set to 3.3% protein, while rice and oat were standardised based on their lower protein content.\n\nWhat are greenhouse gases?\n\nThe figures for greenhouse gas emissions are in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq). This is a unit that converts the impact of different kinds of greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide.\n\nHow do you know what my diet is equal to in miles driven?\n\nThe annual impact from eating a specific food is calculated by multiplying the impact of one serving of that food by the times it is eaten in a year, based on the weekly estimates submitted by the user.\n\nThese are then compared with the emissions of other daily habits. The European Environment Agency estimates that driving a regular petrol car produces 392g of CO2eq/mile over its entire lifecycle, including emissions from the vehicle's production, fuel production and exhaust emissions per mile.\n\nHeating the average UK home produces 2.34 tonnes of CO2eq annually, according to data from the Committee on Climate Change, and a passenger's carbon footprint for a return flight from London to Malaga is 320kg CO2eq, based on figures from the Carbon Neutral calculator.\n\nThe land used to produce the annual consumption of each food is compared with the size of a double tennis court, 261 metres squared.\n\nThe annual amount of water used is compared with a shower, based on figures suggesting the average shower lasts eight minutes and uses up 65 litres. Only \"blue water\", i.e. water taken out of rivers or the ground, is included in the data.\n\nUpdate 22nd February 2019: This article has been updated to include more detail about the methodology used. A chart has also been added showing the environmental impact of cow's milk, broken down by region."

    "text": "Picture this: you\u2019re in a filled-to-capacity stadium with around 75,000 other people, and pretty much everyone is singing. It\u2019s not a pop song, but a hymn; and you\u2019re not at a concert, but a rugby match. But then this is not hypothetical; it\u2019s reality, just a regular match day at the Principality Stadium in the Welsh capital of Cardiff.\n\nSinging is in my people as sight is in the eye\n\nYou see, Welsh people are known to have two great passions \u2013 rugby and singing \u2013 and when they congregate for a rugby match, you won\u2019t be able to stop them breaking into song. If anything, it\u2019s encouraged, helped by the fact that a choir will be on the pitch pre-match, at half-time and post-match to guide the crowd through the customary Welsh rugby repertoire \u2013 a series of traditional hymns (Calon L\u00e2n, Cwm Rhonnda, Gwahoddiad) that you may also hear at a standard Welsh wedding or funeral around the country.\n\nI\u2019ve lived outside of my homeland of Wales for nearly a third of my life now, but it wasn\u2019t until last year that I\u2019ve ever felt homesick \u2013 not for my actual home, rather that sense of shared history, identity and nostalgia. The Welsh, coincidentally, have a word for it: hiraeth. It doesn\u2019t have a direct translation into English, but means a soulful yearning for your homeland (of Wales). The truth is, I don\u2019t meet many Welsh people in London, where I now live. Without actually moving back home, I did the only thing I knew that would put me in touch with fellow Welshies: I looked for a Welsh choir.\n\nChoirs and choral singing are in our history, and you can find Welsh choirs across the globe, from Sydney to Boston, so it seemed inevitable that I would come across one in London. A quick Google search revealed at least five. Turning up to the Borough Welsh Chapel near London Bridge on a glum-looking Tuesday evening in September, I was transported home. Greeted by around 40 people of different ages singing with gusto some rather familiar songs (Hello Cwm Rhondda and Calon L\u00e2n again), and continuing the songs in the local pub afterwards, I felt as if I were back at one of my family\u2019s parties.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 Did Syria create the world\u2019s first song?\n\n\u2022 The country that cuddles with a purpose\n\n\u2022 Why people think Germans aren\u2019t funny\n\nA line from the 1941 Oscar-winning adaptation of Richard Llewellyn\u2019s novel How Green Was My Valley, a story about a Welsh mining community at the turn of the 20th century, reads: \u201cSinging is in my people as sight is in the eye\u201d. And this is true; we as a nation grow up singing in school, at parties, in church. We even compete in the National Eisteddfod, the largest festival of competitive poetry and music in Europe. Singing is part of Welsh identity and tradition \u2013 but why?\n\nThe bardic tradition of the eisteddfod (the name given to a festival of poetry and music) can be traced back to the 12th Century. At this time, music and poetry had great cultural significance, with folk traditions enabling stories to be told and recanted down the generations. Singing and reciting poetry (sometimes to music, when it is known as cerdd dant in Welsh) was often part of this and still plays a prominent role in the modern eisteddfod.\n\nIt is likely these traditions were also influenced by the lyrical nature of the Welsh language. Prof Gareth Williams, emeritus history professor at the University of South Wales acknowledges that \u201cthe consonantal nature of the [Welsh] language, like Italian and German, lends itself to clearly articulated expression.\u201d In fact, Welsh was apparently used as the basis for the Elvish language in JRR Tolkien\u2019s The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings partly due to its melodic, ethereal nature.\n\nFast-forward to the 18th Century and we see Wales really lay the foundation for its label as the \u2018Land of Song\u2019. The influx of migrants to Wales from the British countryside and abroad, seeking work in the ever-expanding coal and iron industries, saw huge population increases to the country. New non-conformist chapels were also being built at an astonishing rate due to the revival of the Methodist movement of the Anglican Church that was popularised by leading Welsh preachers of the time. This creation of new communities caused singing to become even more prominent, for with the new communities of miners \u2013 especially in the South Wales valleys, which were densely populated with collieries \u2013 came congregational singing.\n\n\u201cIn unfamiliar new surroundings they found solace and sociability in song, for in a materially poor society the voice was the most democratic of instruments; it cost nothing, for most of us have a voice. Men and women found comfort from the daily industrial grind in their chapels, which were springing up like dragon\u2019s teeth \u2013 by 1900 there were more than 5,000 of them \u2013 dominating both the skyline and the social and cultural life of the people,\u201d Prof Williams said.\n\nIn unfamiliar new surroundings they found solace and sociability in song\n\nWith a society now dominated in numbers by men (around 250,000 miners were employed to extract coal and iron ore from the Welsh landscape at the industry\u2019s height), male singing also grew in popularity, a tradition that continues to this day. I can think of few societies, countries or cultures where male singing is so lauded, commonplace or present.\n\nMike Williams, musical director of C\u00f4r y Boro Welsh Choir (of which I am a member) and Eschoir, a Welsh male voice choir, also in London, explained that, \u201cChoral singing was an opportunity to escape the labour and danger of the mines. When, in 1895, Treorky Male Choir sang for Queen Victoria in St George\u2019s Hall, Windsor, suited and booted, the Queen is said to have remarked \u2018They behaved like gentlemen and sang like angels\u2019. To this day, everyone loves a Welsh choir!\u201d.\n\nPublic singing is not confined to the chapel, either. If travellers somehow finds themselves in the traditionally masculine setting of a Welsh rugby club, they shouldn\u2019t be surprised to witness the patrons spontaneously burst into song. There is no stigma attached to men singing in Wales, or in fact anyone singing in public. Perhaps that is why Welsh singers have been hitting the highs of global popular music for the last 100 years. From Ivor Novello to Sir Tom Jones, Dame Shirley Bassey to Katherine Jenkins, Only Boys Aloud to Stereophonics, we are not afraid to use our voices (even though there are only three million of us).\n\nThe national calendar is filled with festivals, concerts and events encompassing all types of singing \u2013 including the National Eisteddfod, which travels to a different venue each year; the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod (where Pavarotti made his first international appearance); Festival No. 6 at the Italian-inspired Portmeirion village; and one of opera world\u2019s most prestigious events, the BBC Cardiff Singer of the World biennial competition (where Wales\u2019 own Bryn Terfel first found fame).\n\nBut just because singing is a Welsh tradition and we have a healthy stream of Welsh singing talent in the public eye, does that mean everyone can sing? Surely, a whole nation and generations of people can\u2019t naturally have great voices?\n\nAt the recent National Eisteddfod in Cardiff, while the crowd waited for the singing competition results, the entire auditorium of the Wales Millennium Centre spontaneously started singing in beautiful harmony. Any visiting tourists must have thought it strange, but to the Welsh in the hall, it was just natural.\n\n\u201cAnyone can be taught to sing to a basic standard,\u201d Williams said. \u201cBeing able to pitch the correct note can be a challenge for those who have not been brought up singing in schools like most of us are in Wales.\u201d\n\nTo this day, everyone loves a Welsh choir\n\nSo perhaps we don\u2019t all have amazing natural singing voices, but it seems that it doesn\u2019t stop us from trying \u2013 because when I say that singing is in my blood, it is. The tradition of singing has been collectively handed down from generation to generation. Being Welsh and singing seem to go hand in hand, it is just something we all do, even if we don\u2019t quite know why.\n\nAccording to Williams, \u201cHaving a sense of tradition and national pride gives confidence to all aspiring Tom Joneses and Shirley Basseys, as singing is very much a part of our identity. You only need to hear the crowd singing Bread of Heaven at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff to witness this.\u201d\n\nProf Williams perhaps sums it up best with a quote from Milton Shulman\u2019s 1953 review of the film Valley of Song in the Evening Standard: \u201cThere are many things you can say about a Welshman, but never be rude about his larynx.\u201d\n\nSo, maybe I can\u2019t claim that all Welsh people can sing (my great aunt is case in point; sorry Aunty Denise), but what I can say for sure is that all Welsh people are singers.\n\nWhy We Are What We Are is a BBC Travel series examining the characteristics of a country and investigating whether they are true.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

    "text": "Image copyright SUPPLIED Image caption Lynette Dawson, a mother of two, was last seen in 1982\n\nOn paper it was an old story, told many times over the years.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Sydney housewife and mother-of-two Lynette Dawson suddenly disappeared. Over the next 30 years, police searched fruitlessly for her.\n\nBut now, exactly 37 years after her husband Chris Dawson said he last saw her, investigators may finally be closer to finding out the truth.\n\nLast month, police finally made an arrest in the case: Lynette's husband. He has always denied any involvement.\n\nIt is hard to say exactly what prompted this latest development, but more than a few people have pointed towards a podcast released in May 2018.\n\nThe Australian's series The Teacher's Pet - which reinvestigated the case in huge detail and uncovered new witnesses and evidence - caught the attention of millions of people around the globe.\n\nAs yet, it is unclear exactly what role, if any, the podcast played. After all, police had been conducting their own reinvestigation for the past three years.\n\nHowever, many have been left wondering: if not for the work done by journalist Hedley Thomas and his team, would they have jumped into action so quickly?\n\n'We're not law enforcement'\n\nIt is not the first time it's been suggested that a wildly-successful podcast has had an impact on the justice system.\n\nYears before The Teacher's Pet became a must-hear, Serial was essential listening. It focused on the conviction of Adnan Syed, who was jailed for the murder of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee back in 2000, and ended with a retrial being ordered.\n\nIn 2018, it was the turn of another US podcast, In the Dark, to raise questions about a murder conviction. The show's second season told the story of Curtis Flowers, a black Mississippi man tried six times for the same crime by the same white prosecutor.\n\nThat a man could be tried six times for the same crime seems shocking in itself, but more shocking still were the allegations of racial bias, and shifting witness statements - which kept listeners hooked.\n\nImage copyright In The Dark Image caption Curtis Flowers has been in prison since 1997\n\nThe US Supreme Court is now due to hear Flowers' sixth appeal. If that fails, his lawyers will take the case back to the Mississippi Supreme Court - this time aided by the podcast's discoveries.\n\nHowever, In the Dark's Madeleine Baran says she and her team were not - and had never been - \"trying to solve the crime\".\n\n\"We are not law enforcement,\" she stresses.\n\nIt may be for just that reason that podcasts do manage to turn up evidence - or pull apart what were once believed to be cast-iron truths - missed by officials.\n\n\"We have an advantage in that we're not the prosecutor and we are not the defence,\" Baran says. \"That is really important - you need to be calm with factors going either way.\"\n\nYou also, of course, need to tell a good story - good enough to capture the attention of everyone from truck drivers to joggers.\n\nLast hope\n\nThere was no suggestion Police Scotland had done anything wrong in its investigation into the murder of Alistair Wilson, the father-of-two shot dead on his doorstep in the sleepy seaside town of Nairn 13 years ago.\n\nBut the fact it remained unsolved so many years later caught the attention of BBC journalist Fiona Walker, the reporter behind last year's hit podcast The Doorstep Murder.\n\n\"I think everybody wants the crime to be solved, but after 13 years people had lost faith in the official process,\" she explained.\n\n\"They felt our investigations unit was a way of taking another serious look at it.\"\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption The mystery of why Alistair Wilson, pictured with his wife Veronica, was killed remains unsolved\n\nBaran recognises this loss of trust in the authorities: she certainly saw it in Mississippi.\n\n\"The people talking to us had been really treated poorly by the whole process,\" she said. \"They did not want to talk. They were not easy to get to talk.\"\n\nIn fact, Baran and her team would spend a year living in the town, building trust, returning over and over to speak to people, teasing out their recollections.\n\nFor Walker, a tip-off from a source who did not trust the police was the opening she needed to get started on her own investigation.\n\nRead more:\n\n\"The source had this breadth of information and he needed to off-load it,\" she said. \"He had knowledge, a social conscience. But at the same time, he was genuinely scared for his life.\"\n\nThis access to people who might otherwise not speak to officials connected with the case can give these podcasts an edge.\n\n\"People have felt they can come forward to me who are not coming forward to the police,\" Walker acknowledges. \"It is easier to approach me. I've invited them to approach me.\"\n\nBut both journalists point to other factors as well: time, and a determination to leave no stone unturned.\n\nImage copyright Ben Depp for APM Reports Image caption Curtis Flowers' parents Archie and Lola spoke at length to Baran and her team\n\nFor Walker, that meant having patience during \"months and months\" of little to no movement as she waited for people to decide to talk.\n\nFor Baran, it meant re-treading old ground, pushing every contact, and - at one point - digging through piles of prison booking-in cards in an abandoned plastic factory on the off-chance it might contain the one piece of information she was missing.\n\nIt was only later, looking at photos, they discovered they had hit the jackpot.\n\n\"We realised one of these cards was this name that we have been trying to find for a year - among all these mouse droppings.\"\n\nOf course, there are pitfalls too: the potential for a so-called \"trial by media\", as thousands of armchair detectives try to work out exactly whodunit, is not insignificant. Could the information the podcast puts out potentially end up prejudicing or damaging a future trial?\n\nTurning the tide\n\nAnd yet, even the police have cottoned onto the medium as a way solve crimes.\n\nIn California, Newport Police Department's Jennifer Manzella hit on the idea as a way to help them track down Peter Chadwick - a millionaire property developer they allege killed his wife back in 2012. He skipped bail in January 2015.\n\nMr Chadwick presented Newport PD with a relatively unique problem, in that his wealth meant \"he has the resources to be anywhere in the world\", Manzella explained.\n\nImage copyright Newport Police Department Image caption Peter Chadwick (left) allegedly killed his wife Quee Choo in 2014, before fleeing on bail\n\nSo getting the story out far and wide was imperative - and there was only one medium Manzella could think of with the power to do just that: a podcast.\n\nAnd it worked. The afternoon Newport PD unveiled Countdown to Capture, there were \"dozens\" of tips. More followed, and continue to drip in even now, months later.\n\n\"We could never have anticipated the amount of interest. They came forward in their droves,\" Manzella says.\n\n\"We have gone years without getting any tips. We had done national television appeals and got no tips, or maybe one.\"\n\nIt has given everyone hope - not least his wife's family.\n\n\"He is living in somebody's community somewhere,\" Manzella told the BBC. \"We just need people to tell us.\"\n\nHer words are almost echoed by Det Supt Gary Cunningham, the man leading the investigation into Alistair Wilson's death back in Scotland: \"Someone out there knows why Alistair Wilson was killed and who was involved in his murder.\"\n\nNeither Newport PD nor the BBC's podcasts have helped solve the case - yet. There is still the chance they may prove key.\n\n\"The podcast is not fleeting: it is continuing to reach new people and at any point there might be that one person with the information to solve it,\" Walker points out.\n\nBut that also means any further developments will also be scrutinised closely by millions who now feel they have a stake in the story - and there is nothing like the expectation of millions to focus the mind."

    "text": "While we're on the subject, did you know that synthetic clothes are responsible for a third of the plastic in the ocean? For the first eight washes or so, that new fleece or swimming costume sheds tiny bits of plastic which can slip into drains, rivers and ultimately the sea. There they are eaten by fish, and may turn up on your plate. One solution is to wash synthetics in special balls and bags that trap most of the plastic.\n\nBeef is the worst offender, not least because cows have toxic farts... Jo Fidgen\n\n2. Don't eat meat (or hard cheese)\n\nGiving up meat is one of the biggest things you can do to help put a brake on climate change.\n\n40 per cent of all the land in the world is used for farming animals and growing crops to feed them. Animal products are responsible for 15 per cent of our greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nBeef is the worst offender, not least because cows have toxic farts. Instead of converting carbon into carbon dioxide, as we do, they turn it into methane, which is a greenhouse gas about 35 times more potent than CO2.\n\nTo feed a British meat-eater for a year requires a football pitch and a half of land. A vegan would require only a fifth of that \u2013 equivalent to about three penalty boxes. (Thanks to Joseph Poore of the University of Oxford for these statistics.)\n\nIf you are a cheese lover, you can lower your carbon footprint a little by choosing soft cheese over hard cheese, which requires a lot more milk to produce.\n\n3. Don't flush the loo\n\nEach time you flush, you're washing about six litres of drinking water down the drain. We get through an average of 141 litres per person per day in the UK, and the government wants us to get down to 118 litres by 2050. Others say we ought to be using no more than 50.\n\nTreating and distributing water requires energy, so if we turn off the tap we\u2019re reducing emissions as well as conserving supplies.\n\nCape Town was facing the possibility of running out of water last year so residents employed this rule: \u201cIf it's yellow, let it mellow; if it's brown, flush it down\u201d. Some offices had a \u201cflush only every third time\u201d rule.\n\nYou could go further still. A charity in Brazil ran a campaign called \u201cXixi no banho\u201d to persuade people to save water by urinating in the shower. If you don't fancy that, you could collect your shower water in a bucket and use that \u201cgrey\u201d water to flush the loo."

    "text": "Whether it\u2019s English fish and chips or poutine in Qu\u00e9bec, Parisian steak-frites or Belgian frieten with mayonnaise \u2013 or even a \u2018supersized\u2019 fry order in the US \u2013 many places have laid claim to the simple fried potato.\n\nDespite the common name of this dish (and the fact that France has given the world many famous foods, from the baguette to the souffl\u00e9), the French fry is unequivocally Belgian, at least according to Albert Verdeyen, chef and co-author of Carr\u00e9ment Frites, which charts the history of the fry.\n\n\u201cAmericans call it a French fry,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not a French fry, it\u2019s a Francophone fry.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not a French fry, it\u2019s a Francophone fry\n\nCommon lore claims that the original fry was born in Namur in francophone Belgium, where the locals were particularly fond of fried fish. When the River Meuse froze over one cold winter in 1680, people ostensibly fried potatoes instead of the small fish they were accustomed to, and the fry was born.\n\nProponents of this story claim that this Belgian town is not only the source of the French fry, but indeed, of its name: American soldiers, stationed in the francophone region during World War I, allegedly dubbed the potatoes \u2018French fries\u2019, and the common (if slightly imprecise) moniker was born.\n\nAlthough Belgium is currently petitioning Unesco to endorse the fry as an official icon of Belgian cultural heritage, some claim that this legend doesn\u2019t quite hold water.\n\nCulinary historian Pierre Leclercq, professor of the University of Li\u00e8ge, noted in an article on the history of fries that the story is \u201cnot plausible\u201d.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 Why is hummus controversial?\n\n\u2022 The end to a French cheese tradition?\n\n\u2022 A world outraged over crispy chicken\n\nFirst and foremost, Leclercq explained, even if the Namur-based legend is true, it\u2019s far more likely that it took place, not in 1680, but in 1739: after all, he wrote, potatoes were not introduced into the region until 1735. But even once the Namurois had spuds at their disposal, Leclercq said, it\u2019s unlikely that they deep-fried them.\n\n\u201cIn the 18th Century, fat was a luxury for people of limited means,\u201d he explained. \u201cButter was expensive, animal fat was rare, and cheaper vegetable fats were consumed with parsimony. That\u2019s why peasants ate fat straight, without wasting it, on bread or in a soup.\u201d\n\nHe noted that for this reason, the notion that the poor would waste fat by using it for deep-frying seems suspect, challenging the credence of this traditional tale \u2013 regardless of when it ostensibly took place.\n\nLeclercq is not the only one to believe in a different origin story for the French fry. Some people, particularly the French, take the name of the dish a bit more literally. These proponents of a truly \u2018French\u2019 fry claim that the delicacy\u2019s first form was the pomme Pont-Neuf, a deep-fried potato sold by pushcart vendors on Paris\u2019 oldest bridge, the eponymous Pont Neuf, in the late 18th Century.\n\nPotatoes had been deemed suspect by the French ever since their arrival from the New World, despite 18th-Century efforts by agronomist Antoine-Augustin Parmentier to democratise the vegetable after he encountered it as a Prussian prisoner. Parmentier went so far as to hire soldiers to stand guard around his potato patch to increase the allure of the humble spud, even allowing civilians to \u2018steal\u2019 potatoes in the dead of night, thus furthering their reputed desirability. By 1795, the potato had attained popularity across the country, so it\u2019s no stretch of the imagination to consider that the first French fry would be invented and sold in France \u2013 why not by these bridge-bound peddlers in the late 18th or early 19th Century?\n\n\u201cThe inventor of the fried potato will probably always remain anonymous,\u201d said Leclercq in his article. \u201cBut we can guess his job: peddler. We can also guess his origin: Parisian.\u201d\n\nBut despite this vote of confidence for the \u2018French\u2019 fry, we may never truly get to the bottom of who actually invented the food.\n\nFor one, it\u2019s hard to know whether written references to fried potatoes refer to deep-fried lengths of potato, or rather to rounds saut\u00e9ed in a pan with butter. The French fry first appears in writing \u2013 in its current form and with the time-honoured technique of double-frying to achieve the perfect crust and tender interior \u2013 in the early 20th Century in a Belgian guide called the Trait\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9conomie domestique et d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne (Treatise on Domestic Economy and Hygiene). But for Leclercq, even this isn\u2019t enough to categorically prove the fry\u2019s Belgian-ness.\n\nThe inventor of the fried potato will probably always remain anonymous\n\n\u201cPrudence obliges us to not jump to conclusions based on only one text,\u201d he wrote, alluding, too, to a tradition of double-frying in France, as with pommes souffl\u00e9es, a round of potato that naturally puffs up with air when double-fried.\n\n\u201cThe fry is a daughter of street cooking,\u201d culinary historian Madeleine Ferri\u00e8re told Le Monde. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard to establish its birth certificate.\u201d\n\nBut perhaps it\u2019s not its birth certificate that matters when deciding who truly lays claim to the French fry, but rather, who has created the most emblematic version of the dish.\n\nFor some, the French fry, no matter its Francophone origins, has become undeniably American, with the average American consuming about 29 pounds of them a year. The US even went so far as to divide fries from their European origin entirely, with the early 2000s\u2019 shamelessly patriotic \u2018Freedom fries\u2019 in the wake of France\u2019s refusal to support the US\u2019s invasion of Iraq.\n\nThe fry is a daughter of street cooking. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard to establish its birth certificate\n\nCanada, meanwhile, home to McCain Foods, the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of frozen French fries (and other frozen potato specialties), has truly made fries a national dish thanks to poutine. The combination of fries, cheese curds and gravy first appeared in rural Qu\u00e9bec in the 1950s, though its exact birthplace is nearly as much a source of contention as that of the French fry itself, with claims from both the towns of Warwick and Drummondville.\n\n\u201cThere are two or three versions, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever know [which was the original],\u201d said Charles-Alexandre Th\u00e9or\u00eat, author of Maudite Poutine. \u201cAnd maybe it\u2019s better that way.\u201d\n\nToday, the former working-class dish has become a culinary star for all Qu\u00e9beckers, with Montreal\u2019s La Banquise restaurant offering no fewer than 30 combinations of fries, cheese and sauce, and Chef Martin Picard of Au Pied de Cochon even introducing a foie gras poutine to his menu in 2002. This, noted Th\u00e9or\u00eat, launched a \u201cbourgeoisation\u201d of the dish, with versions that occasionally depart quite far from the original, subbing curry sauce for gravy or vegan cheese for cheese curds.\n\nBut while of the three main ingredients, the hardest to replace entirely is the fries, Th\u00e9or\u00eat doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re necessarily more important than either of the other elements.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the base,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re indispensable, but they\u2019re not the most important.\u201d\n\nThe British staple of fish and chips is yet another contender for the most emblematic fried-potato dish. While chips are slightly different from fries, particularly with regards to their shape, the similarities between the two are incontestable.\n\nIn 1928, The New York Times declared fish and chips \u2018England\u2019s hot dog\u2019, and while the chip portion could certainly be seen as more of a side than the main event, it\u2019s perhaps no accident that purveyors of the dish are known as \u2018chippies\u2019 rather than \u2018fishies\u2019.\n\nAs with poutine, modern adaptations of fish and chips at even the most high-end dining establishments have helped the former working-class food to become \u2018classless\u2019, according to the Telegraph, \u201cwhich somewhat increases its credibility as our national dish.\u201d\n\nIn France, the fry\u2019s upward movement happened much earlier, with suggestions for pairing the fried potatoes with grilled meat, \u00e0 la French classic steak-frites, appearing as early as the 18th Century. France also spawned a version that still bears the name of the ostensible original \u2013 the pomme Pont-Neuf. Cut into a perfect rectangle, the pomme Pont-Neuf may boast a more striking aesthetic, but it also creates more waste and is thus more aligned with haute cuisine than with everyday food.\n\nAt Parisian establishment Pont-Neuf \u2013 La Frite Fran\u00e7aise, however, this eponymous cut is not used. Rather, these fries are somewhere between a shoestring and a wider chip and, according to co-founder Jean-Paul Lubot, are truly \u2018French\u2019 fries.\n\nThe Frenchness of these frites comes, first and foremost, from their origins: French ingredients, including local potatoes delivered straight to the restaurant, the variety of which changes according to the season.\n\n\u201cIn Paris, it\u2019s hard to eat good fries,\u201d said Lubot, noting that his vision for Pont-Neuf was not a chip shop, but \u2018a chip boutique\u2019 that would combat the fried-from-frozen fries that too often plague the capital.\n\n\u201cOur approach,\u201d he explained, \u201cis to make a high-end fry.\u201d\n\n\u2018Sides\u2019 here include local Paris ham, shrimp croquettes or meats from Boucherie Metzger, one of Paris\u2019 top butchers. The potatoes, meanwhile, are hand-peeled and cut fresh daily before being double-fried in beef tallow: first in the morning, and then once more, just before serving.\n\n\u201cAs far as we\u2019re concerned, it\u2019s possible to make a French fry as good as the Belgian fry,\u201d Lubot said.\n\nThe Belgian fry, then, remains the reference of quality, the one to beat, even for these very French fry makers. This is, perhaps, no surprise.\n\nAfter all, in a world where fries are often relegated to a mere side dish for burgers, steak or fish, or a base for gravy and cheese, it\u2019s only in Belgium that fries truly are a meal unto themselves: traditionally made from the Dutch Bintje potato, these fries are always double-fried in beef tallow (never oil), piled into a paper cone with a touch of mayonnaise, and purchased from frietkot, or simple mobile fry stalls.\n\nA recent endeavour to revitalise these staples of the Belgian capital spawned a plan to revamp about eight frietkot to the tune of 50,000 euro each. Some found this idea hard to swallow; even Thomas Hick, the architect behind the new frietkots, told The Guardian that the change was \u201ccontentious\u201d.\n\nThe Belgian fry remains the reference of quality, the one to beat\n\n\u201cThe frietkots are old and ramshackle and it\u2019s something we like about Brussels,\u201d he said. \u201cNo fuss. As opposed to the French way \u2013 the Belgians are more raw in the way they eat frites.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that Belgians can, very easily, eat fries on their own,\u201d Verdeyen said.\n\nMaybe this is what makes all the difference.\n\nFood Wars is a series from BBC Travel that invites you to feel the heat when passions flare around beloved dishes that shape a culture\u2019s identity.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

    "text": "You might think being born at sea in winter is something of a disadvantage when you can\u2019t swim, but the sea otter\u2019s mother has that covered \u2013 she keeps her young safe and dry on her belly, then wraps it in kelp when she goes to find food.\n\nWhile many animals give birth to their young in spring, sea otters are often born in the depths of winter.\n\nIf that were not a chilly enough introduction to the world, the single pup is born at sea, where it will remain for most of its life. Remarkably, the pup cannot swim or dive until it is three or four months old, so it will spend its early life balanced on its mother\u2019s chest. When away foraging, the devoted mother will wrap her pup in kelp to keep it from floating away. Sea otters live in offshore forests of this giant kelp, and they eat, sleep and groom on the water\u2019s surface. The adults congregate in single-sex groups called rafts, sometimes linking themselves together.\n\nThey are found in two areas of the world: the Pacific coast of Russia and Alaska, and along the central Californian coast. January and February are the best times to see the new mothers here, lounging on the chilly coastal waters of Monterey Bay. Come springtime, when food is abundant, the young otter will have grown its adult coat \u2013 the densest fur in the animal kingdom with up to a million hairs per square inch \u2013 and be ready to fend for itself. It was for this thick pelt that sea otters were hunted almost to extinction in the early 20th century, and though there are now 3,000 in California alone, and they are legally protected, the species remains endangered.\n\nWith its water-repellant fur, webbed feet and a lung capacity more than twice that of a similar\u2013sized land mammal (it can dive to more than 90m, holding its breath for anything up to five minutes), the sea otter is perfectly adapted to its life on the ocean waves. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws.

But not all social media users were convinced.\n\n\"The Church is not against science and technological progress, but is concerned about the freedom of the individual. Yeah, sure,\" joked one Twitter user.\n\n\"Smile, the Antichrist is about to fly out,\" tweeted another, along with an image of a woman taking a selfie with Patriarch Kirill and other church representatives.\n\nPatriarch Kirill is close to Russian president Vladimir Putin, who participates in big Church celebrations and has gone on pilgrimages to Mount Athos and other famous Orthodox sites. Many Russian Orthodox priests closely identify with President Putin's nationalist agenda.\n\nAt a time when internet freedoms are increasingly restricted in Russia - and authorities are reportedly attempting to create an independent Russian internet - this closeness led some to accuse Patriarch Kirill of lending government policy divine authority.\n\n\"They ban international internet in Russia so that the Antichrist doesn't come out of it,\" one social media user remarked.\n\nOn Saturday, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine split from the Russian Church following centuries of Russian leadership, formalising a decision announced in October.\n\nThe move sparked a furious response in Moscow and deepened a split in the world wide Orthodox Church."

    "text": "This story is featured in BBC Future\u2019s \u201cBest of 2018\u201d collection. Discover more of our picks.\n\n\n\nI can be a reluctant socialiser. I\u2019m sometimes secretly pleased when social plans are called off. I get restless a few hours into a hangout. I even once went on a free 10-day silent meditation retreat \u2013 not for the meditation, but for the silence.\n\nSo I can relate to author Anneli Rufus, who recounted in Party of One: The Loners\u2019 Manifesto:\n\n\u201cWhen parents on TV shows punished their kids by ordering them to go to their rooms, I was confused. I loved my room. Being there behind a locked door was a treat. To me a punishment was being ordered to play Yahtzee with my cousin Louis.\u201d\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 The everyday habits that reveal our personalities\n\n\u2022 Five myths about loneliness\n\n\u2022 The dangerous downsides of perfectionism\n\nAsocial tendencies like these are often far from ideal. Abundant research shows the harms of social isolation, considered a serious public health problem in countries that have rapidly ageing populations (though talk of a \u2018loneliness epidemic\u2019 may be overblown). In the UK, the Royal College of General Practitioners says that loneliness has the same risk level for premature death as diabetes. Strong social connections are important for cognitive functioning, motor function and a smoothly running immune system.\n\nThis is especially clear from cases of extreme social isolation. Examples of people kept in captivity, children kept isolated in abusive orphanages, and prisoners kept in solitary confinement all show how prolonged solitude can lead to hallucinations and other forms of mental instability.\n\nBut these are severe and involuntary cases of aloneness. For those of us who just prefer plenty of alone time, emerging research suggests some good news: there are upsides to being reclusive \u2013 for both our work lives and our emotional well-being.\n\nCreative space\n\nOne key benefit is improved creativity. Gregory Feist, who focuses on the psychology of creativity at California\u2019s San Jose State University, has defined creativity as thinking or activity with two key elements: originality and usefulness. He has found that personality traits commonly associated with creativity are openness (receptiveness to new thoughts and experiences), self-efficacy (confidence), and autonomy (independence) \u2013 which may include \u201ca lack of concern for social norms\u201d and \u201ca preference for being alone\u201d. In fact, Feist\u2019s research on both artists and scientists shows that one of the most prominent features of creative folks is their lesser interest in socialising.\n\nOne reason for this is that such people are likely to spend sustained time alone working on their craft. Plus, Feist says, many artists \u201care trying to make sense of their internal world and a lot of internal personal experiences that they\u2019re trying to give expression to and meaning to through their art.\u201d Solitude allows for the reflection and observation necessary for that creative process.\n\nA recent vindication of these ideas came from University at Buffalo psychologist Julie Bowker, who researches social withdrawal. Social withdrawal usually is categorised into three types: shyness caused by fear or anxiety; avoidance, from a dislike of socialising; and unsociability, from a preference for solitude.\n\nA paper by Bowker and her colleagues was the first to show that a type of social withdrawal could have a positive effect \u2013 they found that creativity was linked specifically to unsociability. They also found that unsociability had no correlation with aggression (shyness and avoidance did).\n\nThis was significant because while previous research had suggested that unsociability might be harmless, Bowker and colleagues\u2019 paper showed that it could actually be beneficial. Unsociable people are likely to be \u201chaving just enough interaction,\u201d Bowker says. \u201cThey have a preference for being alone, but they also don\u2019t mind being with others.\u201d\n\nThere is gender and cultural variation, of course. For instance, some research suggests that unsociable children in China have more interpersonal and academic problems than unsociable kids in the West. Bowker says that these differences are narrowing as the world becomes more globalised.\n\nStill, it turns out that solitude is important for more than creativity.\n\nInward focus\n\nIt\u2019s commonly believed that leaders need to be gregarious. But this depends \u2013 among other things, on the personalities of their employees. One 2011 study showed that in branches of a pizza chain where employees were more passive, extroverted bosses were associated with higher profits. But in branches where employees were more proactive, introverted leaders were more effective. One reason for this is that introverted people are less likely to feel threatened by strong personalities and suggestions. They\u2019re also more likely to listen.\n\nSince ancient times, meanwhile, people have been aware of a link between isolation and mental focus. After all, cultures with traditions of religious hermits believe that solitude is important for enlightenment.\n\nRecent research has given us a better understanding of why. One benefit of unsociability is the brain\u2019s state of active mental rest, which goes hand-in-hand with the stillness of being alone. When another person is present, your brain can\u2019t help but pay some attention. This can be a positive distraction. But it\u2019s still a distraction.\n\nDaydreaming in the absence of such distractions activates the brain\u2019s default-mode network. Among other functions, this network helps to consolidate memory and understand others\u2019 emotions. Giving free rein to a wandering mind not only helps with focus in the long term but strengthens your sense of both yourself and others. Paradoxically, therefore, periods of solitude actually help when it comes time to socialise once more. And the occasional absence of focus ultimately helps concentration in the long run.\n\nA more recent proponent of thoughtful and productive solitude is Susan Cain, author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can\u2019t Stop Talking and founder of Quiet Revolution, a company that promotes quiet and introvert-friendly workplaces. \u201cThese days, we tend to believe that creativity emerges from a decidedly gregarious process, but in fact it requires sustained attention and deep focus,\u201d she says. \u201cAlso, humans are such porous, social beings that when we surround ourselves with others, we automatically take in their opinions and aesthetics. To truly chart our own path or vision, we have to be willing to sequester ourselves, at least for some period of time.\u201d\n\nHermit health\n\nStill, the line between useful solitude and dangerous isolation can be blurry. \u201cAlmost anything can be adaptive and maladaptive, depending on how extreme they get,\u201d Feist says. A disorder has to do with dysfunction. If someone stops caring about people and cuts off all contact, this could point to a pathological neglect of social relations. But creative unsociability is a far cry from this.\n\nIn fact, Feist says, \u201cthere\u2019s a real danger with people who are never alone.\u201d It\u2019s hard to be introspective, self-aware, and fully relaxed unless you have occasional solitude. In addition, introverts tend to have fewer but stronger friendships \u2013 which has been linked to greater happiness.\n\nAs with many things, quality reigns over quantity. Nurturing a few solid relationships without feeling the need to constantly populate your life with chattering voices ultimately may be better for you.\n\nThus, if your personality tends toward unsociability, you shouldn\u2019t feel the need to change. Of course, that comes with caveats. But as long as you have regular social contact, you are choosing solitude rather than being forced into it, you have at least a few good friends and your solitude is good for your well-being or productivity, there\u2019s no point agonising over how to fit a square personality into a round hole.\n\nSo feel free to de-clutter your social calendar. It\u2019s psychologist-approved.\n\nJoin 800,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    ],
    "text": "It has been 60 years since Enigma codebreaker Alan Turing came up with a theory for why the leopard has its spots. As stem cell research proves him right, we look at how patterns in nature can be explained by mathematics.\n\nIt\u2019s a rare sort of mind that looks at the visual hotchpotch of a spotted, speckled and striped leopard\u2019s pelt and finds a means of applying order to the shapes through mathematics.\n\nThe apparent randomness of the patterns that appear in nature \u2013 a zebra\u2019s zigzagging stripe or the labyrinthine mosaic of a giraffe\u2019s skin \u2013 are accepted without question by most of us. Alan Turing, the prolific mathematician best known for helping to break the Enigma code at Bletchley Park during the Second World War, and for writing a scientific paper that would form the basis for modern computing \u2013 was not content with simply marvelling at the miracle of nature.\n\nIn 1952, Turing published a ground-breaking paper called \u2018The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis\u2019 \u2013 his last work before his apparent suicide just before his 42nd birthday \u2013 containing an elegant mathematical schema for the formation of the patterns found in animals and plants. The patterns were far from random, he argued, and were the result of interacting chemicals that spread among groups of otherwise identical cells. He coined the term morphogen (morpho, from the Greek for \u2018form\u2019, and gen, from the Greek for \u2018to beget\u2019), meaning shape-formers. Turing was deliberately vague about what these morphogens were. They could be hormones, perhaps, or genes, the chemical nature of which, in the 1950s, was still to be unravelled. The main idea was that they diffuse and react with each other: this is now called the reaction-diffusion process. His theory \u2013 laid out in beguiling mathematics \u2013 had it that within tissue or cells there are two morphogens that act on one another: one creates the other, and makes more and more of itself, and the other, second chemical limits the creation of the first. Both diffuse, or in other words, spread out, at different rates. It has been compared to a predator-prey situation; the idea that, repeatedly in the development of a biological entity, two chemicals can work in tandem both independently and in competition. It\u2019s as if one is chasing the other away.\n\nAt the most basic level, patterns emerge from randomness as varying concentrations of colour-activating and colour-inhibiting chemicals interact. Dark spots form and, in turn, the spots merge into stripes as the colour-activating tissues become more concentrated. Seen on creatures ranging from zebras to seashells to giraffes, they have come to be known as Turing patterns. In recent years, scientists have found Turing patterns in wind-blown sand, attributing the ripples to the same reaction-diffusion process, and even human communities, suggesting that phenomena such as crime hotspots can arise from social feedbacks on behaviour and movement that are similar to the push-me-pull-you process Turing identified.\n\nProving the theory\n\nFor three decades, Turing\u2019s theory on morphogenesis was largely ignored by biologists. But the combined arrival of powerful computers and the dawn of modern molecular cell biology, as well as the work of two generations of scientists who took Turing\u2019s theory seriously from the 80s onwards, have contributed to proving it.\n\nJeremy Green, professor of developmental biology at King\u2019s College London, and his team provided one of the first non-theoretical proofs of Turing\u2019s ideas in 2014, when they discovered that the ridges on the roof of a mouse\u2019s mouth acted like stripes or spots in morphogenesis. They identified the two chemicals needed to produce this \u2013 and proved in mice that it works.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been possible, but only in very recent times, to really test Turing\u2019s theory,\u2019 Professor Green says. \u2018There are a relatively limited number of examples where people have done that in a rigorous way \u2013 skin being one, my research into the palate being another, and left-right asymmetry in fish being the third. Turing was right and we\u2019ve now got the names [for the shape-formers].\u2019 Broadly speaking, the morphogens in this case turned out to be protein growth factors, of which there are six main ones. \u2018Each one of those six can come in a bunch of different flavours,\u2019 says Green \u2013 so determining what the job of each morphogen is will be critical, as scientists come to programme stem cells to do certain things in the body.\n\nIt might be counterintuitive to many of us, but it makes sense that a mathematician would look at patterns in biology and try to formulate an equation for their existence. It\u2019s only now that scientists are realising quite how far ahead Turing\u2019s thinking was.\n\nPhotograph \u00a9 Nick Johns\n\nSign-up for the BBC Earth newsletter\n\nExplore more of BBC Earth\n\nBy Matilda Battersby\n\n"

    "title": "Vegans: The most googled questions about veganism answered",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nPeople are searching for veganism on Google more than they have at any point over the last year - no doubt thanks in part to Greggs's hugely popular new vegan sausage roll.\n\nPlant-based diets are very much on the menu every January - as people try their hand at Veganuary - so it makes sense there are more questions being asked.\n\nSo we've answered some of most googled vegan-related queries to help you out:\n\nHow do vegans get calcium and protein?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIt's been drilled into us all from a young age that calcium \"makes your bones grow stronger\" - as a well-known advert goes.\n\nTraditionally that's been associated with animal products like milk and yoghurt.\n\nIf you're considering a plant-based diet you'll want to stock up on alternatives like lettuce, rocket salad, parsley and kale - as well as stuff you might not normally buy like edamame beans, pak choi and dried figs.\n\nProtein can be another big worry for people trying a vegan diet.\n\nBut there's a fair amount of choice, including cheap and cheerful snacks like nuts and seeds - and the huge amount of protein bars sold these days that contain them.\n\nWhole grains are something else to consider - you can dream up a tasty protein-packed menu by combining grains like brown rice with legumes such as chickpeas and lentils.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nAnd you can even get pasta made of lentils these days if Indian isn't your flavour.\n\nIf you love nothing more than a can of baked beans, you're in luck - beans of all kinds can also be a good source of protein, as well as soy products like tofu and tempeh.\n\nThere are tons of options.\n\nBut vegans risk missing out on essential nutrients the body needs - like the vitamin B12 which is only found naturally in foods from animal sources - so meal planning is important.\n\nHow do vegans make cake?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nEggs, milk, flour, sugar, butter, chocolate.\n\nAll these common cake ingredients are vegan to begin with or readily available in a vegan form - except the eggs.\n\nMany vegans like to use egg replacers, which are easy to make at home.\n\nTypical substitutes can include things like banana, flaxseed, applesauce and chia seeds.\n\nVegan Amy Kennedy, 21, from Essex, tells Radio 1 Newsbeat: \"Vegan cakes are becoming more and more accessible, and a lot of the big supermarkets are releasing vegan cupcakes.\n\n\"A lot of biscuits are accidentally vegan too.\"\n\nAre vegans against pets?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThere isn't a straight yes or no answer to this one.\n\nAmy says: \"I think pets is a very blurred area for veganism, the reason being how they're acquired.\n\n\"I'm personally against pets that are acquired through pet shops due to the practices that bring the animals into existence.\n\n\"If you rescue an animal and have all the correct facilities and abilities to keep them happy and healthy I see no issue.\"\n\nRaoul, from The Vegan Corner, YouTube's first professional cookery channel dedicated entirely to plant-based cuisine, says he doesn't believe vegans are against pets but it depends on how they are treated.\n\n\"For example, keeping a bird or a hamster in a small cage 24 hours a day for your own amusement isn't something I would personally consider a nice thing.\n\n\"I do not have pets, but I've had dogs in the past and my goal has always been to live a great life together, and in this I can't see any non-vegan behaviour.\"\n\nAre vegans against wool?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nMost vegans are against wool, according to Raoul.\n\nThis is because wool is obtained by raising sheep with the sole purpose of shearing their woollen fleece.\n\nAmy says she's also against wearing wool as \"it feels wrong to me to wear an animal's coat\".\n\n\"If people own items that contain animal products before going vegan they should definitely re-gift them as to avoid waste.\"\n\nAre vegans healthier?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nRecent analysis, which compared the health of vegetarian and vegans against that of meat eaters, suggests they are.\n\nResearchers found being a vegetarian or vegan was associated with a significantly lower risk of heart disease and cancer.\n\nBut the analysis found that being vegetarian or vegan doesn't necessarily mean you'll live longer.\n\nSophie Blakeley, 24, from Salford, told Newsbeat: \"I'm doing Veganuary so I am more conscious of what I'm eating as well as a meat-free and animal product-free lifestyle is more ethical.\n\n\"I think some vegan diets are healthier such as the raw vegan diet and the clean eating vegan diets but there is still a lot of junk food products that are suitable for vegans so that really depends on the person's diet preference.\"\n\nWhy are vegans called vegans?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Reporter Nesta McGregor tried Veganuary in 2018 for a Newsbeat documentary\n\nThe definition of vegan is \"a person who refrains from using any animal product whatever for food, clothing or any other purpose\", according to the Collins English Dictionary.\n\nThe term is said to have been coined in the 1940s by Donald Watson, the founder of The Vegan Society, as a way of describing non-dairy vegetarians.\n\n\"Most of the labels like pescatarian, freegan, and lacto-ovo vegetarian, are created to identify one's way of eating, while being vegan is not something related to food only, but a way of living aimed at reducing any sort of animal exploitation,\" says Raoul.\n\n\"It is a common mistake to think that a vegan is simply someone who doesn't consume animal products, as the reality is much deeper than that.\"\n\nThe top vegan-related searches were provided by Google trends.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra -

    "title": "Eight odd details hidden in masterpieces",
    "authors": [
      "Kelly Grovier"
    ],
    "text": "What do the greatest paintings and sculptures in cultural history \u2013 from Girl with a Pearl Earring to Picasso\u2019s Guernica, from the Terracotta Army to Edvard Munch\u2019s The Scream \u2013 have in common? Each is hardwired with an underappreciated, indeed often overlooked, detail that ignites its meaning from deep inside. That, at least, is the premise of my new book, A New Way of Seeing: The History of Art in 57 Works, a study that invites readers to reconnect with works that are so familiar we no longer really see them.\n\nTaking as my starting point the most revered images in all of human history (from Trajan\u2019s Column to American Gothic, the Elgin Marbles to Matisse\u2019s The Dance), I went looking for what makes great art great \u2013 why some works continue to vibrate in popular imagination century after century, while the vast majority of artistic creations slip our consciousness almost as quickly as we encounter them. Combing the surface of these works, I was surprised to discover that each contains a flourish of strangeness which, once spotted, unlocks exciting new readings and changes forever the way we engage with these masterpieces.\n\nAs these remarkable details began to reveal themselves, from a ghostly finger fidgeting on Mona Lisa\u2019s right hand to a tarot symbol for fortitude hiding in plain sight in one of Frida Kahlo\u2019s most mysterious self-portraits, I was reminded of a remark by Charles Baudelaire. \u201cBeauty,\u201d the French poet and critic wrote in 1859, \u201calways contains a touch of strangeness, of simple, unpremeditated and unconscious strangeness.\u201d\n\nWhat follows is a brief digest of some of the more extraordinary details \u2013 touches of strangeness that invigorate, often subliminally, many of the most recognisable images in art history.\n\nThe Bayeux Tapestry (c. 1077 or after)\n\nThe forgotten women who, a millennium ago, embroidered the 70m of cloth on which the Bayeux Tapestry chronicles the events that led to the Norman Conquest, were not just exquisite seamstresses, they were exceptional storytellers. The arrow that pierces the eye of King Harold in a climactic scene near the end of the visual epic is a meta-narrative device that doubles as the very needle with which the history has been intricately woven. By grabbing the arrow, the wounded Harold blurs his own identity into those of both the artist and the observer, whose own eye has been pulled forward, scene by scene. With a single stitch, our eye, Harold\u2019s, and that of the seamstress\u2019s needle collapse into one.\n\nSandro Botticelli, The Birth of Venus (1482-5)\n\nA wind-spun spiral of golden hair suspended on the goddess\u2019s right shoulder in Sandro Botticelli\u2019s Renaissance masterpiece The Birth of Venus whirs like a miniature motor on the vertical axis of the painting, propelling it forward into our imagination. A perfect logarithmic curl, this is no incidental ornament or accident of brushwork. The same spinning vector, observable in the plunge of raptor birds and the twist of nautilus shells, has hypnotised thinkers since antiquity. In the 17th Century, a Swiss mathematician, Jacob Bernoulli, would eventually christen the curl spira mirabilis, or \u201cmarvellous spiral\u201d. In Botticelli\u2019s painting \u2013 a work that celebrates timeless elegance \u2013 the inscrutable spiral whispers into Venus\u2019s right ear, divulging to her the very secrets of truth and beauty.\n\nHieronymus Bosch, The Garden of Earthly Delights (1505-10)\n\nThat an egg lies hidden in plain sight at the dead centre of Hieronymus Bosch\u2019s carnival of fleshly shenanigans (balanced atop a horseman\u2019s head) is well enough known by critics and casual admirers of the painting alike. But how does that delicate detail unlock the work\u2019s truest meaning? If we swing shut the triptych\u2019s side panels to reveal the work\u2019s outer shell and the ghostly ovoid of a fragile world that Bosch has depicted on the work\u2019s exterior \u2013 a translucent orb floating in the ether \u2013 we discover that he conceived his painting as a kind of egg endlessly to be cracked and uncracked every time we engage with the complex work. By opening and closing Bosch\u2019s painting, we alternately set a fledgling world in motion or turn the hand of time back to before the beginning, before our innocence was lost.\n\nJohannes Vermeer, Girl with a Pearl Earring (c. 1665)\n\nThink you see a pearl dangling lustrously in Vermeer\u2019s famous portrait of a girl endlessly turning towards or away from us? Think again. The swollen bauble around which the painting\u2019s mystery spins is just a pigment of your imagination. With a flick of the wrist and two deft dabs of white paint, the artist has tricked the primary visual cortices of our brains\u2019 occipital lobes into magicking a pearl from the thinnest of air. Squint as tight as you wish and there is no loop that links the ornament to her ear. Its very sphericity is a hoax. We\u2019ve willed the earring into weightless suspension from the puniest of white apostrophes. Vermeer\u2019s precious gem is an opulent optical illusion, one that reflects back on our own illusory presence in the world.\n\nJMW Turner, Rain, Steam, and Speed \u2013 The Great Western Railway (1844)\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Turner secreted a sprinting hare in the murky path of the approaching locomotive. The artist himself pointed it out to a little boy who visited the Royal Academy on varnishing day just as the work was about to go on show. But how does this tiny detail ignite the meaning of Turner\u2019s huge meditation on encroaching technology? Why did he feel compelled to point it out? Since antiquity the hare has symbolised rebirth and hope. The emotions of visitors who saw the painting when it was first exhibited in 1844 were still raw with the horror of a tragedy that had occurred on Christmas Eve two and a half years earlier, when a train derailed 10 miles from the bridge depicted in the painting \u2013 an accident that killed nine third-class commuters and maimed another 16. By going small in the emblem of the hare, an artist famous for going big transforms his painting into a poignant tribute and meditation on the fragility of life.\n\nGeorges Seurat, Bathers at Asni\u00e8res (1884)\n\nThe large painting of Parisians whiling away a lazy lunch hour on the banks of the river Seine, the first work ever exhibited by Seurat, was initially finished in 1884. It was then touched up by the artist years later, after he had begun to perfect his signature technique of applying small distinct dots that cohere in the eye of the observer when seen at a distance. The colour theory that underpins Seurat\u2019s more mature pointillist style owes its origin in part to the ideas of a French chemist, Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul, who explained how the juxtaposition of hues can generate a persistence of tone in our imagination. In the hazy distance of Seurat\u2019s painting, a row of smokestacks rise from a factory that produced candles according to an industrial innovation for which Chevreul was also responsible. These chimneys, which seem more like paintbrushes daubing the work into existence, are a tribute to the thinker without whom Seurat\u2019s resplendent vision would not have been possible.\n\nEdvard Munch, The Scream (1893)\n\nIt has long been assumed that the howling figure in Edvard Munch\u2019s The Scream \u2013 an archetype of angst that still flickers above the popular imagination more than a century after it was created \u2013 was indebted chiefly to the aghast expression frozen on the face of a Peruvian mummy that the artist encountered at the 1889 Universal Exposition in Paris. But Munch was an artist concerned more about the future than the past, and especially anxious about the pace of technology. Surely he would have been even more deeply impressed by the breath-taking spectacle of an enormous lightbulb filled with 20,000 smaller bulbs that stood on a pedestal and towered over the pavilion in the same Exposition? A tribute to the ideas of Thomas Edison, the sculpture rose like a crystalline god heralding a new idolatry, flipping a switch in Munch\u2019s mind. The contours of The Scream\u2019s yowling face reflect with extraordinary precision the drooping jaw and bulbous cranium of Edison\u2019s terrifying electric totem.\n\nGustav Klimt, The Kiss (1907)\n\nSurely love and passion stand at the furthest extreme from the long white lab coats and microscopic slides of scientific testing. Not according to Gustav Klimt\u2019s painting The Kiss. The year he painted his work, Vienna was alive with the language of platelets and blood cells, especially around the University of Vienna where Klimt himself had, years earlier, been invited to create paintings based on medical themes. Karl Landsteiner, a pioneering immunologist at the University (the scientist who first distinguished blood groups) was hard at work attempting to make blood transfusions succeed. Look closer at the curious patterns that throb on the woman\u2019s frock in Klimt\u2019s painting and one suddenly sees them for what they are: Petri dishes pulsing with cells as if the artist has offered us a scan of her soul. The Kiss is Klimt\u2019s luminous biopsy of eternal love.\n\nA New Way of Seeing: The History of Art in 57 Works is out now, published by Thames & Hudson.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "text": "The art of lying down\n\nA photograph captured in January on the streets of the Honduran city of Tegucigalpa, showing a young woman protesting against the re-election of President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, captured the world\u2019s attention. Lolling on the pavement before a line of police officers, her head on her hands in nonplussed defiance, she struck a pose that located herself in a long line of iconic loungers in the history of image making \u2013 from a 2nd-Century sculpture of Sleeping Hermaphroditus to the recumbent field hands in Vincent van Gogh\u2019s 1890 painting, Rest from Work.\n\nX-ray style\n\nAfter a Chinese woman hopped onto a conveyor belt to join her handbag as it slipped through a security scanner at a crowded checkpoint in Dongguan Railway Station in southern China, the eerie X-rays captured by the machine went viral in February. Transforming the anxious commuter from flesh into a dark ghostly shudder, the images seemed at once futuristic and primitive, recalling what archaeologists have termed the \u2018X-ray style\u2019 of Aboriginal art dating back thousands of years, discovered in Ubirr (in the East Alligator Region of Kakadu National Park, Australia).\n\nSpace odyssey\n\n\n\nIn February, South African-born entrepreneur Elon Musk launched into the sun\u2019s orbit his old commuter car, a 2008 Tesla Roadster. Photos that went viral \u2013 of a mannequin dressed as an astronaut appearing to steer the car through space \u2013 offered a dislocating perspective of Earth, which the car seems surreally to be speeding away from. Not since Bosch depicted on the closed doors of his famous triptych, The Garden of Earthly Delights, a ghostly globe adrift in the heavens, has our planet seemed so strangely out of reach.\n\nNBA Old Master\n\nIn April, a startling photo showed James Harden, a guard for the Houston Rockets, losing his balance and stumbling into the front row of fans gathered in the Target Center arena in Minnesota. The image reminded many on social media of dramas depicted in Renaissance masterpieces; I saw echoes of Raphael\u2019s The Transfiguration \u2013 the famous final painting by the High Renaissance master \u2013 especially in the aggressive pointing by bystanders in both images.\n\nLava river in a quiet neighbourhood\n\nOn 5 May, the largest earthquake to hit Hawaii in 40 years upset a shelf of magma inside the volcano K\u012blauea. Photos of fiery lava oozing its way through the streets of the islands\u2019 District of Puna stopped the world in its tracks. A similar sulphuric phenomenon captured the imagination of 18th-Century Europe, when ominous rumblings from Italy\u2019s serially eruptive Mount Vesuvius inspired the English painter Joseph Wright of Derby to depict the cataclysm in a series of works.\n\nStork trapped in plastic\n\nA chilling photo that captures the plight of a stork ensnared by a clear plastic bag was widely shared when it featured in a National Geographic campaign launched in May. Though the photographer who captured the image in Spain freed the encumbered creature, the image haunts. The predicament of a bird trapped in a lethal bubble recalls the drama of British artist Joseph Wright of Derby\u2019s Experiment on a Bird in an Air Pump.\n\nG7 summit\n\nA photo taken at the G7 summit in June, in which German Chancellor Angela Merkel, flanked by world leaders, leans over a table to address the sitting US President, seemed to many to capture the tense relationship between Donald Trump and his Nato allies. The arrangement of figures uncannily recalls the composition of the Early Netherlandish painter Hieronymus Bosch\u2019s cryptic painting The Conjurer (1502), in which a group of respectable townspeople are slowly lured into the orbit of a savvy huckster.\n\nUniversal religion\n\nIn order to stop an aerial strike by Belgium\u2019s Vincent Kompany during this year\u2019s World Cup in Russia, Japan\u2019s goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima found himself undertaking some extraordinary vertical acrobatics. Kawashima\u2019s soaring physique, as captured in a thrilling photo by Petr David Josek, mirrors a relatively rare portrayal of a winged Christ hovering hummingbird-like above St Francis as he receives the same wounds Christ suffered during crucifixion.\n\nHalf-mast flag\n\nFollowing the death of US Senator John McCain in August, the White House conveyed mixed signals about how much respect the former prisoner of war and Republican nominee for president deserved. The Trump administration first lowered, then raised, then lowered again the Stars and Stripes. In light of the controversy, we explored how artworks from Emanuel Leutze's famous Washington Crossing the Delaware (1851) to contemporary artist Sean Scully\u2019s Ghost Gun (2017) have tapped into the talismanic mystique of the American flag.\n\nPalestinian protester\n\nAgainst a sky scarfed by smoke and tear gas, a protester thrusts forward with his right hand a tattered Palestinian flag, striking a pose that many on social media controversially likened to Delacroix\u2019s Liberty Leading the People. But it\u2019s the sling he whirls above his head with his left hand that fixes him forever in an ancient posture of stone hurlers that dates back at least to the 7th-Century BC and a gypsum relief of striding Assyrian slingers suspended in mid swing.\n\nRobot tweaking\n\nThe photo of a prosthetic expert tinkering with the cranial circuitry of a robot created by the company Engineered Arts is as captivating as it is disquieting. Engineered Art\u2019s commitment to making from inanimate matter \u201cfaithful recreations of real-world people with accuracy possible to the last pore or finest of hairs\u201d, recalls the devotion of the mythic Cypriot sculptor Pygmalion, whose passion for a beauty he had chiselled from stone precipitates the magical melting of her marble body into living flesh.\n\nBanksy shred\n\nThe crack of the hammer was still ringing in the air of the auction house when the work that had just been sold for 1.2m Euros, British street artist Banksy\u2019s Girl with a Balloon, suddenly began to slip in slivers from the bottom of its frame to a chorus of gasps. In time, the art world would learn that Banksy had engineered the prank by fitting the frame with a hidden shredder to create a new work in its own right: \u2018Love is in the bin\u2019. The unravelling of the romantic image into flimsy ribbons recalls MC Escher\u2019s famous fraying of faces, Bond of Union (1956).\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

One of the criteria that we set ourselves when we talk about coming back is that there is no point in doing another series unless we can make it the biggest, scariest, most exciting and most thrilling series that we\u2019ve done. If we\u2019ve done our job correctly, then that\u2019s what the viewers can expect. What was new in Series 5? First of all, this series does find Luther at the beginning in a happier and more settled place, which in itself is new because we are not used to seeing a happy and settled Luther. That was fun to do because we see a new aspect of the character that we haven\u2019t seen before, and even more so because we blow it up and take it away very quickly. We also for the first time, instead of doing two two-parters, for our main villain story we have one story stretched over the four episodes. This has allowed us to tell a more complex, darker and scarier crime story than what we\u2019ve been able to do before.\n\nTell us a bit about the decision to focus Series 5 on a single case? Idris and I are always wary about resting on our laurels and just doing what we have done before. We are always trying to finding new ways to tell stories about John Luther. No matter what else happens in the series it\u2019s all about John Luther and the effect of these crimes on him. We have told many and various crime stories in the past, what we haven\u2019t had the chance to do is immerse him in something that he can\u2019t solve very quickly. Luther has always got too much to do. There\u2019s always a story in his personal life and always a crime that he has to solve. It was really good fun, exciting and new to see him even less in control of things than he ordinarily is. To see this crime, spiral out of control and run out of control and have circumstances such that he wasn\u2019t always able to run to the scene and solve it and catch the bad guy. Tell us about the Crime in Series 5? We want to make the show as exciting and scary as possible. One of the reasons that people respond so positively to Luther is because they are terrified by the crimes in Luther. They are not designed by us as an exploitation. Every scary event that I write is not what I would like to do to other people it\u2019s more what I am scared that other people would do to me. Although it\u2019s big and exaggerated it\u2019s all rooted in some kind of truth, some kind of real fear.\n\nYou must enable javascript to play content The terrifying bus killer scene - *SPOILER if you haven't yet watched Series 5*\n\nHow do you come up with the storylines in Luther? Usually the idea of a crime or criminal in Luther will come to me in one of two ways: One of which is when I\u2019m sitting with my wife watching TV and I\u2019ll suddenly burst out laughing, then she\u2019ll know that I have just had a really scary idea. The other way springs from events in my own life and the fact that I\u2019m a very anxious and scared person. The experience of existing in London, although nothing has ever happened to me here, gives rise to these genuine moments of terror, which are exaggerated by my nervous and anxious demeanour. Every time I ride on a night bus, every time I hear a tap-tap-tapping at the window, every time I\u2019m walking down a long empty street and the trees are blowing in the darkness, I mentally step into Luther land. All of my fears of the worst thing that could possibly happen to me or to my loved ones, that\u2019s the origin point of where the Luther killers lurk.\n\nAlice Morgan (RUTH WILSON) in Luther (Image Credit: BBC / Des Willie)"

China plans to follow this up with further missions to return Moon rock to laboratories on Earth.\n\nBut it's not just scientists who are fascinated with the Moon's hidden face.\n\nMusicians, film-makers and, of course, conspiracy theorists have all been inspired by that secret, barren landscape.\n\n'There is no dark side of the Moon, really. As a matter of fact it's all dark.'\n\nFor music fans, the phrase Dark Side of the Moon will forever conjure up Pink Floyd's 1973 concept album.\n\nIn reality, the far side of the Moon is not dark - we never see it because the Moon orbits the Earth at around the same rate it spins. All parts of the Moon receive sunlight.\n\nIt's likely that the members of Pink Floyd weren't referring to this phenomenon of Tidal Locking with their album title, though.\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon, here, is a metaphor for mental illness.\n\nImage copyright NSSDC Image caption One of the first pictures of the far side of the moon.\n\nThe Moon has been thought to have an effect on events - and moods - here on Earth for thousands of years.\n\nAncient Babylonians recorded the phases of the Moon on clay tablets.\n\nBut it wasn't until Isaac Newton identified gravity in the 18th Century that we began to understand its effect on tides.\n\nIn 1959 a Russian probe took the first photographs of the Moon's hidden face, and it was first seen by the naked eye almost ten years later when American astronauts flew past.\n\nThe 'Castle' on the Moon\n\nThere seems to be something tantalising about the hidden side of the Moon, though. The thought that it's always there, circling the Earth, yet just out of reach.\n\nAnd that's sparked several conspiracy theories over the years.\n\nThere have been claims that astronauts saw a secret lunar base there - even some kind of castle. And some have even gone so far as to suggest aliens were encountered on the lunar surface.\n\nNasa, unsurprisingly, says there's no truth to any of these theories.\n\nIt does seem possible, though, that at the height of the Cold War between the USA and Russia, both sides considered using the far side of the Moon for a show of force.\n\nReports claim there were plans to detonate a nuclear bomb there as a show of strength. Thankfully even if that's true, the idea never got anywhere close to lift-off.\n\nImage copyright Twitter/CGTNOfficial Image caption No castles, no secret bases... this picture was sent back by the Chinese probe\n\nSoul-eating aliens?\n\nWriters and film-makers have been inspired by the far side of the Moon, too, though none seem to have produced anything with the longevity of Pink Floyd's masterpiece.\n\nA 1990 horror film entitled The Dark Side of the Moon tells the story of a group of astronauts who discover an abandoned shuttle there. They later discover it went missing in the Bermuda Triangle and is home to an alien which feeds on human souls.\n\nWe haven't had the chance to watch, but its average score of 2.6 on Rotten Tomatoes seems about right.\n\nIn literature, the website Goodreads returns more than 200 results for books entitled Dark Side of the Moon, including a 1976 tale from children's author William Corlett about the journey of a lonely, troubled astronaut.\n\nSo whatever the Chang'e-4 probe tells us about rock formations and craters, it seems certain that the hidden face of the Moon will continue to exert a gravitational pull on imaginations here on planet Earth.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here."

    "text": "\u2018Their limbs wracked and, tormented so ... their arms, necks, and backs turned this way and that way, and returned back again. Their mouths stopped, their throats choked. They had several sore fits.\u2019 \u2013 A contemporary description of cousins Betty Parris and Abigail Williams, the first of the afflicted at Salem.\n\nTheir speech was garbled and their limbs contorted, they wailed and howled and convulsed. It was 1692. Betty was nine and Abigail was 11.\n\nReverend Samuel Parris was advised by a doctor that the girls, his daughter and niece, respectively, were bewitched. Soon, at least five other girls in Salem Village developed similar symptoms and began to accuse locals of witchcraft including Tituba, a slave, and Sarah Good, a homeless beggar. A flurry of accusations followed, with residents piling on to denounce over 200 people. \u201cPersons of ill-repute\u201d and dedicated churchgoers alike were imprisoned and Bridget Bishop, \u201cknown for her gossipy habits and promiscuity\u201d, was the first to be hanged on 10 June. Twenty people were put to death in total with several others dying in prison.\n\nWhat caused those strange symptoms in Betty, Abigail, and their friends over three centuries ago, and ultimately led to all those deaths?\n\nOne popular theory, proposed by Linnda Caporael in Science in 1976, is that it was caused by rye fungus. The parasite, ingested accidentally from infected crops, causes \u201cconvulsive ergotism\u201d \u2013 muscle spasms, hallucinations, and seizures. Others blamed the psychoactive jimsonweed (devil\u2019s snare). Later, encephalitis lethargica, a mysterious sort of sleeping sickness possibly caused by an environmental toxin, a bacterial or viral infection or an autoimmune disorder, was invoked.\n\nIf you enjoy this, you may also like:\n\nBut these ideas have since been dismissed. For instance, key symptoms of ergot poisoning from rye fungus were absent in the Salem girls, including prominent gastrointestinal complaints, a livid skin colour, and ravenous appetites. And whilst ergot poisoning might cause LSD-type perceptual distortions (rainbow-like colours, halos, persistent after-images), the girls described well-defined figures attacking them instead.\n\nNow a new candidate has emerged, proposed by Michael Zandi, a neurologist at University College London, and one of his students, Johnny Tam, in the Journal of Neurology. That candidate is anti-NMDAR encephalitis.\n\nHere\u2019s the story of a typical patient. She initially develops a flu-like illness. Within weeks, she becomes obsessed by god or the devil, consumed by paranoia and racked with insomnia. Now, she repeats the same words, then is struck mute. Next: seizures, writhing and contorted limbs, odd repetitive movements of the mouth and tongue. Her pulse races or slows, her blood pressure rises and falls. She sweats, drools, grunts and grimaces. She becomes catatonic and then comatose.\n\nFor so long, these patients were often diagnosed as hysterics and maligned as neurotics, sent to asylums to become madder still, or to die. But now we know the condition is caused by a neurological disorder following ground-breaking research in 2007, which has shown that an offending antibody reacts against NMDA receptors \u2013 hence the term anti-NMDAR encephalitis (the \u2018R\u2019 stands for receptors).\n\nThese receptors are responsible for the synaptic transmission of signals across the brain\u2019s synapses, and neuroplasticity \u2013 the brain\u2019s capacity to adapt and change \u2013 in addition to behaviour, learning and memory. The antibody attack in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis seems to arise as part of an autoimmune response, perhaps one that occurs in the aftermath of an infection (a triggering virus such as herpes has been suggested but the jury is still out on this one).\n\nSome women with anti-NMDAR encephalitis have been found to have an ovarian tumour called a teratoma \u2013 a mass made up of hair, teeth, and bone. These tumours also have neural tissue which expresses NMDA receptors. Once again the immune system might be to blame \u2013 it\u2019s likely that these receptors trigger the production of antibodies, which then cross-react with the brain\u2019s NMDA receptors as well as those of the teratoma.\n\nIntriguingly, ketamine is also an antagonist of these receptors, which is why a ketamine overdose produces similar symptoms to anti-NMDAR encephalitis.\n\nTreatment to suppress the immune system sees 75% of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis fully recover or at least substantially so (although spontaneous improvement has been seen). For those who have an ovarian teratoma \u2013 remove this and the bewitched are de-witched. The condition has now also been identified in men, in young and old, but women are most commonly affected, frequently in their early 20\u2019s.\n\nSo could this condition be linked to Salem? Zandi and Tam analysed descriptions of Betty and Abigail and they think it\u2019s a distinct possibility for the following reasons:\n\nAnxiety and persecutory delusions feature in anti-NMDAR encephalitis and seem to have been present in the Salem girls.\n\nSeizures occur in encephalitis. The girls had \u201cseveral sore fits\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe dyskinesias (involuntary limb movements) of anti-NMDAR encephalitis might match the following description: \u2018\u2018Their limbs wracked and, tormented so ... their arms, necks, and backs turned this way and that way, and returned back again\u201d.\n\nThere are parallels between the loss of inhibition and altered mental status of encephalitis and this account: \u2018\u2018She was at first hurryed with violence to and fro in the room ... and begun to throw fire brands, about the house...\u2019\u2019\n\nThe suggestion that the girls were hallucinating: \u201cSometimes making as if she would fly, stretching up her arms as high as she could, and crying Whish, Whish, Whish!...\u2019\u2019\n\nThe fact that the girls were occasionally \u201ctaken dumb\u201d, perhaps suggestive of catatonia.\n\nBrain swelling can impair speech. The girls\u2019 \u201cmouths stopped, their throats choked...\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cTheir illnesses seem uncannily similar to a disease we\u2019ve only got a handle on in the 21st Century,\u201d says Zandi. \u201cAnd why would anti-NMDAR encephalitis not have been present then?\u201d\n\nIt sounds compelling, but some questions remain unanswered. Why would the cousins have simultaneously developed a condition that isn\u2019t infectious? Zandi points to the heritability of other autoimmune conditions, so it is possible that both suffered from the same condition, but he recognises that \u201cyes, it\u2019s more likely that only one had it than both\".\n\nAs for the rest of the girls, a great deal of mystery persists, says Zandi. \u201cSocio-political factors may have underpinned other cases, and perhaps other medical conditions may have been mislabelled as witchcraft including epilepsy,\" he says.\n\nPsychologist Nicholas Spanos also invoked the role of other factors, viewing the episode as a \u201csociopolitical drama played out in terms of the worldview shared by seventeenth-century Puritans\u201d. The girls enacted the role of demoniacs, perhaps unwittingly so, and those roles were learned in and legitimised by this religious community: \u201cAs soon as she [the accused witch] came near all fell into fits.\u201d They reported being bitten when the accused bit her lip in court. When she moved her hand, they said they\u2019d been pinched. Tellingly, they reportedly appeared healthy outside the courtroom: \u201cMany of these afflicted persons, who have scores of strange fits in a day, yet in the intervals of time are hale and hearty, robust and lusty, as tho\u2019 nothing had afflicted them.\u201d\n\nStill, the possibility of anti-NMDAR encephalitis affecting even one of the girls is intriguing, even if socio-political and religious influences drove the rest. It follows a suggestion that the 14-year-old whose story inspired The Exorcist moviehad the same form of encephalitis. Admitted to a Missouri hospital in 1949, he exhibited extreme rage, \u201cshouts in unknown tongue\u201d, and \u201cbouts of contorted postures into seemingly impossible shapes\u201d.\n\nAs for Salem, a reprieve in May 1692 saw the release of about 150 accused witches. One of the \u201cafflicted\u201d girls, Ann Putnam Jr, formally apologised, writing a letter to the church in Salem village in 1706. Betty Parris is believed to have later married and raised a family in Sudbury. The fate of Abigail Williams remains unknown. Theories around the \u201cafflicted\u201d have abounded; now anti-NMDAR encephalitis has taken its place in line. Others will surely follow.\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "text": "Image copyright Gwynedd Council Image caption Tregarth tunnel is the first in Wales to reopen for public use\n\nThree years after a study earmarked five disused Welsh railway tunnels for reopening as cycling and walking routes, one is now in use and work is under way to open two much larger projects by 2021. What has happened to make the dream of many move closer to reality?\n\nTregarth tunnel in Bethesda reopened in May last year, after four months of work and at a cost of \u00a3430,000.\n\nKnown locally as Tynal Tywyll - Dark Tunnel, in English - it now forms part of a north Wales coast to Snowdonia path.\n\nIt's made it possible to travel on foot or by bike between the villages of Tregarth and Bethesda without following the main road, making the journey safer and easier.\n\nThe journey to work from Dyffryn Ogwen to the Bangor area is also more convenient for cyclists and pedestrians, according to Gwynedd council.\n\n\"After closing the railway almost 60 years ago, the tunnel and viaduct and their special construction had been closed off to the public,\" said deputy council leader Dafydd Meurig.\n\n\"But this important project has breathed new life into an important local construction which has completed the Lon Las Ogwen route between Bangor and Bethesda.\"\n\nThe completion appears, on the face of it, to have been fairly simple.\n\nThe project was funded by the local authority and the Welsh Government. Reopening the 275m-long (900ft) tunnel was, the council says, \"straightforward in engineering terms\".\n\nThis has not been the case, however, for the longest and most widely-publicised project - the 3,148m-long Rhondda Tunnel - as Steve Mackey has discovered.\n\nImage copyright Four by 3 Image caption The Rhondda Tunnel runs between Blaenycwm in the Rhondda valley and Blaengwynfi in the Afan valley\n\nBut after a sticky start, he admits the project is now \"going so fast I can't keep up with it\".\n\nMr Mackey set up the Rhondda Tunnel Society in 2014 with the aim of sitting the tunnel's long-lost commemorative stone as near as possible to the Blaenycwm entrance.\n\nBut the venture has snowballed - the society boasts more than 700 paying members worldwide and more than 4,000 Facebook followers - and is now not only looking at opening the Rhondda Tunnel but also the second longest (2,283m) of the five, Abernant Tunnel between Merthyr Tydfil and Aberdare.\n\n\"We received a \u00a3250,000 grant from the Welsh Government [in August 2018] to help us along with the project which is now technically Rhondda and Abernant as well - they want us to open the tunnels together,\" Mr Mackey said.\n\n\"We're not experts but we've been through it all with the Rhondda Tunnel so that's why they want us on board to help.\n\n\"We're hoping to get them both up and running within three years.\"\n\nImage caption Steve Mackey said he played in the Rhondda Tunnel as a child, before it was filled in\n\nImage copyright Sustrans Image caption Abernant Tunnel is 150 years old but could be \"opened really easily\" according to Sustrans\n\nBut the grant received is a long way off the total estimated cost.\n\nMr Mackey visited the Abernant Tunnel for the first time in December but did not want to estimate the cost of reopening at this early stage, adding: \"It will probably be around \u00a37.5m for the Rhondda Tunnel alone.\"\n\nHe added that while the projects were given the backing of the local authorities in July, \"I wouldn't expect the council to pay for the whole thing\".\n\n\"We are in talks with the Heritage Lottery Fund and we've already had fantastic backing from Pen y Cymoedd Wind Farm - \u00a393,000 to spend on the detailed examination.\"\n\nThe assessment carried out in May showed 95% of the Rhondda Tunnel was in as good a condition as when it first opened.\n\nBut there is still work to be done and Gwyn Smith, from Sustrans, is cautiously optimistic.\n\nImage caption Sustrans highlighted five tunnels to be looked at as a priority and five others which are possibilities\n\nIt was his study that earmarked the tunnels for conversion.\n\n\"What's nice at the moment is Rhondda Cynon Taf council is helping to lead the project with Rhondda Tunnel Society,\" he said.\n\nHe said Sustrans, along with Merthyr Tydfil and Neath Port Talbot councils, also had \"some interest\".\n\nHe added that while the Rhondda Tunnel has \"the community behind it\", quite a lot of work has also been done on Abernant.\n\nImage copyright Steve Mackey Image caption The initial aim of the Rhondda Tunnel Society was siting the commemorative stone as close as possible to the Blaenycwm entrance\n\n\"Surveys are being completed on that tunnel, so we've got more information about the condition of it now,\" he said.\n\n\"The interesting reaction from a lot of the people is they were amazed what good condition it was in. It's 150 years old. but they could see how well built it was.\n\n\"Abernant can be opened really easily... it's not buried like the Rhondda Tunnel.\"\n\nBoth ends of the Rhondda Tunnel were covered over and landscaped after years of disuse.\n\nSo what are the next steps?\n\nImage copyright Four by 3 Image caption This portal is currently the only way to enter the Rhondda Tunnel\n\n\"One of the things we have to do is monitor the air quality [at Abernant] over the next 12 months. Each end is open so we can do that,\" Mr Smith said.\n\n\"The Rhondda Tunnel is buried, so it's not possible to do that yet. One thing that needs to be looked at is how to uncover each end.\"\n\nMerthyr council said a business plan was being developed looking at how Abernant could be managed, how to involve the community, and what the impact could be on the area's regeneration, including tourism potential and sustainable commuting opportunities between Merthyr Tydfil and Aberdare.\n\nCouncillor Geraint Thomas said it was one of a range of projects being considered by 10 local authorities in the region.\n\nImage copyright Four by 3 Image caption Sustrans has already received queries about staging events through the Rhondda Tunnel\n\nNeath Port Talbot council sees the potential of re-opening the Rhondda Tunnel to encourage walking and cycling, and Councillor Annette Wingrave said it was \"an example of how the rich industrial heritage of valleys communities can be a driver for tourism in the area\".\n\nThe Active Travel Act, which became law in 2013, was aimed at increasing the numbers of people walking and cycling to work, but a report in May showed it had had no effect.\n\nThe report was followed by an announcement of the first significant funding from the Welsh Government towards achieving that goal.\n\nImage copyright Sustrans Image caption Gwyn Smith said there was \"growing optimism\" the Usk Tunnel could be reopened\n\nImage copyright Sustrans Image caption But there are currently no plans to reopen the Pennar Tunnel\n\nOf the two remaining projects, the Usk Tunnel now features in Monmouthshire council's Integrated Network Map (INM) to improve cycling and walking routes.\n\nBut a council spokesman stressed that \"nothing has been decided yet on priorities for scheme development in 2019-20\".\n\nThe Pennar Tunnel, between Pontllanfraith and Newbridge, had not been included in Caerphilly county borough's equivalent plan."

    "text": "1. The ancient Egyptians had a god for the guts\n\nMost of us will know that when an important person died in Ancient Egypt their body was embalmed and wrapped in linen. What most of us won\u2019t be aware of is that the person\u2019s gut was removed from the body and placed in a special container called a canopic jar. It was thought to then be looked over and protected by its own God called Qebhesenuef.\n\n2. The gut used to be seen as the seat of emotion\n\nDating right back to the Ancient Greeks, the bowels rather than the heart were regarded as the seat of emotion. It was thought to be in the gut that pity, peace and compassion \u2013 or anger in some cultures \u2013 resided. Although we now refer to the heart as the seat of passion and emotion we might still say we are gutted about something when we\u2019re disappointed.\n\n3. In India, black ants were used to suture intestinal injuries\n\nIn ancient Indian medicine giant ants were used to suture - or hold together/stitch the edges - intestinal wounds. When held close to the wound, the ants would close their large jaws over the injury. The body of the ant would then be twisted off, leaving just the head clamped on. For larger injuries a whole line of ants would be used. Because they are organic, the body was thought to absorb them as it healed. Ant sutures were widely in use until as late as the 16th century!"

What do you want more of, what do you want less of?\" asks Corinne Mills, joint managing director of Personal Career Management.\n\nShe says \"just because it's a different job, it doesn't mean it's right\".\n\nHere are Corinne's top tips.\n\nAsk for advice and tell your boss you want to progress - it could lead to more opportunities without having to leave\n\nPut the hours in. If you want to get a new job, it takes time. Do research in your lunch-break, get your CV in order, work in the evenings\n\nDON'T apply for jobs if you haven't got the skills or experience - you're wasting your time\n\nDON'T just say things like: \"I'm a great team player\" - prove it.

Talk about what this relationship means for you, where do you see this going?\"\n\nIf couples think they've got things tough - it can be a rubbish time of year to be single too.\n\n\"We tend to think about relationships as something we have with another person - and actually we're not fit for that until we've cultivated the relationship with ourselves,\" says Clare.\n\n\"Spend January thinking: 'I matter, I'm a catch.' Be lovely to yourself, that'll make you feel better.\n\n\"There's nothing wrong with being single.

That's how you commit to them. But don't share them with others, keep your goals private,\" insists Ali.\n\nJust as important - don't give yourself a timescale.

The previous mark was also set by New Horizons when it flew past the dwarf planet Pluto in 2015.\n\nBut Ultima is 1.5 billion km further out.\n\nIt orbits the Sun in a region of the Solar System known as the Kuiper belt - a collection of debris and dwarf planets.\n\nThere are hundreds of thousands of Kuiper members like Ultima, and their frigid state almost certainly holds clues to how all planetary bodies came into being some 4.6 billion years ago.\n\nThe mission team thinks the two spheres that make up this particular object probably joined right at the beginning, or very shortly after.\n\nThe scientists have decided to call the larger lobe \"Ultima\", and the smaller lobe \"Thule\". The volume ratio is three to one.\n\nJeff Moore, a New Horizons co-investigator from Nasa's Ames Research Center, said the pair would have come together at very low speed, at maybe 2-3km/h. He joked: \"If you had a collision with another car at those speeds you may not even bother to fill out the insurance forms.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA/JHU-APL/SWRI Image caption Overall, Ultima Thule is dark, but there is quite a bit of brightness variation\n\nImage copyright NASA/JHU-APL/SWRI Image caption One of the probe's instruments recorded the colour (L) of Ultima Thule. This has been laid over the high-resolution B&W image (C) to produce a combination (R)\n\nThe new data from Nasa's spacecraft also shows just how dark the object is. Its brightest areas reflect just 13% of the light falling on them; the darkest, just 6%. That's similar to potting soil, said Cathy Olkin, the mission's deputy project scientist from the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI).\n\nIt has a tinge of colour, however. \"We had a rough colour from Hubble but now we can definitely say that Ultima Thule is red,\" added colleague Carly Howett, also from SwRI.\n\n\"Our current theory as to why Ultima Thule is red is the irradiation of exotic ices.\" Essentially, its surface has been \"burnt\" over the eons by the high-energy cosmic rays and X-rays that flood space.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JHU-APL/SWRI Image caption The New Horizons team is celebrating an extraordinary achievement\n\nPrincipal Investigator Alan Stern paid tribute to the skill of his team in acquiring the image as New Horizons flew past the object, reaching 3,500km from its surface at closest approach.\n\nThe probe had to target Ultima very precisely to be sure of getting it centre-frame in the view of the cameras and other instruments onboard.\n\n\"[Ultima's] only really the size of something like Washington DC, and it's about as reflective as garden variety dirt, and it's illuminated by a Sun that's 1,900 times fainter than it is outside on a sunny day here on the Earth. We were basically chasing it down in the dark at 32,000mph (51,000km/h) and all that had to happen just right,\" the SwRI scientist said.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nLess than 1% of all the data gathered by New Horizons during the flyby has been downlinked to Earth. The slow data-rates from the Kuiper belt mean it will be fully 20 months before all the information is pulled off the spacecraft.\n\nThe best of the pictures shared by the team on Wednesday were taken while the probe was still 28,000km from Ultima and discern surface features larger than 140m across. Pictures are expected in February that were captured at the moment of closest approach and these will have a resolution of about 35m per pixel.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JHU-APL/SWRI\n\nWhat's so special about the Kuiper belt?\n\nSeveral factors make Ultima Thule, and the domain in which it moves, so interesting to scientists.\n\nOne is that the Sun is so dim in this region that temperatures are down near 30-40 degrees above absolute zero - the lower end of the temperature scale and the coldest atoms and molecules can possibly get. As a result, chemical reactions have essentially stalled. This means Ultima is in such a deep freeze that it is probably perfectly preserved in the state in which it formed.\n\nAnother factor is that Ultima is small (about 33km in the longest dimension), and this means it doesn't have the type of \"geological engine\" that in larger objects will rework their composition.\n\nAnd a third factor is just the nature of the environment. It's very sedate in the Kuiper belt.\n\nUnlike in the inner Solar System, there are probably very few collisions between objects. The Kuiper belt hasn't been stirred up.\n\nProf Stern said: \"Everything that we're going to learn about Ultima - from its composition to its geology, to how it was originally assembled, whether it has satellites and an atmosphere, and that kind of thing - is going to teach us about the original formation conditions in the Solar System that all the other objects we've gone out and orbited, flown by and landed on can't tell us because they're either large and evolve, or they are warm. Ultima is unique.\"\n\nWhat does New Horizons do next?\n\nFirst, the scientists must work on the Ultima data, but they will also ask Nasa to fund a further extension to the mission.\n\nThe hope is that the course of the spacecraft can be altered slightly to visit at least one more Kuiper belt object sometime in the next decade.\n\nNew Horizons should have just enough fuel reserves to be able to do this. Critically, it should also have sufficient electrical reserves to keep operating its instruments into the 2030s.\n\nThe longevity of New Horizon's plutonium battery may even allow it to record its exit from the Solar System.\n\nThe two 1970s Voyager missions have both now left the heliosphere - the bubble of gas blown off our Sun (one definition of the Solar System's domain). Voyager 2 only recently did it, in November.\n\nAnd in case you were wondering, New Horizons will never match the Voyagers in terms of distance travelled from Earth. Although New Horizons was the fastest spacecraft ever launched in 2006, it continues to lose ground to the older missions. The reason: the Voyagers got a gravitational speed boost when they passed the outer planets. Voyager-1 is now moving at almost 17km/s; New Horizons is moving at 14km/s.\n\nThe BBC's Sky At Night programme will broadcast a special episode on the flyby on Sunday 13 January on BBC Four at 22:30 GMT. Presenter Chris Lintott will review the event and discuss some of the new science to emerge from the encounter with the New Horizons team.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"

    "text": "Image copyright Michael Traill Image caption The ice pancake was photographed on Friday\n\nAn unusual circle of ice has been photographed in Aberdeenshire amid sub-zero temperatures.\n\nThe phenomenon, known as an ice pancake, was seen at the River Dee near Braemar - where temperatures dropped to -10.5C (13F) earlier this week.\n\nThey are not thought to be a common sight in Scotland.\n\nThe Met Office said they were most frequently found in the Baltic Sea and around Antarctica, and were also seen in the US and Canada.\n\nBBC Scotland weather forecaster and presenter Anne Lundon said: \"Ice circles are slowly rotating discs of ice that look almost like frozen lily pads.\n\n\"They aren't all that common in Scotland - they are most frequently observed in colder climates.\n\n\"I suspect the temperature drop in Braemar would have had something to do with this.\"\n\nImage copyright Michael Traill\n\nThe area saw the lowest temperature of the winter so far on Wednesday night into Thursday morning.\n\nMet Office spokeswoman Nicky Maxey said the size of the circle in Braemar meant it was \"relatively unusual\".\n\nShe added: \"They form because the temperature is cold and ice crystals form. They bump into each other and form these ice pancakes.\""

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A woman collecting plastic at a waste dump in Indonesia - in the year to October, the country received 63,000 tonnes of UK plastic\n\nA year ago, experts warned that the UK could face a mountain of waste plastic as China imposed a ban on waste imports.\n\nIn recent years, the UK has heavily relied on China to take our unwanted plastic packaging. Three years ago, the UK was exporting half a million tonnes of plastic to China and Hong Kong - accounting for almost two-thirds of all our plastic sent abroad.\n\nChina introduced its ban on \"foreign garbage\" as part of a move to upgrade its industries 12 months ago. At the time, the UK recycling industry warned that the decision would be a \"game-changer\" and that it would be a struggle to deal with the country's waste.\n\nWhere is that plastic mountain?\n\nWell, it hasn't appeared - partly thanks to other countries taking our waste plastic instead, and partly because we are burning more of it.\n\nIn the wake of mass public alarm about plastic pollution we may also be producing less plastic waste, although it's impossible to be sure of the figures\n\nWho has taken our waste instead of China?\n\nIn the 12 months to October 2018, our analysis of Environment Agency figures shows that the UK exported a total of 611,000 tonnes of recovered plastic packaging to other countries.\n\nIn the previous 12-month period (ie to October 2017), the UK exported 683,000 tonnes.\n\nSo that works out as a drop in exports of 72,000 between 2016-17 and 2017-2018.\n\nIt's clear that other countries have imported much of the plastic packaging previously reprocessed by China.\n\nBut incineration in the UK has also increased, and we may be seeing the benefits of the Blue Planet effect on public behaviour.\n\nThe fact is we can't be certain from the data what exactly has happened to the shortfall.\n\nWhere did our plastic packaging go in 2018?\n\nWell, where there's waste plastic there's potentially profit - because some of it can be lucratively recycled. So some nations have geared up their reprocessing plants to welcome our waste with open arms.\n\nMany Chinese recyclers moved their operations abroad to benefit from cheap flows of plastic in the region before then re-exporting it back to China as recycled pellets.\n\nBut not all of it has been welcomed. Several countries including Indonesia, Vietnam and Taiwan have heavily restricted imports because shipments were blocking ports and the quality of the material being imported (from all countries) was poor.\n\nSo while the amount of plastic taken by China dropped by 94% between 2016-17 and 2017-18, Malaysia, Turkey, Poland and Indonesia led the pack in gobbling up the slack.\n\nMalaysia imported 105,000 tonnes in total and was way out in front. That total was 42,000 (68%) more in 2017-18 compared with the previous year.\n\nThe second most popular destination was Turkey (80,000 tonnes).\n\nPoland is in third place on the league table - although it actually received slightly less UK plastic in 2017-18 than it did in 2016-17. It's not clear why.\n\nIn fourth place is Indonesia, which along with Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam - is in the top 10 for the quantity of waste plastics polluting the ocean.\n\nWhich countries recorded the biggest increase in UK plastic over the period?\n\nAnother way of analysing the data is to rank the numbers in terms of net increase (ie which countries recorded the biggest increase in 2017-18 compared with 2016-17).\n\nOn this measure, Malaysia and Turkey remain at the top while Indonesia stays in the top five.\n\nThe new entries (replacing Poland and the Netherlands) are Spain and France. Spain recorded an increase of 14,000 between 2016-17 and 2017-18, and France was just behind on 9,000.\n\nOf course, sending material abroad for recycling doesn't necessarily mean it actually gets recycled.\n\nWaste firms in the receiving country may sift through the rubbish, take out the economically valuable material and burn or even dump the rest. The waste industry is notorious in some places for its links with criminal activity.\n\nThe global illegal waste trade is estimated by the UN to be worth between \u00a38bn-\u00a39.5bn a year.\n\nCase study: Malaysia\n\nImage copyright Mageswari Sangaralingam Image caption Campaigners say illegal waste dumps in Malaysia have become a problem since China's plastic import ban\n\nSince China's ban, Malaysia has seen a big surge in the amount of plastic it has received from abroad, including from the UK.\n\n\"Malaysia is not able to process all of the imported waste, there are limited plastic waste factories\", says Mageswari Sangaralingam who works for the Consumers' Association of Penang and for Friends of the Earth, Malaysia.\n\nAccording to Ms Sangaralingam, not only is Malaysia receiving more plastic than it can properly dispose of, some of it is low-grade which ends up as landfill. There are also some rogue recyclers who, she says, burn plastic in the open - leading to environmental harm.\n\nThe Malaysian government has announced stricter conditions on the import of plastic and says it wants to phase it out over the next three years - but Ms Sangaralingam wants an immediate outright ban.\n\n\"Malaysia is not a dumping ground and hence should stop importing plastic waste,\" she says.\n\nImage copyright Mageswari Sangaralingam Image caption Could Malaysia follow China's lead and ban plastic imports outright?\n\nWhat's the UK doing about the issue?\n\nThe British Plastics Federation (BPF) told us it was \"very worried\" about the export of poor quality plastic waste. The chairman of its recycling group, Roger Baynham, told us all that UK companies should make the very best efforts to ensure plastic goes to reputable recyclers:\n\n\"The export of plastic waste is out of the control of the industry and the BPF is particularly concerned about recent reports of illegal and fraudulent exports of plastic packaging waste routed to Asia through Holland.\"\n\nThe BPF also told us it would support a global accreditation system for the waste export sector and that recycling should be done at home.\n\nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove says the UK must stop \"off-shoring its dirt\". We asked the UK government why it didn't simply ban the export of waste plastic.\n\nWe were told that while the UK was committed to \"recycling more at home\" there is a \"legitimate export market for plastics particularly for countries that manufacture new products out of recycled plastic waste\".\n\nMr Gove wants to stimulate more recycling, but UK firms wanting to process more waste in Britain complain it's hard to get funding.\n\n\"There are very few countries left where we can comfortably export to and the market is shrinking,\" warns Simon Ellin, chief executive of the UK Recycling Association.\n\n\"People don't want to buy this material, so where on earth is this all going to go?\" he adds.\n\nMr Ellin is largely supportive of the government's new waste strategy plan, but says the UK must expand its processing capacity at a faster pace:\n\n\"We're almost at a crisis point, unless we get a plan quickly,\" he says.\n\nLess than half of all household waste is recycled\n\nOverall recycling figures have stagnated and some councils are burning 80% of all residual waste, including recyclable plastic and paper.\n\nIn the 12 months to March, 50 of 123 councils incinerated more than half the household rubbish they collected, including plastic and paper, official figures recently revealed. The worst are in London. Westminster burned 82% of all household rubbish.\n\nLess than half of all household waste (45.2%) was recycled in 2017 - a minuscule rise of just 0.3% on the previous year. The UK now seems unlikely to reach the EU-enforced target of 50% recycling in the next two years.\n\nThe Western Riverside Waste Authority, which covers Hammersmith and Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth and Wandsworth, incinerated 79% as did Lewisham and Tower Hamlets. Slough, Kirklees, Sunderland, Portsmouth and Birmingham councils all incinerated at least 70% of all plastic, paper and household rubbish.\n\nSwindon Borough Council said in November it wants to burn plastic along with other rubbish rather than sending it abroad for recycling - saying some \"isn't properly recycled\".\n\nAnalysis by the BBC suggests that recycling rates are being hindered by the myriad of different rules which are in play up and down the country. It found that nearly half (47%) of Britons asked said they disagree about what should and should not be recycled.\n\nClaire Shrewsbury, from the recycling body Wrap, told BBC News: \"The time has come for the UK to take more responsibility for its own recovered materials, and move towards a circular system for plastics and other materials.\n\n\"There is a global market for high quality resource exports to countries that manufacture products, and this is something the UK should explore.\n\n\"This will require fundamental change from all of us. And that means regulatory transformation, collaborative industry action, together with citizen behaviour change.\"\n\nMs Shrewsbury aims her comments at anyone who buys stuff and throws packaging away.\n\nThat's all of us.\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter"

    "text": "How to hack your year This story is part of a series we\u2019re running on how to \u2018hack\u2019 your year. We\u2019ll be looking at the best time of year to get engaged, buy a house, sit an exam, go to hospital and more. Keep checking back through December here for more stories.\n\nWhen we\u2019re trying to make a big decision, many of us think (and over-think) about the choice itself. If we\u2019re really analytical, we might also think about our decision-making process: should we write up a list of pro\u2019s and cons, or make a weighted spreadsheet? Research endlessly, or cut ourselves off from accumulating too much data?\n\nBut as well as thinking about how to make a choice, we may also want to think about when to make it.\n\nWhether it\u2019s changing careers or buying a house, January always feels like a prime time for a reset \u2013 or, at least, to decide on a reset. And many of us are returning from holiday, where free time and conversations with loved ones can make us think about our life choices.\n\nBut is January really the best time to make a big decision?\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 Should you trust your gut feelings?\n\n\u2022 Why contemplating death changes how you think\n\n\u2022 How good are you at thinking about uncertainty?\n\nThe answer depends on our mood.\n\nMany of us find that we feel a little lower in winter. For some people, it can be extreme. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD), marked by having depressive episodes in the winter months, is especially common in northern latitudes. One review found that up to almost 10% of people in the north, including North America, are affected by the disorder, while a recent study in Switzerland following participants over more than 20 years found that 7.5% of the population experienced seasonal depression.\n\nSymptoms also can last for longer than you might expect: one study found that in the US, those affected by SAD struggle with symptoms for an average 40% of the year.\n\nBut even those who don\u2019t meet the diagnostic criteria for SAD often feel that their mood is lower in the winter. Back in the 1980s, a telephone survey of Maryland residents found 92% of people noticed seasonal mood changes to some degree \u2013 mainly that their mood became lower in winter.\n\nYour mood doesn\u2019t just affect how you feel. It can affect your decision-making abilities. But to make matters more complex, having a low mood doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll always be worse at making a choice.\n\nReward risk\n\nA depressed mood tends to make us more risk-averse. Researchers think this may stem from a curtailed ability to experience pleasure, meaning a depressed person doesn\u2019t have the same potent (and optimistic) emotional response to the possibility of a gain or a reward as a non-depressed person.\n\nWhen given a card-playing task designed to assess risk-taking, for example, depressed participants had a harder time remembering which options were more likely to yield rewards, making them worse at the game than non-depressed participants. Participants with depressive symptoms also were more conservative in their risk-taking than non-depressed participants \u2013 sticking with safe choices that had low chances of reward, instead of adopting higher-risk strategies with potentially larger payoffs.\n\nThese are laboratory studies, but there is some good evidence that the same effects play out in the real world. People with SAD are more likely to be conservative in their financial decisions in the winter than people who didn\u2019t have SAD, for instance.\n\nAnd when it comes to making decisions, being more risk-averse isn\u2019t always a bad thing.\n\nThis is especially true because most healthy individuals have the opposite problem: \u2018optimism bias\u2019. Most of us believe we\u2019re less likely to experience a negative event (like getting cancer or being in a car crash) than the statistics would warrant, and that our future is likelier to be rosier (whether in terms of getting more job offers or having a great holiday) than actually turns out to be the case. We also tend to think that we\u2019re more in control than we really are \u2013 particularly if we\u2019re involved in the event ourselves.\n\nAs you might expect, depressed people, who have a more pessimistic view of the world, don\u2019t fall into this trap. This \u2018depressive realism\u2019 means they are better at accurately assessing time intervals and at predicting how other people's decisions will affect them than their more optimistic peers. They also learn to avoid risky responses faster than non-depressed people.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re accurate with forecasting in general \u2013 depressed people are worse than healthy people at predicting football World Cup match results for example.\n\nThere is another twist, too. Optimists may see the future with rose-coloured glasses \u2013 but they\u2019re also better at making that future come true. Greater optimism is associated with more career success, better relationships and better health. Long-running studies also have found that the effect seems to go beyond correlation (\u2018I\u2019m optimistic because I\u2019m in good health\u2019) and perhaps be causation (\u2018My optimism helps me have good health\u2019). One study, for example, looked at 97,000 women, all of whom had no cancer or cardiovascular disease when the study began. Eight years later, the optimists were less likely than pessimists to have developed coronary heart disease or have died of any cause.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re struggling to make a life choice, it may also be worth waiting until longer days bring a lighter mood: depressive symptoms can interfere with the decision making process that that it is harder to make any decision at all, with people with depression feeling more conflicted and indecisive than non-depressed people.\n\nSo the relationship between mood and decision-making is not a simple one \u2013 which means that if you\u2019re considering when to make a big decision, you may want to think about what kind it is. Does it involve potentially catastrophic losses \u2013 something that may require caution and a realistic outlook? Then winter may be better. Or is it a decision where there\u2019s everything to play for, if you can accept a certain amount of uncertainty about the outcome? Then perhaps you should take advantage of your more elevated mood in summer.\n\nAnd if you feel stymied from making a choice at all, you might want to wait a bit until sunshine returns. Who knows \u2013 it may help clear up not only your mood, but your indecision.\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption It is hoped the law will encourage pet adoptions\n\nCalifornia is set to become the first state in the US to ban the sale of non-rescue animals in pet shops.\n\nThe new law, known as AB 485, takes effect on 1 January. Any businesses violating it face a $500 (\u00a3400) fine.\n\nThe change means cats, dogs and rabbits sold by retailers cannot be sourced from breeders, only from animal shelters.\n\nAnimal rights groups have heralded it as a step forward against so-called \"kitten factories\" and \"puppy mills\".\n\nThey say the current \"high-volume\" industries, where pets are bred for profit, can lead to inhumane treatment and long-term emotional and physical health problems in some animals.\n\nThe new state-wide law, approved in late 2017, will now require shops to maintain sufficient records of where they sourced each animal, for periodic checks by authorities.\n\nIt does not, however, affect sales from private breeders or owner-to-owner sales.\n\nSome Californian shop owners have raised concern the law could put them out of business. The measure has also seen resistance from the American Kennel Club, which said it limits pet owners.\n\nAccording to American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) estimates, more than 6.5 million pets enter shelters across the country every year, of which about 1.5 million are put down.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption It is estimated that more than than 860,000 cats are euthanised in the US every year\n\nThe California assembly member who introduced the legislation, Patrick O'Donnell, has insisted the legislation is not just \"a big win\" for \"four-legged friends\", but for California taxpayers too, as they spend hundreds of millions on sheltering animals across the state.\n\nA couple hoping to adopt a cat from a San Diego shelter on Friday, told NBC News the move was a step forward for the state.\n\n\"It takes the emphasis off the profit of animals and puts the emphasis back on caring for and getting these cats and dogs a good home,\" prospective owner Mitch Kentdotson said.\n\nAB 485 is the first state-wide law of its kind, although other places have enacted similar regulations on pet sales on a local level.\n\nEarlier this month, a similar ban on third-party puppy and kitten sales was confirmed in England.\n\nLucy's law, named after a mistreated cavalier King Charles spaniel, also aims to combat low-welfare animal breeding."

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Building self-awareness, through things like meditation, can boost our mental and physical wellbeing\n\nIf you are contemplating a new year's health kick, you could be forgiven for feeling a little overwhelmed.\n\nDo yoga, run, lift weights, cut the carbs, or the fat (depending on the particular diet that's in vogue), ditch the booze, reduce your stress.\n\nIt is easy to feel like your life needs to be overhauled in order to be a healthy, happy human being.\n\nBut what if you were to make only one change?\n\nWe asked experts what single thing they would recommend people should do to improve their health, assuming they are an adult who is otherwise healthy and not a smoker.\n\nFocus on the mind\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIt is easy to only think about our physical health.\n\nBut according to Dr Nadine Sammy, associate lecturer for sport and exercise sciences at the University of Exeter, we should also be focusing on improving our minds by building self-awareness.\n\nYou might think of this as something that prevents us from embarrassing ourselves, but, according to Dr Sammy, it is much more than this.\n\nSelf-awareness is the ability to recognise and understand your moods, emotions and drives, and building it can play a crucial role in improving mental and physical wellbeing over time.\n\n\"By understanding your feelings, motivations and behaviours in more depth, you can begin to act more consciously in order to make better choices for yourself,\" she says.\n\n\"For instance, what is your motivation to exercise? When are you most - and when are you least - likely to stick to your exercise routine and why?\"\n\nThere are many ways to do this, she says, including journaling, meditating, practicing mindfulness or simply making time for self-reflection after certain activities or at the end of the day.\n\n\"Better understanding ourselves allows us to play to our strengths and build on our weaknesses, thereby spurring us on to be our best self,\" she adds.\n\nAdopt a dog\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption There are particular health benefits in adopting a dog, says Dr Rhys Thatcher\n\nA gym membership, a pilates class, or a morning run - just some of the things that might come to mind when we think of becoming physically more active.\n\nBut though going to the gym works for some of us, many will quit after a month or two, says Dr Rhys Thatcher, a reader in exercise physiology at Aberystwyth University.\n\nInstead, he recommends finding ways to routinely incorporate exercise into our daily lives.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to do this, from avoiding the lifts at work to parking on the far side of a supermarket car park when you are doing the shopping.\n\nBut there are particular benefits to adopting a dog, he says.\n\nIf you make sure to walk it for at least 30 minutes twice a day, you will be boosting your activity while also getting the emotional benefits of dog adoption.\n\n\"This way you get to spend time outside, you get to exercise, you get a loyal companion and at the same time you get to improve the life of another living thing, all of which have been shown to improve physical and mental health,\" says Dr Thatcher.\n\nGet your 30 a week\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Experts say diversity of plant-based foods is also important\n\nWe have all heard about getting our five portions of fruit and vegetables a day.\n\nBut according to Dr Megan Rossi, a research fellow at King's College London's department of nutritional sciences, it is not only quantity we should be striving for, but also diversity.\n\nWe should aim for at least 30 different plant-based foods per week, she says.\n\nThat is because plant-based diversity is thought to have a key role in good gut health.\n\nThe bacteria in our gut - collectively known as the microbiome - have a profound role in our health.\n\nAllergies, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinson's, and even depression have all been linked to the bacteria in our gut.\n\nOne way we can get more plant-based diversity in our diets easily is by being a little savvier about some of the foods we purchase, says Dr Rossi.\n\n\"Instead of just buying chickpeas go for the four-bean mix. Instead of buying one type of seed buy the four-seed mix,\" she says.\n\nSmile more often\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Do not spend so much time focusing on arbitrary matters, do something that makes you smile instead\n\nAfter the excesses of the holiday season, many of us will be planning to lose a couple of stone or setting a target for how many times we go to the gym each week.\n\nBut the problem with \"arbitrary\" goals like these is that they are often difficult to achieve and failing to reach them can be demoralising, says Dr James Gill.\n\nInstead, he recommends focusing first on trying to be happier.\n\n\"There are lists of specific things that you can do to actively make your life healthier, but if you are not enjoying your life you probably won't stick to any difficult or challenging changes for the coming year,\" says Dr Gill, a locum GP and researcher at Warwick Medical School.\n\nBut how do you go about becoming happier?\n\nDr Gill recommends making one change in your life that will make you smile more often. At the same time, identify one thing that makes you unhappy and try to do something to improve it.\n\n\"Get those two in the bag, and you'll be ready to look to other things to really give your health a boost further into the year.\"\n\nAnd finally, get enough sleep\n\nIt may seem obvious, but we should all aim to get enough sleep (seven to nine hours a night for most healthy adults).\n\nEven being mildly deprived of it (five hours a night) can affect a range of cognitive functions, including decision making, says Dr Gavin Buckingham, senior lecturer in sport and health sciences at the University of Exeter.\n\nThere are lots of things we can do to get a better night's sleep, from avoiding caffeine too close to bed to having a consistent bedtime.\n\nBut Dr Buckingham's top tip is to stop using electronic devices like phones and laptops well before bedtime or at least put on a filter that blocks the blue light in them.\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter."

    "text": "After writing Fungus the Bogeyman, Briggs had the desire to create something very different in tone and style. The result was a book which catapulted him to a much greater level of recognition: The Snowman.\n\nHaving taken you through that wonderful relationship, he doesn\u2019t shy away from death and the inevitability of life Nick Park\n\nBriggs says: \"It was done as a reaction. I'd been two years immersed in all this slime and muck and wanted to do something different. Something lighter and quicker, less laborious, no words, just for the sake of a change.\"\n\nHis long-time editor, Julia MacRae, felt overwhelmed with emotion when Briggs first showed her the work.\n\nShe recalls: \"He didn't like to be in the room when I was looking at his work, he'd go outside. He came back in and he found me in floods of tears and said, 'You don't like it?' and I said, 'Raymond, they're just tears of pure joy because it's just so beautiful'.\"\n\nThe book, first published in 1978, feels as if it was drawn by a child as Briggs drew with coloured pencils. It went on to form the basis for an animated film of the same name that was released in 1982, although there is no reference to Christmas in the book. (Briggs initially saw this addition as \"corny and twee\" but he admitted \"it worked extremely well\".)\n\nWallace and Gromit creator Nick Park recalls the thrill of seeing the famous flying sequence when he was a film student.\n\nPark says: \"They only had a clip ready and they showed it as a treat at the London Film Festival. I remember hearing about it and I was so thrilled to see it. For me it was like a dream come true - I was just so hoping it would reflect his original comic book artwork and it did. It was a real groundbreaker.\"\n\nIt might be a children's story but it doesn't shy away from life being temporary, as is reflected in the ultimate demise of the Snowman. Park adds: \"At the end there is that harsh reality of what happens to a snowman, and having taken you through that wonderful relationship that developed, he doesn\u2019t shy away from death and the inevitability of life.\""

But unfortunately for him, in both settings he very quickly became ill when he was eating lean meats without any fat. He developed \"protein poisoning\u201d, nicknamed \u201crabbit starvation\u201d. His symptoms disappeared after he lowered his protein intake and he raised his fat intake. In fact, after returning to New York City and to a typical US diet with more normal levels of protein, he reportedly found his health deteriorating and returned to a low-carb, high fat, and high protein diet until his death aged 83.\n\nHis early experiments are some of the few recorded cases of high protein intake having extreme adverse effects \u2013 but despite soaring sales of protein supplements, many of us are still unsure how much protein we need, how best to consume it, and if too much, or too little, is dangerous.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 The secrets of microwave meals\n\n\u2022 Why doesn\u2019t dried meat kill us?\n\n\u2022 What causes us to get hangry?\n\nDespite obesity rates doubling over the past two decades, we\u2019re becoming increasingly conscious of what we\u2019re eating. In recent years many of us have swapped white bread for brown and wholemeal bread and full-fat milk for skimmed. Taking centre stage in our health kick is protein, with protein balls, bars and enhanced protein versions of staple products, from cereals to soup, dominating supermarket shelves. And with the global protein supplements market valued at $12.4bn (\u00a39.2bn) in 2016, it\u2019s clear we\u2019re buying into the idea that we need as much protein as possible.\n\nBut some experts now argue that foods with inflated protein (and prices) are a waste of money.\n\nProtein is essential for the body to grow and repair. Protein-rich food such as dairy, meat, eggs, fish and beans are broken down into amino acids in the stomach and absorbed in the small intestine, then the liver sorts out which amino acids the body needs. The rest is flushed out in our urine.\n\nAdults who aren\u2019t especially active are advised to eat roughly 0.75g of protein per day for each kilogram they weigh. On average, this is 55g for men and 45g for women \u2013 or two palm-sized portions of meat, fish, tofu, nuts or pulses.\n\nNot getting enough protein can lead to hair loss, skin breakouts and weight loss as muscle mass decreases. But these side effects are very rare, and largely only occur in those with eating disorders.\n\nDespite that, most of us have long associated protein with building muscle. This is accurate. Strength-based exercise causes a breakdown of protein in the muscle. For muscles to grow stronger, the proteins need to rebuild. A type of amino acid called leucine plays a particularly big part in triggering protein synthesis.\n\nSome experts even argue that not consuming protein post-workout could cause the breakdown of muscle to be higher than the synthesis \u2013 meaning there\u2019s no net gain in muscle mass. Supplement brands advise drinking protein shakes after a workout to help the growth and repair of muscle tissue, usually in the form of leucine-rich whey protein, a by-product of making cheese.\n\nMany consumers agree. Research company Mintel\u2019s 2017 Report found that 27% of Brits use sport nutrition products such as protein bars and shakes. This figure rises to 39% for those who exercise more than once a week. But more than half of the individuals who use the products (63%) find it difficult to tell whether they\u2019re having any effect.\n\nProtein bars are really just candy bars with a bit of extra protein\n\nIndeed, research on the muscle-building power of protein supplements is varied. A 2014 analysis of 36 papers found that protein supplements have no impact on lean mass and muscle strength during the first few weeks of resistance training in untrained individuals.\n\nOver time and if the training becomes harder, supplements can promote muscle growth. However, the paper also concludes that these changes have not been proven over the long term. A 2012 review paper further says that protein \u201cincreases physical performance, training recovery and lean body mass\u201d\u2026 but for the benefit to be optimal, it should be in combination with a fast-acting carbohydrate.\n\nBut even if athletes and gym goers may benefit from a post-workout protein boost, that doesn\u2019t mean they should reach for the supplements and smoothies. Most people get more than their daily recommended allowance from food, says Kevin Tipton, a sport professor of the University of Stirling. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for anyone to have supplements. They\u2019re a convenient way to get protein, but there\u2019s nothing in supplements you can\u2019t get in food. Protein bars are really just candy bars with a bit of extra protein.\u201d\n\nTipton adds that even among bodybuilders, products like whey protein aren\u2019t as critical as they are hyped up to be. \u201cThere\u2019s too much focus on which supplements to take, as opposed to getting in the gym and working harder. There are so many other variables, such as sleep, stress and diet,\u201d he says.\n\nWe need to maintain our muscle mass as we age, because we become less active and frail\n\nMost experts agree with Tipton that protein is best consumed in food instead of supplements. But there are some exceptions, such as athletes who find it difficult to hit their daily protein targets, points out Graeme Close, professor of human physiology at Liverpool John Moores University. \u201cI believe most need more than the recommended daily allowance, and there\u2019s good evidence to support this,\u201d he says. In this case, he says, a shake can be useful.\n\nAnother demographic who can benefit from extra protein? The elderly. That\u2019s because as we age, we need more protein to retain muscle mass. But we also tend to eat less protein as we get older because our taste-buds begin to prefer sweet over savoury.\n\nEmma Stevenson, professor of sport and exercise science at Newcastle University, is working with food companies to get more protein into snacks that the elderly are known to regularly buy, such as biscuits. \u201cWe need to maintain our muscle mass as we age, because we become less active and frail,\u201d she says.\n\nClose says the elderly should increase protein intake to around 1.2g per kg body weight.\n\nFortunately, it\u2019s difficult to have too much protein. While we do have an upper limit of protein intake, it\u2019s \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to reach, says Tipton. \u201cThere are concerns among some dieticians that a high protein diet can hurt the kidneys and bones, but evidence in otherwise healthy people is minimal. It is possible there could be a problem if someone with an underlying kidney [issue] eats high amounts of protein, but the odds of any adverse effects are very low.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to lose weight, it\u2019s more important to have a high-protein breakfast\n\nBut while protein itself isn\u2019t harmful, many protein supplements are high in carbohydrates called FODMAPs that trigger digestive symptoms like bloating, gas and stomach pain. Stevenson advises reading labels carefully on supplements, bars and balls. \u201cOften, they\u2019re very high in calories and contain huge amounts of carbs, often in form of sugar. You shouldn\u2019t necessarily think that because it says it\u2019s high protein that its healthy,\u201d she says.\n\nWeight loss\n\nProtein has long been linked to weight loss, with low-carb, high-protein diets such as Paleo and Atkins promising to prolong the feeling of fullness. People fail to lose weight often because they feel hungry, and MRI studies have shown that a high-protein breakfast can help stop cravings later in the day.\n\nThere is sufficient evidence that protein is satiating, says Alex Johnstone of the University of Aberdeen. If you\u2019re trying to lose weight, it\u2019s therefore more important to have a high-protein breakfast, such as beans on toast or a dairy smoothie, rather than to have supplements.\n\nBut she doesn\u2019t advocate \u201cAtkins-type\u201d diets and has found that cutting out carbohydrates has adverse affects on gut health (and we now know that maintaining a healthy gut is crucial to many aspects of our health and well-being).\n\nInstead, Johnstone recommends that overweight people eat a high-protein and moderate-carb diet, consisting of 30% protein, 40% carbs and 30% fat \u2013 compared to the average diet of around 15% protein, 55% carbs and 30% fat.\n\nBut, of course, upping protein intake alone won\u2019t help you lose weight. Choosing lean meat such as chicken or fish is key. Studies also show that eating large amounts of animal protein is linked to weight gain and red meat in particular is linked to an increased risk of cancer as well as heart disease.\n\nConsuming more protein than need is wasteful in terms of money, and it\u2019s paid down the toilet\n\nThere are, though, healthy proteins which are not meat, such as mycoprotein, which is derived from fungi. Quorn, for example, contains this type of protein, and is high in fibre too.\n\nResearchers now are looking into how this unique composition (of both protein and fibre) can affect satiety and insulin levels, which are linked to type two diabetes. One team compared a mycoprotein diet to a chicken diet and found that the insulin levels in those who ate quorn achieved the same sugar control, but needed less insulin to be produced by the pancreas.\n\nThe risk of consuming too much protein is small, but the bigger risk might just be falling for overpriced products offering us more protein than we need. \u201cSome products labelled as high protein aren\u2019t, and they\u2019re quite expensive. Anyway, consuming more protein than need is wasteful in terms of money, and it\u2019s paid down the toilet,\u201d says Johnstone.\n\n--\n\nJoin 800,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "text": "Image copyright WWF Image caption The entire species of Javan rhinos could be wiped out by a tsunami\n\nConservationists have warned that the entire species of the critically endangered Javan rhino could be wiped out if a tsunami were to strike again.\n\nThey once roamed the jungles of South East Asia and India, but today only 67 exist in the Ujung Kulon National Park, which was hit by last week's tsunami.\n\nThe park sits in the shadow of Anak Krakatau, the volcano which triggered waves that killed hundreds of people.\n\nThe volcano remains active and officials are now rushing to move them.\n\nTwo park officials were among the 430 killed by the tsunami, and numerous park buildings and ships were also destroyed when the tsunami hit last Saturday.\n\nBut the Javan rhinos left in the park - the only ones left in the world - were left unscathed.\n\nThe rhinos typically live along the park's south coast and this tsunami hit the north coast - many are keenly aware that the rhinos might not be so lucky if there is another disaster.\n\nAn entire species in danger\n\nThe Javan rhinos are the most threatened of the five rhino species in the world - and have been listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List.\n\nThey were once found in northeast India and across South East Asia but their population was quickly depleted as a result of poaching, habitat destruction through agriculture, among other factors.\n\nImage copyright Wwf Image caption Only 67 Javan rhinos exist today\n\nAccording to the WWF, Vietnam's last Javan rhino was poached in 2010.\n\n\"As there are no Javan rhinos in captivity anywhere in the world, should we lose this population, we've essentially lost the entire species,\" said Nicola Loweth, a WWF officer in a statement about the rhinos in Indonesia.\n\nThe search for the perfect location\n\nAnak Krakatau began showing increased signs of volcanic activity since June earlier this year.\n\nBut it was last Saturday that volcanic activity from Anak Krakatau is believed to have set off undersea landslides, triggering a tsunami that has killed at least 430 people so far.\n\nAuthorities say Anak Krakatau is still active, and is in fact becoming increasingly active with what are known as Strombolian eruptions - short lived, explosive blasts of lava - being emitted.\n\n\"We understand that we cannot let the Javan rhinos live only in Ujung Julon,\" Widodo Sukohadi Ramono, chairman of the Rhino Foundation of Indonesian (YABI) told BBC News Indonesia.\n\nMr Ramono added that there were plans in place to move a smaller group of rhinos to a secondary location, though there was \"a lot [to be taken into] consideration\".\n\nThe rhinos which would be moved would have to be in good health, have close ties to each other and able to reproduce.\n\nBut moving the rhinos to another location is easier said than done.\n\nThe new location would have to have more than 200 species of plants - food sources for the Javan rhino. It would also need to have a plentiful water supply, an ideal soil type, land condition and a place with a year-round wet climate.\n\n\"It's difficult to find the perfect location... we need at least five thousand hectares in one location. It has to provide [the rhinos] with [suitable] food, water. We need to know what diseases exist there, if there are predators, how supportive the local community is,\" the head of TNUK, Mamat Rahmat told BBC News Indonesia.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Javan rhinos need to live in a year-long wet climate\n\nGovernment officials have been looking for years to find a suitable second location for the Javan rhinos. They were supposed to have found one in 2017 - but this never materialised.\n\n\"Sometimes the plan [does not] work out,\" said Mr Mamat. \"There are many obstacles, technical factors, internal constraints and external factors [to take into consideration].\"\n\nMr Mamat adds that the government has surveyed 10 possible locations, of which one has arisen as a suitable candidate - the Cikepuh Wildlife Reserve in West Java.\n\nHowever, this was not without its problems.\n\n\"There is an agreement [there] with the army about the use of land for combat drills. We need to do further studies on how the [sound] of guns and cannons could [impact] the rhinos.\"\n\nHuman activity also exists around the wildlife reserve - which could put the rhinos at risk.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A rhino footprint at the Ujung Kulon National Parl\n\nThe plan to move to the Cikepuh Wildlife Reserve appears to have stalled, but after the recent tsunami officials are once again moving with urgency.\n\n\"We [will] take more steps quickly in preparing a second habitat [for the rhinos],\" said Mr Mamat.\n\n\"If one day Ujung Kulon is hit by an eruption, then [we would hope] there would still be reserves [of Javan rhinos] in a new place.\"\n\nReporting by BBC Indonesia's Rivan Dwiastono.

    "text": "Dame June Whitfield was a constant presence in British post-war comedy.\n\nOften playing the female stooge to some of Britain's most famous entertainers, she called herself \"a comic's tart\".\n\nBut after six decades on radio and television, she established herself as a star in her own right.\n\nThe actress always said she was \"very bad at getting round to things\".\n\nBut from her early radio roles in the 1950s, through to her scatty antics on Absolutely Fabulous, she made more than 1,300 appearances on radio and TV.\n\nJune Rosemary Whitfield was born in Streatham, south London on 11 November 1925.\n\nHer father was a telephone company executive, her mother an amateur actress who pushed her young daughter into dramatics and dancing.\n\nImage caption By the mid 1950s she was one of radio's biggest stars\n\nTrained at Rada, to which she attributed her hard work ethic, Whitfield took her first professional acting job in 1944.\n\nShe was soon in demand on stage, radio and later television, and her long and varied career made for some surprising connections.\n\nWhen she appeared in the London production Ace of Clubs, she was befriended by the show's creator, Noel Coward, and spent weekends at his glamorous country home.\n\nLater she joined the chorus line of South Pacific, with its American lead Mary Martin, dating the star's young son, a pre-Dallas Larry Hagman.\n\nSecond billing\n\nHowever, her husband of 46 years, Tim Aitchison, was not from the same industry, but a chartered surveyor.\n\nWhitfield's ability to conjure up characters and superb sense of comic timing kept her in demand from across the entire canon of British comedy.\n\nStars such as Tony Hancock, Frankie Howerd, Ronnie Barker, Benny Hill, Bob Monkhouse and Tommy Cooper all clamoured to work with her.\n\nImage caption She was always the versatile sidekick\n\nShe called her autobiography ...and June Whitfield, in recognition of the fact that she always got second billing.\n\n\"The greatest of show business mysteries,\" Denis Norden once said, \"was how anyone could contemplate doing a comedy show without June Whitfield.\"\n\nWith Frankie Howerd, she recorded a version of the song Je T'aime, but even their spoof, complete with ironic heavy breathing, was considered too risque for the time and was famously banned by the BBC.\n\nHer most memorable radio role was in The Glums, Frank Muir and Denis Norden's spoof family soap, part of the popular show Take It From Here.\n\nChemistry\n\nFor seven years as the long-suffering Eth, her most oft-heard line was the lamenting \"Ooh, Ron\", addressed to her hapless fiance.\n\nAnd for two decades, she read the News Huddlines for her long-time friend and colleague Roy Hudd, in radio's longest-running audience comedy.\n\nHer first starring TV role came in the BBC sitcom Beggar My Neighbour in 1966.\n\nImage caption Terry and June: a gentle style of comedy\n\nShe went on to form her first working relationship with Terry Scott in Scott On..... before the pair teamed up again for Terry and June.\n\nThe chemistry between the unflappable Whitfield and her hare-brained husband was so solid that many viewers believed they were married in real life.\n\nDescribed as the apotheosis of undemanding, middle-class, primetime comedy, Terry and June attracted audiences of 15 million during its eight-year run.\n\nWhitfield described herself as living \"in the suburban corner, in real life and in the parts I've played. Very English, and nothing wrong with that\".\n\nUnlikely icon\n\nShe also became the face of a string of adverts for Birds Eye frozen ready meals with the punchline: \"It can make a dishonest woman of you.\"\n\nHer big screen appearances included four Carry On films, and, in 1996, the part of Aunt Drusilla in a film adaptation of Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure\n\n\"The Carry Ons were a nudging sort of humour, like seaside postcards,\" she said. \"Not at all politically correct, which was always a good thing.\"\n\nImage caption She played serious roles, here as Aunt Drusilla in Jude\n\nIn 1992, she became an unlikely icon to a new generation of fans with her portrayal of Edina's unworldly mother in the internationally successful Absolutely Fabulous.\n\nOriginally scheduled to appear in just one episode, she went on to become one of the show's most popular characters.\n\n\"As Joanna Lumley says, Ab Fab made us born-again actresses,\" she commented.\n\nAs the new century dawned, Whitfield continued a wide variety of roles including parts in Midsomer Murders and that retirement home for actors of a certain generation, Last of the Summer Wine.\n\nMuse\n\nIn 2009 she appeared in The End of Time, the Doctor Who episode that was the last for David Tennant.\n\nShe was awarded an OBE in 1985 and CBE in 1998 and, in 2017, became a Dame.\n\nDespite her success, Whitfield never wanted a lead role, explaining that she lacked the drive and confidence.\n\nImage caption She won a new generation of fans as the dotty mother in Absolutely Fabulous\n\nAnd as the on-stage muse to stars like Hancock and Cooper, she was all too aware of the personal cost.\n\nWhen they died prematurely, she attributed this to \"the responsibility, the stress and strain\" of carrying the show.\n\nInstead, June Whitfield revelled in her role of versatile sidekick for three generations of audiences.\n\nShe enjoyed enduring popularity and success, a life she described in her autobiography as \"full of love, affection and laughter, of gigs, gags and a couple of gongs\"."

    "text": "Dame June Whitfield was a constant presence in British post-war comedy.\n\nOften playing the female stooge to some of Britain's most famous entertainers, she called herself \"a comic's tart\".\n\nBut after six decades on radio and television, she established herself as a star in her own right.\n\nThe actress always said she was \"very bad at getting round to things\".\n\nBut from her early radio roles in the 1950s, through to her scatty antics on Absolutely Fabulous, she made more than 1,300 appearances on radio and TV.\n\nJune Rosemary Whitfield was born in Streatham, south London on 11 November 1925.\n\nHer father was a telephone company executive, her mother an amateur actress who pushed her young daughter into dramatics and dancing.\n\nImage caption By the mid 1950s she was one of radio's biggest stars\n\nTrained at Rada, to which she attributed her hard work ethic, Whitfield took her first professional acting job in 1944.\n\nShe was soon in demand on stage, radio and later television, and her long and varied career made for some surprising connections.\n\nWhen she appeared in the London production Ace of Clubs, she was befriended by the show's creator, Noel Coward, and spent weekends at his glamorous country home.\n\nLater she joined the chorus line of South Pacific, with its American lead Mary Martin, dating the star's young son, a pre-Dallas Larry Hagman.\n\nSecond billing\n\nHowever, her husband of 46 years, Tim Aitchison, was not from the same industry, but a chartered surveyor.\n\nWhitfield's ability to conjure up characters and superb sense of comic timing kept her in demand from across the entire canon of British comedy.\n\nStars such as Tony Hancock, Frankie Howerd, Ronnie Barker, Benny Hill, Bob Monkhouse and Tommy Cooper all clamoured to work with her.\n\nImage caption She was always the versatile sidekick\n\nShe called her autobiography ...and June Whitfield, in recognition of the fact that she always got second billing.\n\n\"The greatest of show business mysteries,\" Denis Norden once said, \"was how anyone could contemplate doing a comedy show without June Whitfield.\"\n\nWith Frankie Howerd, she recorded a version of the song Je T'aime, but even their spoof, complete with ironic heavy breathing, was considered too risque for the time and was famously banned by the BBC.\n\nHer most memorable radio role was in The Glums, Frank Muir and Denis Norden's spoof family soap, part of the popular show Take It From Here.\n\nChemistry\n\nFor seven years as the long-suffering Eth, her most oft-heard line was the lamenting \"Ooh, Ron\", addressed to her hapless fiance.\n\nAnd for two decades, she read the News Huddlines for her long-time friend and colleague Roy Hudd, in radio's longest-running audience comedy.\n\nHer first starring TV role came in the BBC sitcom Beggar My Neighbour in 1966.\n\nImage caption Terry and June: a gentle style of comedy\n\nShe went on to form her first working relationship with Terry Scott in Scott On..... before the pair teamed up again for Terry and June.\n\nThe chemistry between the unflappable Whitfield and her hare-brained husband was so solid that many viewers believed they were married in real life.\n\nDescribed as the apotheosis of undemanding, middle-class, primetime comedy, Terry and June attracted audiences of 15 million during its eight-year run.\n\nWhitfield described herself as living \"in the suburban corner, in real life and in the parts I've played. Very English, and nothing wrong with that\".\n\nUnlikely icon\n\nShe also became the face of a string of adverts for Birds Eye frozen ready meals with the punchline: \"It can make a dishonest woman of you.\"\n\nHer big screen appearances included four Carry On films, and, in 1996, the part of Aunt Drusilla in a film adaptation of Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure\n\n\"The Carry Ons were a nudging sort of humour, like seaside postcards,\" she said. \"Not at all politically correct, which was always a good thing.\"\n\nImage caption She played serious roles, here as Aunt Drusilla in Jude\n\nIn 1992, she became an unlikely icon to a new generation of fans with her portrayal of Edina's unworldly mother in the internationally successful Absolutely Fabulous.\n\nOriginally scheduled to appear in just one episode, she went on to become one of the show's most popular characters.\n\n\"As Joanna Lumley says, Ab Fab made us born-again actresses,\" she commented.\n\nAs the new century dawned, Whitfield continued a wide variety of roles including parts in Midsomer Murders and that retirement home for actors of a certain generation, Last of the Summer Wine.\n\nMuse\n\nIn 2009 she appeared in The End of Time, the Doctor Who episode that was the last for David Tennant.\n\nShe was awarded an OBE in 1985 and CBE in 1998 and, in 2017, became a Dame.\n\nDespite her success, Whitfield never wanted a lead role, explaining that she lacked the drive and confidence.\n\nImage caption She won a new generation of fans as the dotty mother in Absolutely Fabulous\n\nAnd as the on-stage muse to stars like Hancock and Cooper, she was all too aware of the personal cost.\n\nWhen they died prematurely, she attributed this to \"the responsibility, the stress and strain\" of carrying the show.\n\nInstead, June Whitfield revelled in her role of versatile sidekick for three generations of audiences.\n\nShe enjoyed enduring popularity and success, a life she described in her autobiography as \"full of love, affection and laughter, of gigs, gags and a couple of gongs\"."

At 92, she was made a dame.\n\nHer agent said she died peacefully on Friday night.\n\nTributes to her long and successful career in comedy are being made on Twitter.\n\nJulia Sawalha, who played her strait-laced granddaughter in Absolutely Fabulous, said Whitfield had been a \"great source of inspiration\" to her as a young actress but was \"far too humble to accept my adoration\".\n\nFellow Ab Fab actress Joanna Lumley told ITV news she was \"heartbroken to lose such a darling friend\", who would \"always have a most special place in my heart\".\n\nShe said she would never forget \"her sensational talent, humour and her generosity\".\n\nJane Horrocks, who played the ditzy character Bubble in the comedy, said her former co-star was a \"wonderful lady\", who was \"versatile, funny and generous\".\n\nMost of Whitfield's scenes during her three episodes on EastEnders were filmed opposite Jessie Wallace, who tweeted: \"A truly great actress and comedy legend. Working with June was a masterclass.\"\n\nImpressionist Rory Bremner called Whitfield the \"go-to comedy actress for three generations\".\n\nTV producer Jon Plowman, who worked on Absolutely Fabulous, said there was \"no-one with a better ability to just 'place' a line, always an act of utter precision\".\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 live he described working with Whitfield: \"You would hand her a script, she would work out where the laughs were and then would very quietly wipe the floor with everybody else.\"\n\nComedian Miranda Hart recalls a touching encounter with Whitfield who responded to an appeal for sponsorship for Edinburgh Festival early on in her career.\n\nAnd broadcaster Danny Baker said Whitfield was \"formidable, dependable, inimitable.

She was the go-to female comedy performer of her generation and was always in demand from the cream of British comedy.\"\n\nAmong those clamouring to work with her were Tony Hancock, Frankie Howerd, Ronnie Barker, Benny Hill, Bob Monkhouse and Tommy Cooper.\n\nOn Thursday, BBC Surrey broadcast what turned out to be her final interview, in which fellow showbusiness veteran David Hamilton visited Dame June at her home to talk about her life and career.\n\nObituary: A star in her own right\n\nImage caption Whitfield starred alongside Terry Scott in the hit 1970s sitcom\n\nDame June Whitfield was a constant presence in British post-war comedy.\n\nOften playing the female stooge to some of Britain's most famous entertainers, she called herself \"a comic's tart\".\n\nBut after six decades on radio and television, she established herself as a star in her own right.\n\nThe actress always said she was \"very bad at getting round to things\".\n\nBut from her early radio appearances in the 1950s, through to her scatty antics on Absolutely Fabulous, she featured in more than 1,300 radio and television shows."

    "text": "Ghibliotheque\n\nGhibliotheque\u2019s tagline is simply: a podcast about Studio Ghibli, and it does very much what it says on the tin. Hosted by Michael Leader and Jake Cunningham, each episode takes on one of the Japanese animation giant\u2019s films. Before the podcast started, Cunningham had never seen a Ghibli film and is being guided by Leader, a self-confessed Ghibli fanatic. At about half-an-hour long, each episode is the perfect length to dive into each film, while remaining accessible to the passing listener. Leader and Cunningham draw the audience into the magical world of Ghibli, linking each film with the history of the animation studio and the wider context of Japanese cinema. Leader\u2019s knowledge of Ghibli and his excitement to share it is infectious and Cunningham makes a great companion to learn with. But beware, spoilers lie within!\n\nStarter episode: My Neighbour Totoro (with Beth Webb) | Ghibliotheque #3\n\nMostly Lit\n\nA refreshing change of pace when it comes to book chat \u2013 Mostly Lit, which began in 2016, is a fun and upbeat listen, hosted by three young people who have an unabashed love for literature. Alex Reads, Raifa Rafiq and Derek Owusu are vibrant and funny, injecting their personality and enthusiasm into discussions. But above all, they cleverly analyse books in an accessible format \u2013 taking books like The Great Gatsby off their academic and exclusive peg. Mostly Lit feels like an impassioned discussion between friends, with the hosts challenging each other in the way that only friends can. Every episode includes the three hosts talking about what they\u2019ve been reading over the past week, and often includes discussions about the millennial experience, pop culture, film and book news.\n\nStarter episode: The Many Faces of Jay Gatsby\n\nEverything is Alive\n\nEverything is Alive is a podcast that absolutely shouldn\u2019t work. But, somehow, it does. The premise is simple: in every episode creator and host Ian Chillag interviews an everyday, inanimate object, played by an unscripted actor. The first episode is an interview with Louis, a can of own-brand supermarket cola. It takes you on a journey through Louis\u2019s life, to where he sits in the fridge now, going on to discuss the idea of serving his purpose in the world (to be drunk), ultimately discussing death and how it feels to die. Macabre it may seem, but this and the subsequent episodes are poignant, touching and at times laugh-out-loud funny examinations of the human condition. Other episodes include an interview with a tooth, a lamppost and a grain of sand, each touching on the basic things that make us who we are. Prepare to think deeply about yourself, to laugh and at times, cry.\n\nStarter episode: Chioke, Grain of Sand\n\nAudio Poem of the Day\n\nFrom the Poetry Foundation, this is a daily dose of poetry, delivered by the some of the best-placed people to do it. Each day, classic and contemporary poems are read aloud by actors or the poets themselves and delivered to wherever you listen to podcasts. Perfect for when you may need a quiet moment, or just a distraction from modern life. The poems are simply presented, with no jingles or background music \u2013 just the voice and the words. Try listening to one or two before bed.\n\nStarter episode: Ulysses\n\nThe Lonely Palette\n\nEach episode of The Lonely Palette is dedicated to unpacking one piece of art. Host Tamar Avishai starts by interviewing museum guests about what they\u2019re looking at, asking them to describe what they see and what they think it means. Avishai then dives into the history of the work, including the artist\u2019s influences and inspirations. It\u2019s a charming and clever introduction into art history, a topic that can feel too wide and intimidating for many. It also succeeds in introducing what is essentially an entirely visual medium (a painting or sculpture), in an entirely non-visual format (audio). Avishai tells stories with enthusiasm for the subject, and makes art history accessible.\n\nStarter episode: Ren\u00e9 Magritte\u2019s The Son of Man (1964)\n\nAwaye!\n\nAboriginal arts and culture is in the spotlight for this Australian podcast from ABC Radio National, which is presented by smooth-voiced broadcaster Daniel Browning. While it focuses on the Australian Aboriginal experience, Awaye! also has interviews with, and documentaries about indigenous people \u2013 and their arts and culture \u2013 from around the world. A thoughtful podcast, Awaye!\u2019s interviews successfully combine the critical arts interview with in-depth discussions about race and society. Aboriginal languages are also highlighted in the weekly feature Word Up, where a guest speaker picks three words from their language to share with the listener, highlighting the importance of those words to their culture. It\u2019s a fascinating listen, which brings forth much which is otherwise underrepresented in mainstream cultural discourse.\n\nStarter episode: Saturday 8 December 2018\n\n99% Invisible: Articles of Interest\n\nA veritable behemoth of the podcasting world, 99% Invisible this year broadcast a six-part series on the history of clothing. The fascinating tour of humans\u2019 sartorial choices starts in the kids\u2019 department. The following five episodes include the history of pockets (it\u2019s more interesting than it sounds), Hawaiian shirts and punk. Articles of Interest, led by Avery Trufelman, feeds the listener\u2019s curiosity in the everyday and its fascinating hidden corners. The episodes are carefully crafted so that the links between them feel natural, not shoehorned in as an afterthought.\n\nStarter episode: Kids clothes: Articles of Interest #1\n\nPop Culture Happy Hour\n\nFrom the radio and podcasting giants at NPR, Pop Culture Happy Hour is a joyous celebration of popular culture that dives into the latest movies and TV shows (and occasionally books). Enthusiastically presented, it\u2019s chock-full of thoughtful and intelligent criticism. Episodes are short and stand alone, each with a singular topic. This means you can dip in and out. Above all, it\u2019s fun while being informative.\n\nStarter episode: Widows Is Not Your Everyday Heist Flick\n\nDreamgun Film Reads\n\nOn Dreamgun Film Reads, a comedy four-piece from Dublin, Ireland, take a well-known film script (Harry Potter, Jurassic Park, Titanic) and turn it on its head in front of a live audience. The new story follows the same plot line, but is stuffed with lewd innuendos and surreal moments. The scripts are re-written by Stephen Colfer, Gavin Drea, Heber Hanly and James McDonnell, then given to actors and comedians to perform on stage in front of the audience, who haven\u2019t been given the chance to read it in advance. The combination of a recognisable story and the total lack of rehearsal makes the result even funnier; the gaffes, absurd moments and palpable joy from the cast makes the podcast a delightful, laugh-out-loud listen. Winner of Best Ensemble at Dublin Fringe Festival Awards 2018, season two of the podcast begins in January 2019.\n\nStarter episode: Titanic\n\nLiterary Friction\n\nRunning for five years, Literary Friction is a monthly podcast hosted by Carrie Plitt and Octavia Bright. The friends \u2013 one from the US, one from the UK \u2013 interview authors about their lives, work and inspirations, as well as discussing wider literary topics and giving out book recommendations. Literary Friction is a thoughtful podcast, which requires active listening (don\u2019t make the mistake I did of trying to listen to a discussion about historical fiction in the supermarket). Plitt and Bright ask intelligent and probing questions, but the overall feeling is of inclusivity rather than elitism. You will discover great things to read and feel smarter after you\u2019ve listened to this.\n\nStarter episode: History with Esi Edugyan\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Image copyright PA\n\nThe 5p fee for plastic carrier bags in England will be doubled to 10p, and extended to all shops, under plans set out by the environment secretary.\n\nThe change is contained in a government consultation aimed at further reducing the plastic used by consumers and could come into effect in January 2020.\n\nSmaller retailers, who are exempt from the current levy, supply an estimated 3.6 billion single-use bags annually.\n\nSchools in England are also being told to eliminate unnecessary plastic.\n\nEducation Secretary Damian Hinds is urging school leaders to replace items such as plastic straws, bottles and food packaging with sustainable alternatives by 2022.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Five ways to break up with plastic\n\nIn August, Theresa May promised there would be a consultation on changes to the plastic bag levy.\n\nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove said: \"We want to do even more to protect our precious planet and today's announcement will accelerate further behaviour change and build on the success of the existing charge.\"\n\nSince the 5p fee was introduced in 2015 for retailers with at least 250 employees, an estimated 15 billion bags have been taken out of circulation.\n\nTrade bodies representing about 40,000 small retailers have launched a voluntary approach to a 5p charge, but this accounts for less than one-fifth of companies likely to be affected by the proposed changes.\n\nAnalysis\n\nby Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst\n\nThe government wavered for years before imposing a plastic bag tax for England - but the result of the policy eventually introduced is crystal clear: taxes change behaviour.\n\nPeople who previously thought nothing of carting home their supermarket shopping in half a dozen flimsy plastic bags seem appalled by the prospect of a 30p charge, and dig into their handbags for nylon bags instead.\n\nA similar shift in behaviour will surely be seen now in local stores, although the change may be less marked because people tend to buy smaller quantities from corner shops, so may be willing to pay an extra 10p for convenience.\n\nIt's also possible that these convenience store bags disproportionately harm the environment because they're used by people picking up snacks while visiting beauty spots or beaches.\n\nThe announcement of a consultation on an increased charge is part of a broader move towards environmental taxation - an issue which can easily cause governments trouble if they don't protect the poorest from the impact of the taxes.\n\nIn Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, all retailers - including smaller shops - already charge a minimum of 5p for plastic bags.\n\nThe Marine Conservation Society says the levies have had an impact on reducing plastic waste on beaches and in the sea.\n\nOceanographer Laura Foster, head of Clean Seas at the MCS, said: \"We are able to measure the impact of legislation and we've seen that since the introduction of the plastic bag charge in the UK the amount we find on the beaches has gone down.\n\n\"That's also been replicated by studies that have been done offshore. They've also seen a reduction in the amount of plastic bags they find.\"\n\nWhile retailers are given the choice on what to do with the money consumers pay for plastic bags, they are expected to give it to good causes. According to Defra, an estimated \u00a351m was donated in 2017-18.\n\nThe Association of Convenience Stores, which is backing Defra's plans, says about half of the small shops it represents in England are currently charging for plastic bags.\n\nACS chief executive James Lowman said: \"This has been shown to be highly effective at reducing waste, whilst also raising money for local, national and environmental charities.\""

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There are normally around 105 male births for every 100 female ones\n\nEvery year, there are always more baby boys than girls born in England and Wales. Fact. Why?\n\nSince records began in 1838, the cries of babies born every year have been predominately male.\n\nIn not one year, stretching back to the start of Queen Victoria's reign, have girls outnumbered boys at birth.\n\nIn 2017, in England and Wales, for example, there were 348,071 live male births and 331,035 live female births - a difference of roughly 17,000.\n\nAnd that higher tally of males compared to females born each year is a pattern that has repeated itself for nearly 180 years.\n\nIn fact, a ratio of roughly 105 male births for every 100 female ones is generally seen as natural and normal.\n\nIt is fairly consistent around the world, although in some countries like China and India the gap is wider because male offspring are more desirable.\n\nMore surprisingly, it is a ratio that has been known about since the 17th Century.\n\nBut why this ratio exists is not yet completely understood - although there are several theories.\n\nIt's all about evolution\n\nThe first theory is an evolutionary one which says that in order to have an equal number of males and female in adulthood, there have to be slightly more males born.\n\nThat is because being a male is a dangerous thing. Males are more likely than females to die in childhood and at all stages of life - from accidents, taking risks, suicide and from health problems.\n\n\"At every age, in almost every time and place, a man is more likely to die than a woman,\" says Prof David Steinsaltz, associate professor of statistics at the University of Oxford.\n\nSo more males than females at the start of life should mean equal numbers of men and women in adulthood, so the theory goes.\n\nIn fact, adult women always end up slightly outnumbering adult men in the UK, according to Office for National Statistics figures - and living longer.\n\nSperm and timing\n\nThere are lots of different factors that could determine whether a male sperm (carrying a Y chromosome) or a female sperm (carrying an X chromosome) is first in the race to fertilise the woman's egg.\n\nThese include the ages of the parents, the woman's ovulation cycle, levels of stress, diet and sexual position.\n\nOne popular theory is that the odds of having a girl increase by having sex several days before ovulation and then abstaining so that the female sperm, which live longer, but swim more slowly than male sperm, outlast their counterparts.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Male sperm are the best swimmers but female sperm live longer\n\nConversely, if sex happens closer to ovulation or after it, the best swimmers get to the egg first and boys are produced.\n\nParents may swear by these techniques, but scientists say there is little evidence they make any difference.\n\nThere is also some research which suggests parental stress could lead to the birth of more girls, while living through wars and conflicts may give rise to more male conceptions.\n\nSurvival in the womb\n\nIf planning that sexual encounter does not have an impact on a baby's sex, then could something else be happening during pregnancy?\n\nIf there are equal numbers of female and male-producing sperm and roughly equal numbers of conceptions, then more female foetuses must perish to give males the upper hand.\n\nSome research suggests females are more likely to be lost in the womb during early pregnancy, but other studies have shown males foetuses are more fragile later in pregnancy and lead to more stillbirths.\n\nScientists say it is hard to pin down what actually happens and the reasons why.\n\nWhat we do know is that more male conceptions reach term and more boys are born."

If you don't drink, for health or addiction reasons, then imagine how hard it is to be pressured into drinking,\" says the Call the Midwife actor.\n\nMcGann, who is 55, gave up alcohol 18 years ago after training for a charity trek. \"I grew up in the North in that beer culture, where you would sit in the pub and get a bladder-full. Now I don't get hangovers and I enjoy being the designated driver.\n\n\"One friend really got wound up by me not drinking. Am not sure he's ever got over it. Now I get bloody-minded and indignant if people try to push a drink on me. Booze is so deeply ingrained in our culture. Recently I was at a do where a waiter put a glass of wine in my hand before I'd even said hello. Imagine if I was a recovering alcoholic? People would never try to get a vegetarian to eat meat.\"\n\n'As soon as the British get the off switch, they drink'\n\nAuthor Matt Haig, 43, who has written about his struggles with depression in his bestselling book, Reasons to Stay Alive, describes himself as a part-time teetotaller.\n\nImage copyright Matt Haig Image caption Author Matt Haig says he avoids events where he will feel under pressure to drink\n\n\"I love drinking, but if I drink too much then it can trigger anxiety and then depression, so I have massive patches of not drinking. Sometimes it's just easier not to go out, as I get too tempted.\n\n\"Even if others don't pressurise me, you feel a silent pressure. It's a bit like being a vegan, it gets other people's backs up because they feel guilty or judged.\"\n\nHaig notes British society's obsession with drinking. \"As soon as we get that off switch we drink. Go to Gatwick and you'll see people drinking at 08:00. It's changing, young people are drinking less, but I'll never be that Mediterranean person who can have one glass of wine.\"\n\nHis tips for being a non-drinker include ordering a virgin Bloody Mary, \"it feels hedonistic\", going to a restaurant rather than a bar or pub, doing exercise to replace that space where you \"let off steam\", and saying to those who try to foist drinks on you: \"I don't drink.\"\n\n\"People think there must be a reason and don't question it. It's about not feeling guilty, and not doing things out of obligation. The trouble with being a man is that we literally can't think of anywhere to meet that isn't a pub.\"\n\n'I tell them I'm a loose cannon if I drink'\n\nImage copyright Catherine Gray Image caption Catherine Gray used to be a \"drink pusher\" until she gave up alcohol\n\nCatherine Gray, author of The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober Journal, recalls how when she used to drink she was one of the \"meanest drink pushers\".\n\n\"If somebody wasn't drinking I didn't want them there. But it was to do with my issues rather than them. It's the heaviest drinkers who call you no fun. They want an accomplice.\"\n\nGray, 38, gave up alcohol five years ago. \"I couldn't moderate. But then I hardly know anyone who can moderate, it's hard.\"\n\nNow when people try to encourage her to drink she makes a joke of it. \"Nobody wants to hear you go on about the health risks. I tell them I'm a loose cannon. I make a joke out of it. Never be apologetic, people will leap on that.\"\n\n'Social loneliness'\n\nYet despite the fact that alcohol is deeply embedded in our social lives, the culture is changing. Recent figures from a study by the University of London showed that almost a third of young people don't drink at all.\n\nEven so, young people, particularly those with mental health issues, still struggle with alcohol.\n\nJennifer Griffin, psychotherapist and general manager of Turn2me - an online charitable mental health website for young people, says many of those they help find social occasions that revolve around drinking difficult.\n\n\"Alcohol is linked to anxiety and depression. Yet socialising is how young people develop a connection to their peers. If they choose not to socialise because they will be exposed to alcohol, then they might alienate themselves and suffer from loneliness.\n\n\"The [buying a] round system is also an issue, it's lovely and generous, but it's difficult to resist.\"\n\nGriffin suggests working out a strategy in advance, and prioritising your own needs.\n\nAs awareness of the health risks grow, not drinking, or cutting back on drinking, is becoming increasingly common. Everyone is in agreement. If someone says no to a drink, don't ask twice.\n\nFollow Laurel Ives on Twitter"

    "text": "This story is featured in BBC Future\u2019s \u201cBest of 2018\u201d collection. Discover more of our picks.\n\n\n\nIt was the summer of 1860 and Eadweard Muybridge was running low on books. This was somewhat problematic, since he was a bookseller. He handed his San Francisco shop over to his brother and set off on a stagecoach to buy supplies. Little did he know, he was about to change the world forever.\n\nHe was some way into his journey, in north-eastern Texas, when the coach ran into trouble. The driver cracked his whip and the horses broke into a run, leading the coach surging down a steep mountain road. Eventually it veered off and into a tree. Muybridge was catapulted into the air and cracked his head on a boulder.\n\nHe woke up nine days later at a hospital 150 miles (241 km) away. The accident left him with a panoply of medical problems, including double vision, bouts of seizures and no sense of smell, hearing or taste. But the most radical change was his personality.\n\nPreviously Muybridge had been a genial and open man, with good business sense. Afterwards he was risk-taking, eccentric and moody; he later murdered his wife\u2019s lover. He was also, quite possibly, a genius.\n\nThe question of where creative insights come from \u2013 and how to get more of them \u2013 has remained a subject of great speculation for thousands of years. According to scientists, they can be driven by anything from fatigue to boredom. The prodigies themselves have other, even less convincing ideas. Plato said that they were the result of divine madness. Or do they, as Freud believed, arise from the sublimation of sexual desires? Tchaikovsky maintained that eureka moments are born out of cool headwork and technical knowledge.\n\nBut until recently, most sensible people agreed on one thing: creativity begins in the pink, wobbly mass inside our skulls. It surely goes without saying that striking the brain, impaling it, electrocuting it, shooting it, slicing bits out of it or depriving it of oxygen would lead to the swift death of any great visions possessed by its owner.\n\nAs it happens, sometimes the opposite is true.\n\nAfter the accident, Muybridge eventually recovered enough to sail to England. There his creativity really took hold. He abandoned bookselling and became a photographer, one of the most famous in the world. He was also a prolific inventor. Before the accident, he hadn\u2019t filed a single patent. In the following two decades, he applied for at least 10.\n\nIn 1877 he took a bet that allowed him to combine invention and photography. Legend has it that his friend, a wealthy railroad tycoon called Leland Stanford, was convinced that horses could fly. Or, more accurately, he was convinced that when they run, all their legs leave the ground at the same time. Muybridge said they didn\u2019t.\n\nTo prove it he placed 12 cameras along a horse track and installed a tripwire that would set them off automatically as Stanford\u2019s favourite racing horse, Occident, ran. Next he invented the inelegantly named \u201czoopraxiscope\u201d, a device which allowed him to project several images in quick succession and give the impression of motion. To his amazement, the horse was briefly suspended, mid-gallop. Muybridge had filmed the first movie \u2013 and with it proven that yes, horses can fly.\n\nJon Sarkin was transformed from a chiropractor into an artist after a stroke\n\nThe abrupt turnaround of Muybridge\u2019s life, from ordinary bookseller to creative genius, has prompted speculation that it was a direct result of his accident. It\u2019s possible that he had \u201csudden savant syndrome\u201d, in which exceptional abilities emerge after a brain injury or disease. It\u2019s extremely rare, with just 25 verified cases on the planet.\n\nThere\u2019s Tony Cicoria, an orthopaedic surgeon who was struck by lightning at a New York park in 1994. It went straight through his head and left him with an irresistible desire to play the piano. To begin with he was playing other people\u2019s music, but soon he started writing down the melodies that were constantly running through his head. Today he\u2019s a pianist and composer, as well as a practicing surgeon.\n\nAnother case is Jon Sarkin, who was transformed from a chiropractor into an artist after a stroke. The urge to draw landed almost immediately. He was having \u201call kinds\u201d of therapy at the hospital \u2013 speech therapy, art therapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, mental therapy \u2013 \u201cAnd they stuck a crayon in my hand and said \u2018want to draw?\u2019 And I said \u2018fine\u2019,\u201d he says.\n\nHis first muse was a cactus at his home in Gloucester, Massachusetts. It was the fingered kind, like you might find in Western movies from the 50s. Even his earliest paintings are extremely abstract. In some versions the branches resemble swirling green snakes, while others they are red, zig-zagging staircases.\n\nHis works have since been published in The New York Times, featured on album covers and been covered in a book by a Pulitzer Prize-winning author. They regularly sell for $10,000 (\u00a37,400).\n\nMost strikingly there\u2019s Jason Padgett, who was attacked at a bar in Tacoma, Washington in 2002. Before the attack, Padgett was a college dropout who worked at a futon store. His primary passions in life were partying and chasing girls. He had no interest in maths \u2013 at school, he didn\u2019t even get into algebra class.\n\nBut that night, everything changed. Initially he was taken to the hospital with a severe concussion. \u201cI remember thinking that everything looked funky, but I thought it was just the narcotic pain shot they gave me\u201d he says. \u201cThen the next morning I woke up and turned on the water. It looked like little tangent lines [a straight line that touches a single point on a curve], spiralling down.\u201d.\n\nWhen you\u2019re bashed on the head, the effects are similar to a dose of LSD\n\nFrom then onwards Padgett\u2019s world was overlaid with geometric shapes and gridlines. He became obsessed with maths and is now renowned for his drawings of formulas such as Pi. Today he\u2019s incredulous that he once didn\u2019t know what a tangent was. \u201cI do feel like two people, and I\u2019ve had my mum and my dad say that. It\u2019s like having two separate kids,\u201d he says.\n\nWhy does this happen? How does it work? And what does it teach us about what makes geniuses special?\n\nThere are two leading ideas. The first is that when you\u2019re bashed on the head, the effects are similar to a dose of LSD. Psychedelic drugs are thought to enhance creativity by increasing the levels of serotonin, the so-called \u201chappiness hormone\u201d, in the brain. This leads to \u201csynaesthesia\u201d, in which more than one region is simultaneously activated and senses which are usually separate become linked.\n\nMany people don\u2019t need drugs to experience this: nearly 5% of the population has some form of synaesthesia, with the most common type being \u201cgrapheme-colour\u201d, in which words are associated with colours. For example, the actor Geoffrey Rush believes that Mondays are pale blue.\n\nWhen the brain is injured, dead and dying cells leak serotonin into the surrounding tissue. Physically, this seems to encourage new connections between brain regions, just as with LSD. Mentally, it allows the person to link the seemingly unconnected. \u201cWe\u2019ve found permanent changes before \u2013 you can actually see connections in the brain that weren\u2019t there before,\u201d says Berit Brogaard, a neuroscientist who directs the Brogaard Lab for Multisensory Research, Florida.\n\nBut there is an alternative. The first clue emerged in 1998, when a group of neurologists noticed that five of their patients with dementia were also artists \u2013 remarkably good ones. Specifically, they had frontotemporal dementia, which is unusual in that it only affects some parts of the brain. For example, visual creativity may be spared, while language and social skills are progressively destroyed.\n\nOne of these was \u201cPatient 5\u201d. At the age of 53 he had enrolled in a short course in drawing at a local park, though he previously had no interest in such things. It just so happened to coincide with the onset of his dementia; a few months later, he was having trouble speaking.\n\nSoon he became irritable and eccentric, developing a compulsion to search for money on the street. As his illness progressed, so did his drawing, advancing from simple still-life paintings to haunting, impressionist depictions of buildings from his childhood.\n\nTo find out what was going on, the scientists performed 3D scans of their patients\u2019 brains. In four out of five cases, they found lesions on the left hemisphere. Nobel Prize-winning research from the 1960s shows that the two halves of the brain specialise in different tasks; in general, the right side is home to creativity and the left is the centre of logic and language.\n\n\u2018Autistic savants\u2019 can have superhuman skills to rival those of the Renaissance polymaths\n\nBut the left side is also something of a bully. \u201cIt tends to be the dominant brain region,\u201d says Brogaard. \u201cIt tends to suppress very marginal types of thinking - highly original, highly creative thinking, because it\u2019s beneficial for our decision-making abilities and our ability to function in normal life.\u201d. The theory goes that as the patients\u2019 left hemispheres became progressively more damaged, their right hemispheres were free to flourish.\n\nThis is backed up by several other studies, including one in which creative insight was roused in healthy volunteers by temporarily dialling down activity in the left hemisphere and increasing it in the right. \u201c[the lead researcher] Allen Snyder\u2019s work was replicated by another person, so that\u2019s the theory that I think is responsible,\u201d says Darold Treffert, a psychiatrist from the University of Wisconsin Medical School, who has been studying savant syndrome for decades.\n\nBut what about more mainstream geniuses? Could the theory explain their talents, too?\n\nConsider autism. From Daniel Tammet, who can perform mind-boggling mathematical calculations at stupendous speed, to Gottfried Mind, the \u201cCat Raphael\u201d, who drew the animal with an astonishing level of realism, so-called \u201cautistic savants\u201d can have superhuman skills to rival those of the Renaissance polymaths.\n\nIt\u2019s been estimated that as many as one in 10 people with autism have savant syndrome and there\u2019s mounting evidence the disorder is associated with enhanced creativity. And though it\u2019s difficult to prove, it\u2019s been speculated that numerous intellectual giants, including Einstein, Newton, Mozart, Darwin and Michelangelo, were on the spectrum.\n\nOne theory suggests that autism arises from abnormally low levels of serotonin in the left hemisphere in childhood, which prevents the region from developing normally. Just like with sudden savant syndrome, this allows the right hemisphere to become more active.\n\nThey are usually able to have a normal life, but they also have this obsession - Berit Brogaard, neuroscientist\n\nInterestingly, many people with sudden savant syndrome also develop symptoms of autism, including social problems, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and all-consuming interests. \u201cIt got so bad that if I had money I would spray the money with Lysol and put it in the microwave for a few seconds to get rid of the germs,\u201d says Padgett.\n\n\u201cThey are usually able to have a normal life, but they also have this obsession,\u201d says Brogaard. This is something universal across all sudden savants. Jon Sarkin compares his art to an instinct. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like I like drawing, it feels like I must draw.\u201d His studio contains thousands of finished and unfinished works, which are often scribbled with curves, words, cross-hatchings, and overlapping images.\n\nIn fact, though they often don\u2019t need to, sudden savants work hard at improving their craft. \u201cI mean, I practiced a lot. Talent and hard work, I think they are indistinguishable \u2013 you do something a lot and you get better at it,\u201d says Sarkin. Padgett agrees. \u201cWhen you\u2019re fixated on something like that, of course you do discover things.\u201d\n\nMuybridge was no exception. After the bet, he moved to Philadelphia and continued with his passion for capturing motion on film, photographing all kinds of activities such as walking up and down the stairs and, oddly, himself swinging a pickaxe in the nude. Between 1883 and 1886, he took more than 100,000 pictures.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion at least, the fact that they can improve their abilities doesn\u2019t negate the suddenness or insistence with which they are there,\u201d says Treffert. As our understanding of sudden savant syndrome improves, eventually it\u2019s hoped that we might all be able to unlock our hidden mental powers \u2013 perhaps with the help of smart drugs or hardware.\n\nBut until then, perhaps us mortals could try putting in some extra hours instead.\n\n--\n\nJoin 800,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "text": "As 2018 comes to an end, everyone will reflect on an eventful year during which England won a World Cup penalty shootout, Liverpool lost one of the most incident-packed Champions League finals ever, and Manchester City won the title in record-breaking style.\n\nBut what do we have to look forward to in 2019?\n\nThe most exciting Premier League title race in years\n\nManchester City and Liverpool drew 0-0 at Anfield in October - but how will their January meeting go?\n\nManchester City's sky-blue ribbons were already being tied to the Premier League trophy this time last year as Pep Guardiola's side established a 14-point lead after only 18 games. The race to the tape was a formality.\n\nNot this year.\n\nThis is shaping up as the most exciting season in years as Liverpool match, and indeed lead, City while Spurs and Chelsea, albeit in a more understated manner, make claims of their own.\n\nThe excitement and anticipation surrounding this season can be illustrated in managers, players and supporters already weighing up the potential long-term damage of dropped points well before the turn of the year.\n\nThe season is made even more exciting by the thrilling brand of football on offer from the teams chasing the big prize - from Guardiola's City to Jurgen Klopp's vibrant, attacking Liverpool side. Tottenham's Mauricio Pochettino and newcomer Maurizio Sarri at Chelsea are also determined to pursue trophies in the most attractive manner, while the animated Unai Emery has been a breath of fresh air at Arsenal.\n\nAnd while life on the field has been dull at Manchester United, a familiar acrimonious decline into another pre-Christmas dismissal for Jose Mourinho has given Ole Gunnar Solskjaer the chance to illuminate the 'Theatre Of Dreams' once more.\n\nThe Premier League has seen dramatic finishes in recent seasons, such as when Manchester City pipped Manchester United on goal difference in 2011-12, and when Liverpool stumbled at the finishing line to lose out to City two years later. This season could be just as dramatic.\n\nCity won the title by 19 points from Manchester United last season and had a goal difference 33 ahead of their closest rivals in that department - Liverpool. It was a procession - but this could go to the wire.\n\nCity's surprise defeat at home to Crystal Palace just before Christmas - after Liverpool had beaten Wolves the day before - means Guardiola's men are in the unusual position of playing catch-up, with four points separating the top two.\n\nOne of the most vital acts in the drama will be played out when City and Liverpool face each other at Etihad Stadium on 3 January.\n\nThe Women's World Cup\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Phil Neville excited by 'mouth-watering' tie as England draw Scotland\n\nThe ever-expanding global women's game gets its greatest showcase once more in France next summer - and expectations have never been higher as its profile continues to rise.\n\nThe draw has only added to the anticipation as England, managed by Phil Neville, face Scotland, guided by head coach Shelley Kerr, in their opening game in Nice on 9 June.\n\nArgentina and Japan make up England and Scotland's group.\n\nThe Lionesses are making their fifth World Cup appearance and will be hoping to improve on their 2015 performance, when they lost 2-1 to Japan in the semi-final.\n\nEngland are fourth in the world rankings behind the United States, Germany and France, with Scotland 20th.\n\nAnd the SheBelieves Cup, in which England will face Brazil, the United States and Japan in late February and early March, will provide an intriguing measure of their progress under Neville.\n\nThe final of the Women's World Cup will be staged in the Stade de Lyon on 7 July.\n\nA Scottish Premiership thriller?\n\nSteven Gerrard's Rangers are playing their part in the first proper Scottish title race in years\n\nCeltic have been conducting a procession to the Scottish Premiership title for the past seven seasons - but it is all looking a lot tighter north of the border this season to set up a potentially thrilling 2019.\n\nA combination of ingredients are in the mix to make this a potent cocktail and allow Scotland to throw back some insults at the English about one-sided title races - especially after Manchester City's stroll to the title last term.\n\nThe gap is no longer wider than the Clyde estuary.\n\nSteven Gerrard's arrival at Rangers was always going to add spice and it has not only raised sunken hopes at Ibrox but also coincided with a perhaps inevitable dip in the standards of a Celtic side that has carried all before them in manager Brendan Rodgers' first two seasons.\n\nIt would, however, be patronising to simply focus on the Old Firm. Scottish football is offering much more.\n\nCeltic, Rangers, Hearts and Kilmarnock have all been top of the table this season - with Steve Clarke's work at Killie an outstanding piece of management.\n\nAberdeen and Hibernian have also produced evidence of the ability to challenge and overcome the supposed natural order, and the first Ibrox meeting between Gerrard and his former Liverpool manager on 29 December is heavily loaded with significance.\n\nIt is shaping up to be a 2019 to relish in Scotland.\n\nCan England bring home the Uefa Nations League?\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device World Cup 2018: England's historic penalty shootout win against Colombia in full\n\nEngland capitalised on reaching their first World Cup semi-final for 28 years by reaching the finals of the inaugural Uefa Nations League with their first win in Spain for 31 years, and by exacting revenge on Croatia with a dramatic late 2-1 win at Wembley.\n\nIt built on the feel-good factor engendered in Russia, maintained momentum and increased the belief manager Gareth Southgate has a squad offering real optimism for the future.\n\nNow they have a great chance to turn potential into something tangible in Portugal next June.\n\nEngland face Ronald Koeman's rejuvenated Netherlands in the semi-final, and Portugal play Switzerland in the other last-four game.\n\nNo-one should kid themselves winning this would end the so-called \"years of hurt\" since the 1966 World Cup, as this tournament - which has been a surprise success and added a new dimension to the international scene - is very much in its infancy and way behind the majors like the World Cup and the Euros.\n\nBut success breeds success and it would be a sign of England's progress and development under Southgate should they be able to win silverware as they re-establish themselves as a serious power in the game.\n\nEngland's Under-21s will also be hoping to add to the success of the under-17s and under-20s World Cup winners when they take part in the Euros in Italy and San Marino in June.\n\nThis is another tournament that is growing in stature each time, and Aidy Boothroyd's side will have high hopes with talent such as Manchester City's Phil Foden, Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho, and Mason Mount - the Chelsea youngster on loan at Derby County - to potentially call on.\n\nThey will face France, Romania and Croatia in their group games and, like England's seniors, will hope to improve on a bitter semi-final disappointment after losing on penalties to Germany in Tychy, Poland.\n\nThis is an exciting time for England at all levels, and 2019 might just provide further evidence of how bright the future might be.\n\nAnother Championship fight to the finish?\n\nCould this finally be Leeds' season under Argentine wildcard Marcelo Bielsa?\n\nIs there any division more difficult to get out of than the Championship?\n\nSome of England's greatest clubs have dropped out of the Premier League then found the return journey so competitive it proves impossible.\n\nIf proof is needed, just look at those jockeying for position at the top of the table.\n\nLeeds United, under the guidance of the maverick but wonderfully innovative Marcelo Bielsa, have played some stunning football as they attempt to reclaim the place at the top table which has not been theirs since 2004, while Norwich City have been outstanding under Daniel Farke.\n\nAnd that is just the start.\n\nWest Bromwich Albion have set their sights on instant promotion under Darren Moore while Derby County are making strides as Frank Lampard settles into his first managerial job.\n\nChris Wilder is proving once more what an outstanding operator he is at his beloved Sheffield United while Middlesbrough's Tony Pulis - not everyone's cup of tea - has successfully navigated the Championship's course and distance before.\n\nAnd are things stirring at Aston Villa now boyhood fan Dean Smith has succeeded Steve Bruce?\n\nThis is the division that produces tension and excitement every year because the price of success is so great and the price of failure can be so expensive.\n\nExpect no different in 2019."

    "text": "The year 2018 provided plenty to chew on if you're interested in science and the environment. From the stark warning from climate scientists about the dangers of letting temperatures rise beyond 1.5C to the discovery of a 20km-wide liquid water lake on Mars, it was a memorable year.\n\nHere's a rundown of some of 2018's most eye-catching stories.\n\nA \"safe\" limit for warming\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nA rise in global temperatures of 2C by the end of this century has long been seen as the gateway to dangerous climate change. Researchers had argued that keeping within this limit was necessary to avoid the most damaging effects of global warming.\n\nBut some have been pushing for an even lower target of 1.5C. In October, climate scientists released a major report detailing what would be involved in keeping the temperature rise to within that tougher limit.\n\nThis would result in millions fewer people losing their homes to rising seas, fewer species at risk of extinction and a drastic reduction in the numbers of people experiencing water scarcity.\n\nBut it would also be hugely expensive and require \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes\" to society. The report didn't tell governments what to do, but set out a range of approaches including heavy cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, a rapid transition to renewable energy and lifestyle and dietary changes.\n\nOther climate change stories from 2018\n\nClimate change 'greatest threat', UN told\n\nLast four years are 'world's hottest'\n\nClimate change: Where we are in seven charts\n\nThe earliest animals\n\nImage copyright ANU\n\nThe one-million-plus animal species alive today are staggeringly diverse, from the giant oceanic blue whale to the wriggly earthworms beneath our feet. But their early evolution from single-celled ancestors remains shrouded in mystery.\n\nIn the hunt for the earliest animal life, much attention has been focused on a group of enigmatic life forms - known as the \"Ediacaran biota\" - from more than 500 million years ago. These were some of the first complex organisms to appear on Earth.\n\nBut their position on the tree of life is difficult decipher. These curious creatures have been variously categorised as lichens, fungi, and even as a halfway house between plants and animals.\n\nIn September, scientists were able to extract molecules of cholesterol from a fossilised Ediacaran life form called Dickinsonia, which resembled a flat jellyfish. Cholesterol is one of the molecular hallmarks of animal life, clearly demonstrating that the Ediacaran biota were animals.\n\nOther palaeontology stories from 2018\n\nGiant plastic berg\n\nThe world's plastic waste crisis was one of the big themes of 2018. The problem had been highlighted by the BBC's Blue Planet 2 series, presented by David Attenborough, which contained shocking footage of the devastation wrought on the oceans and marine life by our addiction to plastic.\n\nIn April, our Science Editor, David Shukman, visited Indonesia to report on a morass of plastic waste that had clogged rivers and canals in Bandung, on the Indonesian island of Java. The crisis was so acute, the army was called in to help clean up a vast plastic berg of bottles, bags and other plastic packaging.\n\nWorryingly, the problem only looks set to get worse. In March, a report commissioned by the UK government suggested the amount of plastic in the ocean could triple in a decade unless litter is curbed.\n\nOther plastic waste stories from 2018\n\nGhost particle busters\n\nImage copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Artwork: Blazars are powered by massive black holes\n\nNeutrinos are some of the fundamental building blocks of the Universe. These sub-atomic particles hurtle around the cosmos more-or-less unimpeded, interacting with very little. In fact, it's estimated that a single neutrino particle can pass through a light-year (about 10 trillion km) of lead without hitting a single atom.\n\nMany neutrinos we encounter on Earth come from the Sun or the Earth's atmosphere. But the origins of one group of ultra-high-energy neutrinos remained mysterious until this year. In July, an international team traced one of them to a distant galaxy firing a particle \"ray\" straight at the Earth.\n\nThis type of galaxy is called a blazar. It has an intensely bright core caused by the energy of its central, massive black hole. As matter falls into the hole, enormous jets of charged particles emerge, turning these galaxies into vast particle accelerators.\n\nThe IceCube experiment in Antarctica has been collecting data on these ultra-high-energy neutrinos for six years, but this was the first time researchers were able to match them with a source in the sky.\n\nOther astronomy stories from 2018\n\nA watery Mars - and Moon\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL/Malin Space Science Systems Image caption The proposed lake sits beneath ice near the south pole of Mars\n\nWe know there is water on Mars in the form of ice, and there are possible signs of occasional liquid flows. But in July, a team of scientists reported the discovery of a 20km-wide lake sitting under the planet's south polar ice cap.\n\nNasa's Curiosity rover has been exploring the rock remnants of an ancient lake bed, but this is the first sign of a persistent body of water today. The result was exciting because scientists have long hunted for signs of present-day liquid water on Mars.\n\n\"We are not closer to actually detecting life,\" said Manish Patel, from the UK's Open University, \"but what this finding does is give us the location of where to look on Mars.\"\n\nMars wasn't the only cosmic body making watery headlines. In August, researchers published what they said was the most definitive evidence yet for ice on the surface of the Moon.\n\nData from India's Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft suggests the presence of icy deposits at the north and south poles. This ancient water might be accessible as a resource for future human missions to the Moon.\n\nOther planetary science stories from 2018\n\nWhat happened to the Stonehenge builders?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Stonehenge builders were largely replaced by the Beaker people, but pockets may have lingered\n\nThe field of ancient DNA - which involves extracting and analysing genetic material from long-dead people - has provided us with unprecedented insights into the past. One striking result from 2018 was the discovery that the ancient people of Britain were almost completely replaced in a mass migration from the continent about 4,500 years ago.\n\nThe Neolithic Britons had just erected the big stones at Stonehenge when they were overrun by newcomers known as the Beaker people. This resulted in 90% of the British gene pool being replaced in just a few hundred years. Why this happened is unknown. But disease, famine and conflict are all potential candidates.\n\nIn a different study released in 2018, researchers showed that 50,000-year-old bone fragments from Russia belonged to a girl who was half Denisovan and half Neanderthal. The Denisovans and Neanderthals were distinct species of human who inhabited Eurasia before our species - Homo sapiens - left Africa.\n\nOther ancient DNA stories from 2018\n\nIcy impact\n\nImage copyright NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM OF DENMARK Image caption Space view: The semi-circular margin of the ice sheet traces the outline of the crater\n\nIn November, scientists identified what looked to be a large impact crater under the Greenland ice. The 31km-wide depression came to light when scientists examined radar images of the island's bedrock.\n\nThe bowl was probably excavated by a 1.5km-wide iron asteroid sometime between about 12,000 and three million years ago. Some researchers have their doubts about the evidence presented so far. But it has raised some intriguing possibilities, including a potential connection to a period of strong cooling that punctuated the climatic warming seen as the Earth emerged from the height of the last Ice Age.\n\nThere is a longstanding hypothesis that this dip in temperatures could have been the result of the sun's rays being blocked by debris thrown into the atmosphere by an impact and the smoke and ash from wildfires it set off. If further work confirms the age of the crater is close to the lower end of the age range, it could re-ignite interest in this old debate.\n\nOther earth science stories from 2018:\n\nAn earlier exodus\n\nImage copyright Israel Hershkovitz, Tel Aviv Uni Image caption The jawbone from Mislya cave in Israel dates to 185,000 years ago\n\nMultiple lines of evidence suggest that the ancestors of most humans living outside Africa left the continent in one migration 60,000 years ago. But there is some evidence that pioneer modern humans (Homo sapiens) made forays outside Africa before this time.\n\nIn January, scientists unveiled the jawbone of a modern human who died in Israel 185,000 years ago, tens of thousands of years earlier than previous evidence. Received wisdom suggests that these earlier excursions failed to provide modern humans with a permanent foothold in Eurasia.\n\nBut the jawbone fits in with the emerging picture of earlier out-of-Africa migrations that spread further into Eurasia than many had believed. These pioneers appear to have lived alongside other human species such as the Neanderthals and Denisovans. But it remains a mystery as to why their genetic signatures are not preserved in people alive today.\n\nOther human evolution stories from 2018\n\nRocks from Mars\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: The mission would allow Martian rock and soil samples to be studied in labs on Earth\n\nAfter years of discussion and one false start, the European and American space agencies made their first significant move towards bringing back rocks from Mars.\n\nIn April, Nasa and Esa signed a letter of intent that would lead to the first \"round trip\" to another planet.\n\nThe venture would allow scientists to start answering key questions about Martian history, including whether the planet once hosted life. But it would also allow geologists to start building an accurate chronology for events in Martian history.\n\nUS missions over the last few decades have contributed enormously to our understanding of the Red Planet in situ, but there are mass constraints on the experiments that can fit on a payload destined for Mars.\n\nThere's no comparison to the information scientists will be able to glean from studying Martian rocks and soil with the scientific instruments available in terrestrial laboratories.\n\nOther space exploration stories from 2018\n\nPlastic in our water\n\nImage copyright Alice Trevail Image caption Some of the fragments are very small\n\nPlastic waste is increasingly pervasive in our daily lives, and this extends to our drinking water. Research by the journalism organisation Orb Media found an average of 10 plastic particles per litre in major brands of bottled water.\n\nIn the largest investigation of its kind, 250 bottles bought in nine different countries were examined. Nearly all of them contained tiny plastic particles.\n\nOur planet's far north is often regarded as a pristine wilderness. But this year, researchers voiced their concern about the large concentrations of plastic building up in Arctic sea-ice.\n\nThe number of particles in just one litre of melted Arctic sea ice was found to be higher than in the open ocean. Scientists said there was a need for more research into its effects on zooplankton, invertebrates, fish, seabirds, and mammals.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."

      "Veronique Greenwood"
    ],
    "text": "The glittering bubbles of a glass of champagne are part of life\u2019s rituals, from wedding toasts to Sunday brunch. They come from a rather counter-intuitive process, however, and a clever chemical sleight of hand keeps the gas in even as winemakers open the bottles part-way through.\n\nIf you visit the Champagne region, you might be surprised to hear a champagne maker discuss adding a slurry of sugar and yeast to their wine. To the novice, it sounds like what you do at Christmas with a really bad red wine: dump in sugar, a bit of water, spices, get it on the boil, maybe add some kirsch \u2013 thus transforming cheap plonk into a mulled seasonal treat.\n\nBut the careful addition of sugar and yeast to a white wine is a central part of making any champagne. As the microorganisms digest the sugar, they release carbon dioxide that dissolves in the wine around them. They are the source of those characteristic bubbles.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u201cThere is a direct correlation between the number and size of the bubbles and the amount of the sugar,\u201d says Gerard Liger-Belair, a physicist at the University of Reims who studies the bubbles in champagne. The more sugar, the larger the bubbles and the more of them, as boosting the amount of energy available to the yeast means they release more gas.\n\nStrictly speaking, there aren\u2019t actually bubbles in the wine until you open it, reducing the pressure and allowing the gas molecules to come together suddenly out of solution \u2013 more bubbles form as the champagne makes contact with imperfections and speckles of dust on the interior of a champagne glass.\n\nThe yeast in the wine has of course long since died by the time it\u2019s decanted into a glass. But the tiny bodies have also been removed, because a champagne bottle does not stay inviolate between the addition of yeast and its arrival with the customer.\n\nIt might surprise you to learn that among the reactions that take place afterwards is the Maillard reaction, which also occurs when bread toasts, bacon fries, and onions caramelise\n\nTo get the sludge of yeast corpses, called lees, out of the wine, champagne makers tip the bottles upside down and store them in angled racks, going through every now and then to gently rotate the bottles. The lees end up down in the bottle\u2019s neck, settled together in a silty mass. (These traditional wooden racks are called pupitres; eventually it became possible to purchase a device charmingly named the Pupi-Matic that would turn the bottles itself.)\n\nWhat happens next is a brilliant bit of applied chemistry said to have been invented in 1884. The necks of the bottles are dipped in a very cold saltwater bath \u2013 colder, in fact, than 0C (32F). It\u2019s still liquid, because the salt lowers the freezing temperature of the solution, but it manages to solidify the mush in the neck of the bottle.\n\nThe bubble conundrum The link between bubble size and quality Does the size of the bubbles in a bottle of fizz bear any relation to the wine\u2019s quality? It was long thought that smaller bubbles might not be the best vehicle for releasing aromas \u2013 a vital part of flavour \u2013 but recent research suggests larger bubbles might be more common in cheaper varieties. According to physicist and lecturer Helen Czerski, listening to the pop of the bubbles as they hit the surface might be a clue to their size \u2013 with the smaller bubbles having a higher pitch.\n\nThen, with the cap removed, the pressure of the gas in the wine pushes the yeast-ice-cube out. This golden moment is when the winemaker slips in a little more sugar and some champagne, both to top off the bottle and to help transform it into a particular flavour profile. After this addition, called the dosage, the familiar champagne cork is swiftly added as well. All the carbon dioxide that the wine will ever have is already there, Liger-Belair says; the dosage is about flavour.\n\nIt might surprise you to learn that among the reactions that take place afterwards is the Maillard reaction, which also occurs when bread toasts, bacon fries, and onions caramelise. \u201cIn champagne, the Maillard reaction creates biscuity, brioche-like flavours over a long period of post-disgorgement ageing,\u201d writes Peter Liem in his authoritative 2017 book, Champagne. This reaction between proteins and sugars and others can produce intriguingly complex tastes, and Liem posits that most champagnes benefit from a year\u2019s worth of aging after having the lees removed, though they are usually released for sale at that time.\n\nThe best champagnes can age for several decades, but the cork is not actually hermetically sealed, so the longer you wait, the higher risk of a flat wine\n\nLiger-Belair is presently investigating how long it\u2019s possible to age a champagne without risking the loss of the bubbles. The best champagnes can age for several decades, but the cork is not actually hermetically sealed, so the longer you wait, the higher risk of a flat wine. \u201cWe work a lot with mathematical models\u201d of the cork and the dynamic environment inside the bottle, he says.\n\nWhen the champagne is ready to be opened, a gentle twisting motion on the bottle to loosen the cork will help keep its fizz in the wine and not in your lap. In a single bottle of champagne are five litres of carbon dioxide, Liger-Belair estimates. When you next open a bottle and enjoy the storm of bubbles, think of the delicate mix of biology and chemistry that brought them to life.\n\n--\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

Off camera \u2013 well let\u2019s just say he needs a lot of personal space. He hates being a celebrity. He resents being an actor. To his ex-girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley's friends he was apparently known as \u2018Grumpelstiltskin\u2019.\n\nHugh Grant may be famed for being moody and a little challenging to work with. But could a grumpy attitude be the secret to his success?\n\nThe pressure to be positive has never been greater. Cultural forces have whipped up a frenzied pursuit of happiness, spawning billion-dollar book sales, a cottage industry in self-help and plastering inspirational quotes all over the internet.\n\nNow you can hire a happiness expert, undertake training in \u2018mindfulness\u2019, or seek inner satisfaction via an app. The US army currently trains its soldiers \u2013 over a million people \u2013 in positive psychology and optimism is taught in UK schools. Meanwhile the \u2018happiness index\u2019 has become an indicator of national wellbeing to rival GDP.\n\nThe truth is, pondering the worst has some clear advantages. Cranks may be superior negotiators, more discerning decision-makers and cut their risk of having a heart attack. Cynics can expect more stable marriages, higher earnings and longer lives \u2013 though, of course, they\u2019ll anticipate the opposite.\n\nGood moods on the other hand come with substantial risks \u2013 sapping your drive, dimming attention to detail and making you simultaneously gullible and selfish. Positivity is also known to encourage binge drinking, overeating and unsafe sex.\n\nAt the centre of it all is the notion our feelings are adaptive: anger, sadness and pessimism aren\u2019t divine cruelty or sheer random bad luck \u2013 they evolved to serve useful functions and help us thrive.\n\nTake anger. From Newton\u2019s obsessive grudges to Beethoven\u2019s tantrums \u2013 which sometimes came to blows \u2013 it seems as though visionary geniuses often come with extremely short tempers. There are plenty of examples to be found in Silicon Valley. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is famed for his angry outbursts and insults (such as \u201cI\u2019m sorry, did I take my stupid pills today?\u201d) yet they haven\u2019t stopped him building a $300 billion company.\n\nFor years, the link remained a mystery. Then in 2009 Matthijs Baas from the University of Amsterdam decided to investigate. He recruited a group of willing students and set to work making them angry in the name of science. Half the students were asked to recall something which had irritated them and write a short essay about it. \u201cThis made them a bit angrier, though they weren\u2019t quite driven to full-blown fits of rage,\u201d he says. The other half of the group were made to feel sad.\n\nNext the two teams were pitched against each other in a game designed to test their creativity. They had 16 minutes to think of as many ways as possible to improve education at the psychology department. As Baas expected, the angry team produced more ideas \u2013 at least to begin with. Their contributions were also more original, repeated by less than 1% of the study\u2019s participants.\n\nAnger really prepares the body to mobilise resources\n\nCrucially, angry volunteers were better at moments of haphazard innovation, or so-called \u201cunstructured\u201d thinking. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re challenged to think about possible uses for a brick. While a systematic thinker might suggest ten different kinds of building, it takes a less structured approach to invent a new use altogether, such as turning it into a weapon.\n\nIn essence, creativity is down to how easily your mind is diverted from one thought path and onto another. In a situation requiring fight or flight, it\u2019s easy to see how turning into a literal \u201cmad genius\u201d could be life-saving.\n\n\u201cAnger really prepares the body to mobilise resources \u2013 it tells you that the situation you\u2019re in is bad and gives you an energetic boost to get you out of it,\u201d says Baas.\n\nTo understand how this works, first we need to get to grips with what\u2019s going on in the brain. Like most emotions, anger begins in the amygdala, an almond-shaped structure responsible for detecting threats to our well-being. It\u2019s extremely efficient \u2013 raising the alarm long before the peril enters your conscious awareness.\n\nThen it\u2019s up to chemical signals in the brain to get you riled up. As the brain is flooded with adrenaline it initiates a burst of impassioned, energetic fury which lasts for several minutes. Breathing and heart rate accelerate and blood pressure skyrockets. Blood rushes into the extremities, leading to the distinctive red face and throbbing forehead veins people get when they\u2019re annoyed.\n\nThough it\u2019s thought to have evolved primarily to prepare the body for physical aggression, this physiological response is known to have other benefits, boosting motivation and giving people the gall to take mental risks.\n\nAll these physiological changes are extremely helpful \u2013 as long as you get a chance to vent your anger by wrestling a lion or screaming at co-workers. Sure, you might alienate a few people, but afterwards your blood pressure should go back to normal. Avoiding grumpiness has more serious consequences.\n\nThe notion that repressed feelings can be bad for your health is ancient. The Greek philosopher Aristotle was a firm believer in catharsis (he invented the modern meaning of the word); viewing tragic plays, he conjectured, allowed punters to experience anger, sadness and guilt in a controlled environment. By getting it all out in the open, they could purge themselves of these feelings all in one go.\n\nHis philosophy was later adopted by Sigmund Freud, who instead championed the cathartic benefits of the therapist\u2019s couch.\n\nThen in 2010 a team of scientists decided to take a look. They surveyed a group of 644 patients with coronary artery disease to determine their levels of anger, suppressed anger and tendency to experience distress, and followed them for between five and ten years to see what happened next.\n\nOver the course of the study, 20% experienced a major cardiac event and 9% percent died. Initially it looked like both anger and suppressed anger increased the likelihood of having a heart attack. But after controlling for other factors, the researchers realised anger had no impact \u2013 while suppressing it increased the chances of having a heart attack by nearly three-fold.\n\nIt\u2019s still not known exactly why this occurs, but other studies have shown that suppressing anger can lead to chronic high blood pressure.\n\nAnd not all benefits are physical: anger can help with negotiating, too. A major flashpoint for aggression is the discovery that someone does not value your interests highly enough. It involves inflicting costs \u2013 the threat of physical violence \u2013 and withdrawing benefits \u2013 loyalty, friendship, or money \u2013 to help them see their mistake.\n\nSupport for this theory comes from the faces we pull when angry. Research suggests they aren\u2019t arbitrary movements at all, but specifically aimed at increasing our physical strength in the eyes of our opponent. Get it right and aggression can help you advance your interests and increase your status \u2013 it\u2019s just an ancient way of bargaining.\n\nIn fact, scientists are increasingly recognising that grumpiness may be beneficial to the full range of social skills \u2013 improving language skills, memory and making us more persuasive.\n\n\u201cNegative moods indicate we\u2019re in a new and challenging situation and call for a more attentive, detailed and observant thinking style,\u201d says Joseph Forgas, who has been studying how emotions affect our behaviour for nearly four decades. In line with this, research has also found that feeling slightly down enhances our awareness of social cues. Intriguingly, it also encourages people to act in a more \u2013 not less \u2013 fair way towards others.\n\nHarsh, but fair\n\nThough happiness is often thought of as intrinsically virtuous, the emotion brings no such benefits. In one study, a group of volunteers was made to feel disgusted, sad, angry, fearful, happy, surprised or neutral and invited to play the \u201cultimatum game\u201d.\n\nIn the game, the first player is given some money and asked how they\u2019d like to divide it between themselves and another player. Then the second player gets to decide whether or not to accept. If they agree, the money is split how the first player proposed. If not, neither player gets any money.\n\nHappier participants keep more of the prize for themselves, while those in a sad mood are significantly less selfish\n\nThe ultimatum game is often used as a test of our sense of fairness by showing whether you expect to get a 50-50 share or whether you are happy for each person to be in it for themselves. Interestingly, all negative emotions led to more rejections by the second player, which might suggest that these feelings enhance our sense of fairness and the need for everyone to be treated equally.\n\nReversing the set-up reveals this is not just a case of sour grapes, either. The \u201cdictator game\u201d has exactly the same rules except this time the second player has no say whatsoever \u2013 they simply receive whatever the first player decides not to keep. It turns out that happier participants keep more of the prize for themselves, while those in a sad mood are significantly less selfish.\n\n\u201cPeople who are feeling slightly down pay better attention to external social norms and expectations, and so they act in a fairer and just way towards others,\u201d says Forgas.\n\nIn some situations, happiness carries far more serious risks. It\u2019s associated with the cuddle hormone, oxytocin, which a handful of studies have shown reduces our ability to identify threats. In prehistoric times, happiness would have left our ancestors vulnerable to predators. In modern life, it prevents us paying due attention to dangers such as binge drinking, overeating and unsafe sex.\n\n\u201cHappiness functions like a shorthand signal that we\u2019re safe and it\u2019s not necessary to pay too much attention to the environment,\u201d he says. Those in a continuous happy haze may miss important cues. Instead, they may be over-reliant on existing knowledge \u2013 leaving them prone to serious errors of judgement.\n\nThose in a good mood were less able to think sceptically and were significantly more gullible\n\nIn one study, Forgas and colleagues from the University of New South Wales, Australia, put volunteers in either a happy or sad mood by screening films in the laboratory. Then he asked them to judge the truth of urban myths, such as that power lines cause leukaemia or the CIA murdered President Kennedy. Those in a good mood were less able to think sceptically and were significantly more gullible.\n\nNext Forgas used a first-person shooter game to test if good moods might also lead people to rely on stereotyping. As he predicted, those in a good mood were more likely to aim at targets wearing turbans.\n\nOf all the positive emotions, optimism about the future may have the most ironic effects. Like happiness, positive fantasies about the future can be profoundly de-motivating. \u201cPeople feel accomplished, they relax, and they do not invest the necessary effort to actually realise these positive fantasies and daydreams,\u201d says Gabriele Oettingen from New York University.\n\nGraduates who fantasise about success at work end up earning less, for instance. Patients who daydream about getting better make a slower recovery. In numerous studies, Oettingen has shown that the more wishful your thinking, the less likely any of it is to come true. \u201cPeople say \u2018dream it and you will get it\u2019 \u2013 but that\u2019s problematic,\u201d she says. Optimistic thoughts may also put the obese off losing weight and make smokers less likely to plan to quit.\n\nDefensive pessimism\n\nPerhaps most worryingly, Oettingen believes the risks may operate on a societal level, too. When she compared articles in the newspaper USA Today with economic performance a week or a month later, she found that the more optimistic the content, the more performance declined. Next she looked at presidential inaugural addresses \u2013 and found that more positive speeches predicted a lower employment rate and GDP in during their time in office.\n\nCombine these unnerving findings with optimism bias \u2013 the tendency to believe you\u2019re less at risk of things going wrong than other people \u2013 and you\u2019re asking for trouble. Instead, you might want to consider throwing away your rose-tinted spectacles and adopting a glass half-empty outlook. \u201cDefensive pessimism\u201d involves employing Murphy\u2019s Law, the cosmic inevitability that whatever can go wrong, will go wrong. By anticipating the worst, you can be prepared when it actually happens.\n\nIt works like this. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re giving a talk at work. All you have to do is think of the worst possible outcomes \u2013 tripping up on your way to the stage, losing the memory stick which contains your slides, computer difficulties, awkward questions (truly accomplished pessimists will be able to think of many, many more) \u2013 and hold them in your mind. Next you need to think of some solutions.\n\nPsychologist Julie Norem from Wellesley College, Massachusetts, is an expert pessimist. \u201cI\u2019m a little clumsy, especially when I\u2019m anxious, so I make sure to wear low-heeled shoes. I get there early to scope out the stage and make sure that there aren\u2019t cords or other things to trip over. I typically have several backups for my slides: I can give the talk without them if necessary, I email a copy to the organizers, carry a copy on a flash drive, and bring my own laptop to use\u2026\u201d she says. Only the paranoid survive, as they say.\n\nSo the next time someone tells you to \u201ccheer up\u201d \u2013 why not tell them how you\u2019re improving your sense of fairness, reducing unemployment and saving the world economy? You\u2019ll be having the last laugh \u2013 even if it is a world-weary, cynical snort.\n\n--\n\nJoin 600,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

Nothing that comes in a box. No more fluff, I've had enough. And I can buy my own damn stuff.\"\n\nShe went on to sing that she bought a car \"all by myself, Santa baby, with zero help from Elf on the Shelf\".\n\nShe finished with the line: \"Santa baby, I'd love to know my ass won't get grabbed at work, by some ignorant jerk.\"\n\nAt the start of the sketch, she also told Fallon she objected to the line \"slip a sable under the tree\".\n\n\"Do you even know what that is?\" she asked the talk show host. \"It's a fur and I'm vegan.\"\n\nSanta Baby is not the first Christmas song this year from Cyrus.\n\nShe has also released a version of John Lennon and Yoko Ono's Happy Christmas War is Over, recorded with their son Sean Ono Lennon and Mark Ronson.\n\nTheir new version only had a slight lyric change, replacing \"yellow and red ones\" with \"left and right ones\".\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

One is because she loves nothing more than to dance in the sunshine with a grapefruit G and T, laughing uncontrollably with the people she loves. The other is her mascara moment.\"\n\nEvans then went on to play the two songs dedicated to her - Michael Jackson's Love Never Felt So Good [the mascara moment song] and America by Razorlight.\n\nAs he left Radio 2 after the show, the DJ told the media: \"I feel sad and very happy and very excited. It's really strange.\"\n\nRadio 2's breakfast show is Europe's most popular radio programme, although Evans' ratings fell to a six-year low of 8.9 million this summer.\n\nThe presenter took over from Terry Wogan in 2010 and took listener figures to almost 10 million at their peak.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Nicole Kidman, who called in live from Australia, was among the guests on Evans's final show\n\nSpeaking on BBC One's The One Show last week, he said he was \"excited\" about his move, but admitted it was \"a shame\" to be doing his last show at Radio 2.\n\nHe said he started thinking about leaving after somebody pointed out how long he had been at the station.\n\n\"It is a shame, but Zoe is going to be on in January. Zoe's brilliant and I took over from Terry,\" he said.\n\n\"Terry was amazing, nobody could do that show like him so we had to do it a different way and Zoe can continue that.\n\n\"You're a steward of a show like this. The show isn't yours, you're the stewards of it and somebody else will come along, and I think that's a lovely thing.\"\n\nIt's not the end of his relationship with the BBC, though, because he also revealed he has said yes to taking part in Strictly Come Dancing next year.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nRick Astley, George Ezra, Richard Ashcroft, Stacey Dooley, Olly Murs and Paloma Faith were among his guests for his last full week.\n\nEvans will host the Virgin breakfast show from 21 January.\n\nHis new programme is being billed as the first commercial radio breakfast show without conventional advert breaks. Instead, it will be sponsored by Sky, and Evans will promote Sky's programmes during his slot.\n\nEvans was paid \u00a31.66m for hosting the Radio 2 breakfast show in 2017-18, and there have been reports that he will pocket \u00a32m a year from Virgin. But he has denied his move was about the money.\n\nIn September, BBC director general Tony Hall said the publication of star salaries was a factor in Evans and former Radio 4 presenter Eddie Mair choosing to leave the corporation.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

    "text": "Tom Bidwell is an Oscar-nominated and Bafta-winning writer, who adapted Rae Earl's novel 'My Mad Fat Diary' for E4 and Jacqueline Wilson's 'Katy' for CBBC. He has written the new adaptation of Richard Adams much-loved novel Watership Down, which comes to BBC One and BBC iPlayer on Saturday 22nd and Sunday 23rd December.\n\nYou must enable javascript to play content Watch the trailer for Watership Down\n\nTom, how did you get started in scriptwriting? Was it something you were doing even as a young child? I\u2019ve always been a bit of a fantasist. I remember when I was pretty young I convinced myself that I was a spy (probably the youngest person working in MI6 at the time). I wrote my first script in the playground at the age of 8 and got my friends to perform it in front of the class. It was a vignette about the dangers of eating too much chocolate - a message which still holds true to this day. I\u2019ve always found something very satisfying about structure too and gravitated towards form. I wrote quite a lot of sonnets at university because I enjoyed the puzzle of making the meter and rhyme fit. Later on I realised that when these two elements came together, the freedom of creativity and the form of structure, I found my work flowed more easily. I went to the University of East Anglia where I had a couple of great professors (Jonty Rea and Jonathan Hyde) who really believed in me. They gave me the confidence to make the transition from student to practitioner. I entered a short play I\u2019d written into the NSDF (The National Student Drama Festival) and got picked up there to do a play for BBC Radio 4. Have you had any involvement with BBC Writersroom in the past or was it influential in your development? I love the BBC Writersroom. It\u2019s an unbelievable resource. I went to a lot of seminars and workshops when I was first starting out. I also used the various calls for scripts as deadlines which helped me focus and made me feel like a proper writer. The feeling of being a proper writer is so important, knowing that someone is reading your scripts, taking you seriously. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a more valuable gift you can give a new writer when they\u2019re first taking on the blank page.\n\nTom Bidwell\n\nDid getting an Oscar nomination (for short film Wish 143) mark a defining moment in your career? Did things change for you after that? The Oscar nomination was a really strange, unexpected moment. I don\u2019t think it affected my career trajectory too much. I was still a pretty new writer, fresh out of the BBC Writers' Academy* so I was still learning and developing. In many ways I wasn\u2019t ready to showrun a major series because I needed experience. I remember having a general meeting at Dreamworks while I was out there for the Oscars and they asked whether I\u2019d like to pitch anything to them. I said - no, I\u2019m just enjoying being out here and meeting you guys. I\u2019ll come back and pitch when I\u2019m good enough. You have written across many different genres including children\u2019s (Katy), comedy drama (My Mad Fat Diary), Continuing Drama (Holby City, EastEnders, Casualty, Doctors). Is there a link between your approach to them? I approach every script in much the same way really - through story rather than through any expectations of genre, medium or theme. In the first instance I just focus on the narrative and the characters and trust that they will take me where I need to go. Much of my approach to story comes from my time at the BBC Writers' Academy with John Yorke which had a profound effect on my writing. Rather than teach you how to write it showed you how you are already writing, how everyone writes, and that understanding allows you to make better story decisions and make them more quickly.\n\nHazel and his gang survey the view from Watership Down\n\nHow did you become involved with Watership Down? My agent passed the offer on to me from 42 Productions. I\u2019m a huge fan of the novel and had read it a few times so I went in and talked to the guys about it and our ideas seemed to chime. Six years later it\u2019s about to be on TV. I\u2019ve aged terribly. Were you also a fan of the 1978 animated film? Why do you think this was a good time for a new version of Watership Down? Are the issues in the story of particular relevance? I think the film lives long in the memory because it\u2019s so visceral and because of its famous song. I like the film and I think it\u2019s a great piece of work in its own right but it\u2019s only 90 minutes long (the novel is over 600 pages). As such it doesn\u2019t really go deep enough into Richard Adams\u2019 wonderful story and characters. My vision for our version was to show how much of a fantastic world builder Richard was - to give it the scale and time it deserves and hopefully introduce his work to a new generation. The issues of environmentalism, despotism and fear are as relevant now as they ever were, if not more so. Because the themes are so exigent I decided to hit them pretty hard in certain areas of the story as there are certain things I\u2019d rather be too on the nose with than too subtle.\n\nHazel prepares the rabbits for battle against Woundwort\u2019s army\n\nWere there changes you wanted to make from the previous adaptations, or that were possible in this new version? I didn\u2019t reference the film at all in our adaptation as it\u2019s not a remake. My job in this instance was to adapt the novel. The major changes I made from the original story were that I added more female characters and gave them more agency. I also cut down the core cast of rabbits to add clarity and reduce overlap of character archetypes. Richard Adams was a brilliant storyteller and this work in particular has a very classical structure. My job here was mainly one of preservation. If I did change things in terms of narrative it was usually just because the demands of good drama and good prose aren\u2019t always the same. If people watch it and think something that I\u2019ve added was in the book then that is the win for me. That\u2019s the major win of this kind of adaptation. The goal is to become invisible. Do you listen to any of the chatter online, the social media and memes about Watership Down being too scary for children \u2013 or conversely that the new version might tone down the violence and sanitise it? It\u2019s hard after working on something for so long not to feel attached to it. Your ego takes it on as part of yourself so it can feel very personal when it\u2019s criticised. That aside I\u2019ve worked on this project with the team for six years so I care deeply about them as creatives and friends. It really does take a monumental amount of effort to create any amount of drama let alone nearly four hours of animation. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of what we\u2019ve achieved with the show. A lot of people said that on our budget it was simply impossible. Did you get to meet Richard Adams or discuss your vision of the story with him or his family? I did meet Richard. He was a true gentleman. I had tea and cake with him in his home near The Down then went on a tour of the places featured in the novel with his illustrator and daughter, Ros. He was very excited to know that this new adaptation was on its way and his family have been so supportive and positive. When you adapt something like this for so long, when you live in the world of it, a connection or understanding forms that is hard to put into words. I suppose you begin to understand a person\u2019s spirit. It\u2019s been a real privilege to have it as part of my life.\n\nYou must enable javascript to play content John Boyega: How Do You Prepare to Play a Rabbit?"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Charles Dickens was not only one of the greatest novelists of the 19th Century, but also an inspired actor and director, who performed A Christmas Carol around the country as a one-man show. Known for his innate ability to summon each of the 38 characters, Dickens was lauded for his ability to create a riveting world for his audience to inhabit.\n\nDickens couldn\u2019t have been more wrong about the real Scroggie\n\nIn a new production, Simon Callow takes the mantle of the author and conjures up Scrooge, Tiny Tim and Mr Fezziwig, and together with director Tom Cairns has shaped an immersive performance and binaural audio experience which reworks the classic tale.\n\nBut how did the author create Ebenezer Scrooge \u2013 \"a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner,\" as Dickens describes him?\n\nIt\u2019s been suggested that during a walk in Edinburgh\u2019s Canongate kirkyard in June 1841, Dickens came across the gravestone of one Ebenezer Lennox Scroggie. The gravestone gave \u2018meal man\u2019 as Scroggie\u2019s profession, referring to his trade as a merchant.\n\nSomehow Dickens misread this as \u2018mean man\u2019 and later wrote in his notebook: \"To be remembered through eternity only for being mean seemed the greatest testament to a life wasted.\"\n\nHe couldn\u2019t have been more wrong about the real Scroggie.\n\nResearch by political economist Peter Clark has shown that he had been a corn trader and vintner whose family had supplied Captain Cook\u2019s ship Endeavour as it charted the Pacific.\n\nScroggie imported wine in bulk and exported whisky in return, building a reputation and gaining royal patronage, leading to two years acting as Edinburgh\u2019s Lord Provost. He was a jovial man and a scallywag who once interrupted the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland by goosing the Countess of Mansfield.\n\nHe may have taken advantage of one of his servants too, having a child out of wedlock - not the behaviour you would expect from Dickens\u2019 Scrooge; well, maybe after the visitations.\n\nUnfortunately, the grave marker was lost during restoration of the Kirk in 1932. But there are plans to recognise Scroggie and his life by erecting a memorial and drawing attention to his literary influence."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Paddy Ashdown was the action man of British politics.\n\nA former Royal Marine officer, he was the first elected leader of the Liberal Democrats, a party then badly in need of some military-style discipline.\n\nHe led his party to its best election result for half a century but his combative style of leadership did not always sit easily with some activists.\n\nHis mixture of military and diplomatic experience meant he was well-suited for the role he later undertook in the former Yugoslavia.\n\nJeremy John Durham Ashdown was born in Delhi, India, on 27 February 1941, into an Irish family with a long record of service in the administration of the sub-continent. He boasted Irish nationalist leader Daniel O'Connell among his ancestors.\n\nHis father was an officer in the Indian Army who later faced a court martial for refusing to abandon his troops during the retreat to Dunkirk. The charges were eventually thrown out.\n\nOne of his earliest memories was seeing dead bodies in the streets, the result of conflict between Hindus and Muslims.\n\nImage copyright Family photo Image caption He saw active service with the Royal Marines in the Far East and Persian Gulf\n\nThe young Ashdown spent his childhood years on a farm his father had purchased in County Down, Northern Ireland, before attending Bedford School, in England, where his Irish brogue led to the nickname Paddy.\n\nHe did not always find school easy, with one report describing him as vain and a poor team-player. There was a sexual relationship with a female maths teacher which he described in his memoir, A Fortunate Life, as \"a rite of passage\".\n\nHe quit before taking his A-levels and joined the Royal Marines in 1959.\n\nAshdown saw active service in Borneo and the Persian Gulf before joining the elite Special Boat Service, the seagoing equivalent of the SAS.\n\nHorrified\n\nIn 1967, he went to Hong Kong where he learned Mandarin and qualified as an interpreter, before returning to Northern Ireland where he commanded a commando company in Belfast at a time when the Troubles were raging.\n\nAshdown quit the Royal Marines in 1972 and joined the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) where he worked with diplomatic cover in Geneva liaising with a number of United Nations departments.\n\nAlthough he was a Labour supporter he had shown little interest in politics so there was surprise when he decided to quit his comfortable life in Switzerland and become an active member of the Liberal party.\n\nImage copyright Rex Features Image caption He finally won Yeovil in 1983\n\n\"Most of my friends thought I was utterly bonkers,\" he later recalled, claiming he made the decision after being horrified at the state of the UK following the period of industrial unrest and fuel shortages in the mid-70s.\n\nIn 1976, he was selected as the Liberal candidate in his wife's home constituency of Yeovil which had been held by right-wing Tory MP John Peyton for more than two decades.\n\nWith what became a trademark energetic campaigning style, he set out to squeeze the Labour vote and, in the 1979 general election, took his party to second place, although still more than 10,000 votes behind Peyton.\n\nHaving given up a lucrative post with the foreign office, Ashdown took a job with a subsidiary of the Westland Helicopter company, based in Yeovil.\n\nProminent campaigner\n\nHe then moved on to work with Tescan, a processor of sheepskins, but found himself out of work when the firm closed in 1981.\n\nAs the personnel manager, he had to make his team redundant, something he described as \"the worst day of my life\". He was on the dole for six months before obtaining a job as a youth worker with Dorset County Council.\n\nHis continuing campaigning in Yeovil paid off in the 1983 election when John Peyton decided to stand down; he won the seat with just over 50% of the popular vote.\n\nImage copyright Topfoto Image caption He joined Neil Kinnock on a picket line at GCHQ\n\nIt was the era of the SDP-Liberal Alliance and Ashdown quickly found himself appointed as the Liberal spokesman on trade and industry.\n\nHe was a prominent campaigner against the stationing of American cruise missiles on British soil, describing them as \"the weapon we have to stop\".\n\nAshdown also spoke out against Margaret Thatcher's decision to allow the US to use bases in Britain to bomb Libya and was one of the harshest critics of the government's decision to ban workers at GCHQ from being members of a trade union.\n\nHe had become a popular figure in Yeovil, where he increased his majority over the Conservatives in 1987. He had gained a reputation as someone not afraid to speak his mind, but who did not suffer fools gladly.\n\nAffair\n\nIn 1988, the SDP and Liberal Party formally merged as the Social and Liberal Democrats, later shortened to the Liberal Democrats.\n\nWhen former Liberal leader David Steel declined to stand for the leadership of the new party, Ashdown comfortably saw off Alan Beith, the only other candidate.\n\nHe inherited a party licking its wounds after the arguments that had accompanied its formation and leading figures from both the Liberal and SDP camps walking away in protest at the merger.\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption He comfortably won the ballot to become leader of the Liberal Democrats\n\nAshdown threw himself into getting his party into shape for the 1992 election and it was to his credit that, despite all the problems, the new party suffered a net loss of just two seats.\n\nHis career, and his marriage, also survived press revelations of an affair with his secretary, five years previously, leading to one Sun headline dubbing him Paddy Pantsdown.\n\nA year later, Ashdown began negotiations with Labour leader John Smith over closer co-operation between the two parties. After Smith's death, he continued the talks with Tony Blair. It was the end of his party's historic stance of \"equidistance\" between Conservatives and Labour.\n\nHe developed a close rapport with Blair. One colleague said the two of them would \"sit at the cabinet table and fix their gaze on each other - they worked exceptionally closely together\".\n\nDisappointed\n\nThe relationship was remarkably candid with Ashdown once telling Blair that \"some folk think you are a smarmy git\".\n\nDespite early signs that Labour were on course to win the 1997 election, Ashdown still hoped that he could offer the support of the Liberal Democrats in return for Labour agreeing to voting reform.\n\nAlthough Blair was sympathetic, the Labour landslide of 1997 removed any need for Lib Dem support and the majority of Blair's new cabinet, sitting on a secure majority, were not in favour of moving to some form of PR.\n\nAshdown was also disappointed that Blair refused to share the Lib Dem leader's enthusiasm for joining the euro.\n\nIn the election, the Liberal Democrats increased their number of MPs from 18 to 46, as the Conservative vote crumbled. But it remained the third party in UK politics.\n\nAshdown stood down as Lib Dem leader in 1999 and was replaced by Charles Kennedy. Two years later, he quit the Commons and entered the Lords as Baron Ashdown of Norton-sub Hamdon.\n\nRetirement was far from his mind and, in 2002, his military and diplomatic experience saw him appointed as High Representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nEnergy\n\nHe had been a continuing advocate of intervention in the strife that followed the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia and he made a number of positive contributions to creating a stable framework of government.\n\n\"Bosnia is under my skin,\" he said. \"It's the place you cannot leave behind.\"\n\nHe appeared as a prosecution witness in the trial of the former Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, although his claim that he had watched Serbian shells falling on villages in Kosovo was disputed by the defence.\n\nHe was considered for the post of UN representative to Afghanistan in 2008 after he had called for a high-level co-ordinator to lead the foreign mission to the country, but ruled himself out of contention.\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Lord Ashdown campaigned with then-leader Nick Clegg ahead of the 2015 general election\n\nHe remained active in the Liberal Democrats. He often appeared as a pundit on radio and television and chaired the party's election campaign in 2015.\n\nAppearing on the BBC election results programme, he took issue with the Exit Poll which suggested the Lib Dems would end the night with 10 seats. Ashdown promised to \"eat his hat\" if the Exit Poll proved right. In the event, the party won just eight.\n\nAshdown campaigned vigorously against Brexit and waved away sympathy after the diagnosis of bladder cancer. \"I've fought a lot of battles in my life,\" he said.\n\nHe was a politician of great drive and energy, although some complained that he was not the most subtle or diplomatic of figures.\n\n\"It's not my job to be popular,\" he said. \"I'm goal-driven, my job is to get results.\"\n\nHe relished the cut and thrust of political life and its potential for throwing up the unexpected.\n\n\"If you make a mistake you usually pay the price very quickly,\" he said. \"It is what makes it more exciting and more terrifying than active service.\""

    "authors": [],
    "text": "3. A friendly name\n\nThe robin is one of the few birds in the English language with a human name. Robin is really a contraction and diminutive of \u201cRobert\u201d. The original word for the species was \u201cRuddock\u201d or \u201credbreast\u201d. Over time this was personalised with a Christian name as a mark of respect for its aura of friendship.\n\nThere were many historical taboos against harming robins, such as the belief that killing one would cause your cows to produce bloody milk. Children once thought that if they took eggs from a robin\u2019s nest they would develop bent fingers.\n\n4. A good honest church-going bird\n\nRobins are among our most ecclesiastical of birds. There are stories linking them to St Serf of Culross as long ago as the 6th century AD. It was believed that the species acquired its red breast when it tried to pull thorns out of Christ's crown during the Passion and became stained with his blood.\n\nThere have been regular examples of robins nesting inside religious buildings. In the reign of Charles II, one routinely sang from Canterbury Cathedral, while a particularly pious Bristol bird lived in the cathedral for years during the 19th century.\n\n5. On every mantelpiece at Christmas\n\nThe robin\u2019s associations with Christ and Christmas were reinforced in the 19th century when the newly created postal service dressed its delivery staff in red uniforms. The workers became known as \u201cRobins\u201d and when Christmas cards were popularised in the 1860s they were often illustrated with the postman\u2019s avian namesake. Today robins have a permanent perch on the modern Christmas mantelpiece."

(Photo courtesy The Christie Archive)\n\n2. She had a penchant for poison\n\nEarly in the First World War Christie worked with the VAD (Voluntary Aid Detachment) and later in the dispensary of the local hospital, where she completed the examination of the Society of Apothecaries and acquired an interest in and knowledge of poisons.\n\n3. Her husband was suspected of murdering her\n\n1926 saw both highlights and heartache for Christie. She became a household name with the publication of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd but she lost her mother that year and her husband revealed he was in love with his golfing partner, Nancy Neele. The result was an intriguing 11-day disappearance. Suffering from amnesia, Christie had signed herself into the Harrogate Hydropathic Hotel, where she registered as Teresa Neele. Police and bloodhounds searched for her. Colonel Christie was suspected of murdering her and only when a member of the hotel band recognised her and reported it was Agatha considered safe. She never recovered her memory from that time. Agatha divorced Archie Christie in 1928. Michael Apted\u2019s 1979 film Agatha, starring Vanessa Redgrave and Dustin Hoffman, is a fictional account of those 11 days."

He's the Starman who fell to Earth, and wrote an entire album in character as an androgynous rock star operating as an earthly messenger for aliens (1972's ...Ziggy Stardust). But perhaps most notably, David Bowie's Space Oddity, was released on 11 July 1969, nine days before Neil Armstrong took a giant leap for mankind by being the first human to step foot on the moon.\n\nHowever, the song was actually informed by Bowie's fascination with space as a whole, especially influenced by Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey. \"In England, it was always presumed that it was written about the space landing, because it kind of came to prominence around the same time. But it actually wasn't,\" he later said. \"It was written because of going to see the film 2001, which I found amazing... it was really a revelation to me.\"\n\nDespite not specifically being written for it, Space Oddity still owes much of its success to the hysteria surrounding that Apollo 11 voyage. Space Oddity was even played during the TV coverage of Apollo 11 at the time despite lyrics like \"Ground control to Major Tom, your circuit's dead, there's something wrong\", which wouldn't have exactly instilled optimism in a generation looking to the stars.\n\nBut while the influence of our solar system on Bowie\u2019s Space Oddity is well-known, less so is its effect on space travel itself. In 2013, Space Oddity finally reached orbit. Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield shot to viral fame with his cover of Space Oddity aboard the International Space Station, with the song later featuring on Hadfield\u2019s Space Stations: Songs From A Tin Can LP - the first album to be (partially) recorded in space. To accommodate a studio in the tiny vessel, Hadfield performed on a slim acoustic guitar to a tablet-attached microphone. It was worth it, as in the ultimate seal of approval Bowie himself praised Hadfield\u2019s cover as \"possibly the most poignant version of the song ever created.\""

    "text": "It might surprise you to learn that there are conservationists on four legs as well as two.\n\nThe practice is actually nothing new, particularly in New Zealand where early conservationist Richard Henry trained his pet dog to sniff out rare local birds for protection in the 1890s. Realising that imported stoats were having a devastating impact on species such as kiwi and kakapo, Henry relied upon his pooch to help translocate birds to a reserve on Resolution Island. While this early effort was thwarted by swimming stoats, it paved the way for the world\u2019s first government-backed conservation dogs programme, established in 1998. The rest of the world have steadily been catching on to the benefits since.\n\nAgile and loyal, dogs have many qualities that recommend them for field work, but it\u2019s their nose that puts them ahead of many of their human counterparts. It\u2019s not that humans have a bad sense of smell, scientists have found we can detect up to a trillion different scents, but dogs come equipped with a super-powered nose as standard. Moist surfaces trap odour molecules, but dog noses are also remarkably sensitive \u2013 they have around 220 million olfactory receptors compared to 5 million in the human nose. These receptors detect smells and send signals to the brain, and dogs dedicate proportionately 40 times more of their brain to scent analysis than we do.\n\nAdd in a suite of other adaptations that allow dogs to filter the air they breathe in to a dedicated smelling area at the back of the nose, retain a scent after they\u2019ve exhaled and determine which nostril detected a certain aroma, and you\u2019ve got an extremely sophisticated smelling machine.\n\nNevertheless, if you\u2019re a dog owner, you might be most familiar with your pet using their sense of smell for apparent evil \u2013 seeking out poop. Next time your pooch gleefully rolls in a pile of something stinky, you can think of the dogs that are being purposefully trained to save endangered animals by sniffing out scat. According to a review of scientific studies featuring conservation dogs, around half of them focus on patrolling for poo. Worldwide, dogs have helped scientists to track snow leopards, koalas, gorillas and even killer whales by following their nose to the muck.\n\nScientists use dogs to track whales \u00a9 Conservation Canines\n\nJennifer Hartman is a research scientist at the University of Washington\u2019s Conservation Canines (CK9) facility which is home to 20 specially trained sniffer dogs. The CK9 team took on the tricky task of tracking orca poo, which only floats on the ocean\u2019s surface for a limited time.\n\n\u201cThe whale team utilizes the wind and tide table to understand how the water is moving and the captain of the boat drives in transects perpendicular to the wind. Meanwhile the handler and dog are on the bow and the handler directs the captain with minute adjustments to the transect based on the dog's behaviour,\u201d explains Hartman.\n\nBy successfully tracking and sampling the excrement, scientists can check on the health of the Southern resident orca population, which faces profound environmental stress from disrupted food supplies, pollution and boat traffic.\n\nFor their co-operation, the dogs receive their favourite treat. \u201cWe reward our dogs for locating target odours by playing ball,\u201d says Hartman. \u201cThey can be any breed, most any size, but they all have to have one thing in common: an extreme obsession to play ball.\u201d says Hartman. She explains that around 98% of the dogs are from rescue shelters, given up by owners who could not match their energy levels. Enthusiastic pups are a must for the programme, but handlers need to match this with patience, curiosity and hard work. \u201cPairing a conservation dog with their handler is critical to the success of the work,\u201d says Hartman.\n\nThese dogs certainly have their work cut out for them but have so far risen to the challenges of finding not only sporadic orca poop, but the buried scats of Chinese pangolins, tiny Pacific pocket mouse droppings and even the minute frass of silverspot butterfly caterpillars, which Hartman compares to \u201cpepper flakes\u201d.\n\nAfter the scat sniffers, the next most common task for conservation dogs is live animal detection. With their years of experience, New Zealand is considered global leaders in the use of conservation dogs for seeking out hard to find species. But they\u2019re also putting paws on the ground to tackle the invasive aliens that threaten the future survival of their unique wildlife. Many working dogs were first bred to be pest controllers in agricultural settings; now conservation dogs are used to find introduced rats and stoats on NZ\u2019s island safe havens, feral cats in Australia, mongooses in Japan \u2013 even mussels and ants in the US that cause destruction and upset ecosystems.\n\nIt\u2019s just one of the ways dogs are being employed to keep human activity in check. They have helped to survey wind farms in order to gauge bat fatalities \u2013 one trial showed how dogs were more than three times better at finding bat carcasses than humans. Dogs are also used at Kenya\u2019s Mombasa port to sniff out illegal wildlife products, including rhino horn and ivory. At the end of August 2018, WWF, TRAFFIC and Kenya Wildlife Service started trialling a new method to boost how many shipments the dogs could sniff. By filtering air samples through special sniff pads, the dogs are able to work in a climate-controlled room instead of slogging around the docks in the hot sun visiting each container.\n\nDogs make for great conservationists \u00a9 Conservation Canines\n\nElsewhere in Africa there are dogs working at the extreme frontline of conservation. Daryll Pleasants is the founder of Animals Saving Animals, an organisation dedicated to training dogs that take on poachers. Pleasants explains that their training is similar to that of police dogs since they are \u201cmanaging a crime scene\u201d. They must be able to locate where weapons have been fired, find evidence, track poachers through both rural and urban environments and ultimately apprehend them.\n\n\u201cAlthough dogs are not a silver bullet in the fight against poaching they are a huge security force multiplier,\u201d says Pleasants. \u201cOne dog is able to secure the same area as seven rangers with the detection skills to indicate on the presence of poacher up to a kilometre away in favourable conditions and the ability to track at night... Without doubt anti-poaching teams are now successfully fighting back and owning the conservancy at night which used to be the poacher\u2019s killing field.\u201d\n\nThe image of a handler repelling from a helicopter with a specially trained dog ready to take down wildlife criminals is a powerful one. For centuries we\u2019ve described the dog as man\u2019s best friend, now it seems that special relationship can be extended to help protect the world\u2019s most vulnerable species too.\n\nBy Ella Davies\n\nFeatured image by Conservation Canines"

It initially flopped at the box office, making close to $6m (\u00a34.7m) compared with a budget of $15m (\u00a311.8m).\n\nAnother example is Girl, Interrupted which earned Angelia Jolie the best supporting actress win in 2000 but failed to achieve box office returns.\n\nWhen it comes to financial success, it is actually \"man in a hole\" films - an emotional fall followed by a rise - that come out on top, regardless of genre or production budget.\n\nHow it works\n\nUsing a filtering process, we selected 6,147 films released between 1935 and 2018 and added up Oscar nominations in all categories.\n\nOur machine learning algorithm then split each film script into sentences.\n\nEach sentence was given a score calculated by averaging the sentimental value of each word. An emotionally negative term scored minus one, an emotionally neutral term scored nought, and an emotionally positive term scored one point.\n\nImage copyright Alamy Image caption Toy Story 3 is an example of a \"riches to rags\" emotional journey\n\nThe total sentiment for each film was accumulated and overlaid on to the span of the film, to map the emotional arc.\n\nFilms were then grouped based on the similarity of their emotional arc. By doing this, scientists discovered that films, like novels, all fitted within six standard emotional journeys:\n\nRags to riches: a continuing emotional rise (eg The Shawshank Redemption, Groundhog Day, The Nightmare Before Christmas)\n\nRiches to rags: a continuing emotional fall (eg Psycho, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Toy Story 3)\n\nMan in a hole: a fall followed by a rise (eg The Godfather, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Sixth Sense)\n\nIcarus: A rise followed by a fall (eg On the Waterfront, Mary Poppins, A Very Long Engagement)\n\nCinderella: \"rise-fall-rise\" (eg Rushmore, Babe, Spider-Man 2)\n\nOedipus: \"fall-rise-fall\" (All About My Mother, As Good as It Gets, The Little Mermaid)\n\nFollowing the money\n\nIf man in a hole films are the most profitable, should the entertainment industry just make those?\n\nThe answer is probably not, for several reasons.\n\nWhile those films do make the most money, we discovered that the right combination of genre and budget can produce a financially successful movie of any emotional shape.\n\nImage copyright Alamy Image caption Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring is an example of the financially successful \"man in a hole\" structure\n\nFor example, the \"Icarus\" arc - a rise followed by a fall - is good for low budget films, such as 2005's family drama Junebug.\n\nHowever, if you want to shoot a financially successful tragedy, then it helps if it is epic, with a large budget of over $100m (\u00a378m).\n\nSad superheroes\n\nSuperhero films are a perfect example of this.\n\nIn this genre, man in a hole films become only the second most profitable after epic tragedies, ie riches to rags films with plenty of funding.\n\nHowever, superhero tragedies seem to attract bigger than average budgets anyway - $186m (\u00a3147m) - and bring in an average revenue of $310.5m (\u00a3245m).\n\nLooking at all the mainstream Batman films, you can see the top performers were the epic tragedies - the Dark Knight films.\n\nSci-fi, mysteries, and thrillers with happy endings - the rags to riches shape - do not tend to do well at the box office.\n\nThis includes the Wachowskis' sci-fi epic Cloud Atlas, which flopped at the box office in 2012, making $27m (\u00a321.3m) in the US against a budget of about $128.5m (\u00a3101.5m)\n\nEqually, it is not a good idea to shoot a comedy with a sad ending.\n\nMore like this\n\nImage copyright Alamy Image caption Tom Hanks and Halle Berry starred in sci-fi epic Cloud Atlas, which had a budget of about $128.5m (\u00a3101.5m)\n\nWriting by robot\n\nThe entertainment industry tends to make ad hoc, top-down decisions about the content offered to the viewer.\n\nDetermining which films get the green light is based primarily on the intuition, expertise and experience of a relatively small group of producers and studio executives, with limited input from focus groups.\n\nCould machines do better?\n\nRecently, a bot was \"employed\" to produce a sci-fi film, with nonsensical and sometimes hilarious results, highlighting how far automated scriptwriting still has to go.\n\nThat's because robots still aren't very good at replicating the nuances of human emotion, especially humour, and struggle to write scripts to which people can relate.\n\nBut we can use data science to enhance the efforts of human scriptwriters and production companies.\n\nTime will tell whether these new techniques will actually shift decision-making about film content from producers to the viewers.\n\nAbout this piece\n\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.\n\nGanna Pogrebna is a fellow at The Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national centre for data science and artificial intelligence.\n\nShe is also a professor of behavioural science at the University of Birmingham.\n\nEdited by Eleanor Lawrie"

The names of the original crew members are Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen \u2013 based on the 1823 poem 'The Night before Christmas'. But another Christmas classic, 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer', led to the star of the song being added to the list too.\n\nFor centuries, the reindeer has been the sled-puller of choice for inhabitants of the snowy Polar Regions. The large mammal has to survive temperatures as low as -40\u00b0C! It does so thanks to the hollow hairs, tight against its body - trapping heat and covering the curly layer of fur underneath. And its large hooves spread its weight, allowing it to walk on snow. Reindeer can also travel further than any other land mammal: the North American herds might walk more than 5,000km on their annual migration to the Arctic \u2013 making them a fitting choice for the legendary, long-distance Christmas sleigh-pullers!"

    "text": "Here\u2019s a blizzard of brrillliant snow-driven facts\u2026\n\nWhether you love frolicking in the white stuff at the first sign of a snowflake or prefer bundling up and hibernating until the spring thaw, or even if you\u2019ve only ever dreamed of touching a snowball, here\u2019s a blizzard of brrillliant snow-driven facts\u2026\n\nSnow is not white\n\nMind blown. You can certainly dream of a white Christmas, even if it isn\u2019t strictly accurate. As any good snow pedant will tell you, the \u2018white stuff\u2019 isn\u2019t actually white, but rather translucent. It\u2019s the light reflecting off it that makes it appear white with the many sides of the snowflake scattering light in many directions, diffusing the entire colour spectrum. Snow can also appear in a wide variety of spectacular hues. Dust, pollution or cold-loving (cryophilic) fresh-water algae can colour it black, orange or blue. Pink or \u2018watermelon snow\u2019, caused by algae containing astaxanthin, a chemical similar to the one found in carrots, was mentioned in the early writings of Aristotle.\n\nSnowflakes of many designs\n\nOne of the determining factors in the shape of individual snowflakes is the air temperature around it. The study of flakes has identified that long, thin needle-like ice crystals form at around -2 C (28 F), while a lower temperature of -5 C (23 F) will lead to very flat plate-like crystals. Further changes in temperature as the snowflake falls determines different shapes of the six arms or dendritic structure of the crystal.\n\nOne of the determining factors in the shape of individual snowflakes is the air temperature around it \u00a9 Westend61/Getty\n\nA catalogue of snowflakes\n\nCreator of the Compound Interest science blog, Andy Brunning, has painstakingly catalogued 35 different types of snowflake (plus a few other types of frozen precipitation). They are designated as column, plane, rimed, germs, irregular plus a number of combinations of all of them.\n\nGrown from a nucleus\n\nSnowflakes or snow crystals don\u2019t have nuclei in the traditional, biological way (that contains genetic information), but they all do form around one single particle whether that\u2019s a speck of dust or a piece of pollen. This makes it completely different from sleet (which consists of frozen raindrops) or hail (which is sleet droplets that collect water as they fall). This original piece of material that formed the flake can be detected using a powerful microscope.\n\nSnowflakes get big\n\nFor decades there have been stories of giant snowflakes falling all over the globe, measuring anywhere from two to six and even, on one occasion, 15 inches across. While many have doubted these reports and pointed out the lack of corroborating evidence, scientists now claim there\u2019s nothing to stop flakes growing that big. As flake size isn\u2019t part of the meteorological measuring designations for snow, these massive flakes may well be out there, but just unreported, unseen or broken up by wind currents as they descend.\n\nSnow affects sound\n\nFreshly fallen snow absorbs sound waves, giving everything a seemingly hushed, quieter ambience after a flurry. But if the snow then melts and refreezes, the ice can reflect sound waves making sound travel further and clearer.\n\nThere are hundreds of words for it\n\nIt\u2019s often stated that the Inuit have 50 words for snow, a fact that was discredited as pure speculation, and then confirmed as roughly accurate. No matter how many they actually have, it pales in comparison to the Scots. Researchers at the University of Glasgow claim that the Scots language has 421 terms related to the white stuff, including \u2018skelf\u2019 (a large snowflake), \u2018spitters\u2019 (small drops of driving snow) and \u2018unbrak' (the beginning of a thaw).\n\nIt\u2019s hard to define\n\nSpeaking of language, you must be careful if you\u2019re ever tempted to refer to a snowstorm as a \u2018blizzard\u2019. Snowfalls must meet a strict set of stipulations to be considered a blizzard. Visibility must be below 200m while the wind has to reach speeds of around 48kmp (30mph).\n\nSnow on Mars\n\nAccording to Nasa\u2019s scientific simulations (corroborated by remote robots on the planet\u2019s surface), during the summer in the north of Mars there may well be sudden, violent snow storms. We know there are clouds and subsurface ice on Mars, so snow is certainly plausible. Scientists also detected a cloud of carbon dioxide snowflakes over the southern pole of the planet.\n\nMonkeys love it\n\nDon\u2019t think for a second we are the only mammals to enjoy a good snowball fight. Japanese macaques, also know as \u2018snow monkeys\u2019 have been observed making and playing with balls of snow. Young macaques appear to enjoy stealing each others snowballs, then battling to retrieve them.\n\nJapanese macaques live further north than any other monkey in the world. They have been known to play with snowballs \u00a9 Julia Wimmerlin/Getty\n\nToo much snow isn\u2019t good for you\n\nSpend too much time on the slopes and you could suffer from piblokto or \u2018Arctic hysteria\u2019, a disorder affecting Inuit people living within the Arctic circle. Symptoms include meaningless verbal repetition or performing irrational or dangerous acts, followed by amnesia of the event. Vitamin A toxicity is thought to be one source of the disorder, though in recent years researchers have questioned whether the illness, thought to be based on as little as eight cases, actually exists at all.\n\nAfraid of snowfall\n\nOne psychological condition that definitely exists is chionophobia, or a fear of snow, deriving from \u2018chion' the Greek word for snow. While the phenomena can develop due to a childhood trauma involving snowy accident, there are more irrational variations where people develop an acute fear of becoming trapped or buried in snow if there isn\u2019t a flake in sight or at the first sign of a flutter.\n\nSnow rock stars\n\nThe great explorer Ernest Shackleton was renowned for his bravery, intrepid spirit and loyalty to his comrades. But the contents of his medical kit during the Nimrod Expedition sounds more like the rider for a 70s rock band than a polar exploration. Colic was treated with cannabis, diarrhoea sufferers enjoyed the delights of opium while those stricken with snow blindness, a temporary loss of vision due to overexposure to the sun's UV rays, would have cocaine dripped directly into the eye.\n\nA yodel won\u2019t cause an avalanche\n\nThere are a number of factors that can trigger an avalanche, but noise isn\u2019t one of them. Weight is a much more important contributor. A sudden deluge of snow, an increase in wind speed or even the over-zealous footstep of a skier can trigger a sudden, deadly, cascade. But a loud burst of terrible singing, that won\u2019t have much of an effect.\n\nSnow warms you up\n\nBecause snow is comprised of 90 to 95 percent trapped air, it means it\u2019s a great insulator. This is the reason many animals burrow deep into the snow during winter in order to hibernate. It\u2019s also the reason that igloos, that use only body heat to warm them, can be 100 degrees warmer inside than outside.\n\nIt\u2019s adaptable\n\nUsually, the air temperature needs to be around the freezing mark for snow to form, but if rain falls for long enough it can cool the air around it as it falls and eventually create the right environment to produce flakes. So the temperature can be as high as 6\u00b0C on the ground and snow can still be falling.\n\nBecause snow is comprised of 90 to 95 percent trapped air, it means it\u2019s a great insulator. This is the reason many animals burrow deep into the snow during winter in order to hibernate. \u00a9 Nicolas Le Boulanger/Getty\n\nSpeedy snowflakes\n\nSnowflakes can fall at a speed anywhere between a leisurely one to a breakneck 14kmp (9mph), depending on the environmental conditions in the air as they drop. Snowflakes gathering water as they fall and wind direction can speed up the descent. It takes roughly an hour for a flake to leave its cloud and reach the ground.\n\nBy Dale Shaw\n\nFeatured image by Malorny/Getty"

George Michael appeared on that first Band Aid single and, being the class act that he is, also donated all funds from Last Christmas to the same appeal. Incredibly, Last Christmas went to No.2 the following year, and No.6 in 1986, and it has subsequently revisited the UK charts 14 times since its initial release.\n\nA year on from the death of Michael, who in a strange twist of fate passed away last Christmas Day, means it could finally top the Christmas chart in 2017.

The lightest species of owl is the Elf Owl. Around six inches tall when fully grown, it is the size of a sparrow and weighs less than a golf ball! The largest owl in the world is the Eurasian Eagle-Owl, with females growing to a length of around 75cm. It has distinctive tufts of feathers on its head, which are often mistaken for ears.\n\n2. In English folklore, owls have long been considered a harbinger of doom. An owl flying past a window, or heard overhead, was thought to warn of an impending death in the household.

But a fiver will get you nowhere.\n\nImage caption Pub customers were given notice about the switch - a few have complained\n\nSigns dotted around the pub announced the move to customers: \"Apologies, but it is the digital age.\"\n\nFour of the firm's pubs now refuse cash, with the remaining two set to turn their backs on notes and coins in the New Year.\n\nWhat began as a move to deter thieves has turned out to be a timely business decision, according to Mr Rozhaja.\n\nFor staff at London Village Inns' businesses, the benefits of working in a cashless public house include not having to count up endless piles of coins at the end of the night. And managers no longer need to travel across town with bags of cash to be lodged at the bank.\n\nThere are even additional charges to processing cash transactions versus digital ones, says Mr Rozhaja.\n\nHe adds that while he's had a few complaints from customers, the response has generally been positive. There has been no discernible fall in business.\n\nImage caption Arber Rozhaja believes going cashless has not harmed his business at all\n\n\"It's a short time for me to have a proper analysis but if it was bad you would see straight away,\" he says.\n\nBut is cash dying out in the UK? And what about the rest of the world?\n\nIt was only in September that a pub in Suffolk claimed to be the first in the UK to go cashless. A string of \"cashless caf\u00e9s\" has cropped up in Britain, too.\n\nAnd establishments that turn down \"hard\" currency are becoming more common all over the world.\n\nTake the trendy eateries in New York, for example, which say \"no\" to readies. Or the new supermarket in Singapore where robots pack your bags and banknotes are futile. Even Ikea in Sweden has experimented with a cashless outlet.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption While more establishments are going digital only, cash is far from dead yet\n\nCash, as Mr Rozhaja found, is often a hassle. And if it accounts for a negligible fraction of turnover, why not drop it?\n\nIkea found that so few people - 1.2 in every 1,000 - insisted on paying in cash that it was financially justifiable to offer them free food in the shop cafeteria instead.\n\n\"It's slightly surprising to me that there aren't more of these cashless places already,\" says Dave Birch, director of payments at Consult Hyperion, a research consultancy.\n\nHe feels that some societies are embracing the cashless revolution more quickly than others.\n\n\"I was in Australia last week where the use of contactless is near ubiquitous. In fact, if you don't tap to pay for something it's regarded as rather strange already,\" he explains.\n\nGetting rid of cash frees up retail staff so they can spend more time with customers, adds Mr Birch. And tills stuffed with grotty banknotes don't clutter up serving space.\n\nUK Finance, a trade association, projects that in Britain cash will be used in just one fifth of all sales by 2026. In the last year alone, 4,735 cash machines have disappeared, according to research by Paymentsense.\n\nMore Technology of Business\n\nBut although cash may be taking a drubbing in some quarters, it remains stubbornly resistant.\n\nAccording to US-based market research firm McKinsey, cash \"will be around for a long time\".\n\n\"Some [customers] prefer cash for reasons of privacy and security,\" a recent report notes. \"Others live in areas where poor cellphone coverage and frequent electricity outages make cash the most reliable way to pay.\"\n\nIt chimes with a recent survey carried out in the UK, Australia, Brazil and South Africa by currency exchange company Travelex. The research found that about a quarter of people would always refuse to go cashless - despite technological changes and the rise of digital payments.\n\n\"Cashless technologies will not replace cash completely... people are happier with an equilibrium between the two,\" Travelex notes.\n\nIn many countries in Europe, the volume and value of ATM cash withdrawals is falling - but in some places the figures are rising.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption In some countries, such as China, cash is still the main method of payment\n\nWherever the use of cash remains high, businesses may find that there are regulatory or legal barriers to going cashless.\n\nIn July, for example, China's central bank said that companies and individuals should not refuse cash from customers. And in early December, Chinese retailer Hema was reprimanded by the bank for only accepting digital and card-based payments.\n\nChina is an interesting case study.\n\nWhile city centres are rapidly embracing new technology and the affluent middle class may be happy to go digital, according to McKinsey the country is still an \"emerging\" market in terms of cashless payments. More than 80% of Chinese retail transactions are still cash-based.\n\nThere are also ethical considerations.\n\nSome argue that cash-free establishments are discriminatory as they make it more difficult, or impossible, for homeless customers or those without bank accounts to shop there. Such concerns have led to legal challenges against cashless establishments in the US.\n\nSo is Mr Rozhaja worried about putting off people from a low or no-income background?\n\n\"No, it's easy to get a prepaid cash card online. Especially in London, I don't think it's possible for you to operate if you don't have some sort of a card,\" he says.\n\nBut tensions around the issue mean that societies should now be trying to put in place cost-effective infrastructure for digital payments \"for everyone\", says Dave Birch.\n\nSo while cash is undoubtedly declining, it is certainly not on its deathbed yet.\n\n\"A cashless society is not a society that literally has no cash in it,\" concludes Mr Birch. \"It's a society where cash is economically irrelevant and I think we're heading towards that.\""

    "text": "The winter months are the most popular time of year for getting engaged \u2013 and when at least some of us start prioritising our search for a relationship. But it turns out we might be going about romance all wrong.\n\nCould online dating make you look more attractive? Is it better to be like your partner? Are married couples truly happier long-term? And is monogamy the best option?\n\nThe answers might surprise you. BBC Future rounds up some of our favourite \u2013 and most counterintuitive \u2013 insights from research around the world.\n\nYou don\u2019t really have a \u2018type\u2019 \u2013 and neither does anyone else\n\nOnline dating is one of the most popular ways to meet a mate \u2013 but feeling like one profile out of a million can be intimidating. It might be heartening to know amidst the stream of faces, the face we saw before influences how attractive we perceive the next one to be.\n\nThis finding suggests that our perception of beauty, far from being deeply ingrained, is in fact very much fleeting. So, if someone is swiping along to your dating app profile, it may not be a bad thing to be among a sea of other people\u2019s well-chosen, flattering pictures.\n\nThe fact that such glances from dating app users are generally very quick may also work in our favour. Psychologists have found that faces are subject to a \u2018glimpse effect\u2019, which makes faces appear more attractive the less we look at them. The reason behind this, researchers suspect, is that this encourages us to give faces we see in passing a closer second look, lest we hastily miss out on a particularly handsome potential mate.\n\nOpposites don\u2019t always attract\n\nThere are some traits that tend to be beneficial to share with your partner, but it\u2019s not entirely true that opposites attract. Some of these are traits that are generally popular to have in a partner no matter what your own personality is like, such as being agreeable and not too neurotic.\n\nBut sometimes the best traits to have in a partner vary depending on your own character. For people who have an anxious attachment style and worry about being abandoned, for example, having a more similar personality overall boosts couples\u2019 relationship satisfaction. And other factors, such as whether you are early birds or night owls, also are best to match.\n\nBut sometimes, finding your own character mirrored in another person might be a turn-off. For example, when it comes to conscientiousness, research suggests that it\u2019s better for one partner to be a bit more (or less) conscientious than the other \u2013 it helps you balance each other out.\n\nYes, marriage makes you happier \u2013 but not forever\n\nIf you and your partner are well-matched, maybe you\u2019ll get hitched. But what does that mean for your personality \u2013 and happiness?\n\nResearch shows that marriage makes long-lasting changes to people\u2019s personalities. A four-year study of 15,000 Germans revealed that after marrying, people showed a decrease in openness and extraversion \u2013 a pattern perhaps all too familiar to the friends of the newly-wedded.\n\nOn the upside, people also have reported getting better at self-control and forgiveness after getting married \u2013 essential qualities to maintain a long-term relationship. But of course, that\u2019s just their own view. Whether their spouse agrees with them is another matter.\n\nAs for the smugness? It may come from the fact that your married friends really do think they\u2019re happier \u2013 at least for a while. Life satisfaction among couples did increase after marriage \u2013 but after a few years of marriage, life satisfaction returns to baseline levels.\n\nHow break-ups change your personality\n\nResearch has also revealed what appears to be the opposite of the \u2018smug married couple\u2019 effect: people experience personality changes after the end of a long-term relationship too.\n\nStudies of middle-aged people who had gone through a divorce, for example, showed that women became more extroverted and open after cutting ties with their spouse.\n\nMen, on the other hand, didn\u2019t handle the break-up quite so well. They tended to become more neurotic and more conscientious after the divorce. And in general, both male and female divorcees tend to become less dependable after their break up.\n\nIt also works two ways \u2013 as well as break-ups changing your personality, your personality affects how you will recover after a break-up. More extroverted types tend to remarry quicker, while more neurotic types have a tendency to go in for a series of shorter relationships after a divorce.\n\nA more open romantic future\n\nOf course, monogamy is not the only option. Polyamory, a relationship style with more than two people involved, may be a growing trend. Unlike cheating in a monogamous relationship, in polyamory this happens openly and with consent.\n\nResearch has shown that polyamorous couples maintain stronger friendships outside their love life than monogamous couples do. One online study also found that people in polyamorous relationships were more likely to practice safe sex.\n\nBut if you aren\u2019t polyamorous yourself, don\u2019t worry \u2013 you\u2019re not necessarily missing out on all the fun. People drawn to a polyamorous relationship may simply be more open to more relationships (including friendships) to begin with.\n\nAnd research has shown that, overall, people in polyamorous relationships have more or less the same psychological wellbeing and relationship quality as monogamous couples.\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "text": "Avoiding meat and dairy products is one of the biggest ways to reduce your environmental impact, according to recent scientific studies.\n\nBut what is the difference between beef and chicken? Does a bowl of rice produce more climate warming greenhouse gases than a plate of chips? Is wine more environmentally friendly than beer?\n\nTo find out the climate impact of what you eat and drink, choose from one of the 34 items in our calculator and pick how often you have it.\n\nHow do your food choices impact on the environment? Don't cry because you can't play with our interactive. Update your browser to have a go! How do your food choices impact on the environment? Which food would you like? How often do you have it? Find out Your results are below Kilograms of greenhouse gases per serving Choose another item Find out\n\nAll figures for each food in the calculator are global averages. If you cannot view the food calculator, click to launch the interactive content.\n\nDesign by Prina Shah, development by Felix Stephenson and Becky Rush.\n\nFood production is responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming, according to a University of Oxford study.\n\nHowever, the researchers found that the environmental impact of different foods varies hugely.\n\nTheir findings showed that meat and other animal products are responsible for more than half of food-related greenhouse gas emissions, despite providing only a fifth of the calories we eat and drink.\n\nOf all the products analysed in the study, beef and lamb were found to have by far the most damaging effect on the environment.\n\nThe findings echo recommendations on how individuals can lessen climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nWhen it comes to our diets, the IPCC says we need to buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter - but also eat more locally sourced seasonal food, and throw less of it away.\n\nThe IPCC also recommends that we insulate homes, take trains and buses instead of planes, and use video conferencing instead of business travel.\n\nCutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by two-thirds, according to the Oxford study, published in the journal Science.\n\n\"What we eat is one of the most powerful drivers behind most of the world's major environmental issues, whether it's climate change or biodiversity loss,\" study researcher Joseph Poore told BBC News.\n\nChanging your diet can make a big difference to your personal environmental footprint, from saving water to reducing pollution and the loss of forests, he said.\n\n\"It reduces the amount of land required to produce your food by about 75% - that's a huge reduction, particularly if you scale that up globally,\" Poore explained.\n\nIf you fly regularly, replacing flying with other forms of transport may have a bigger impact on your carbon footprint than changing your diet. A passenger's carbon footprint from a one-way flight from London to New York is just under half a tonne of greenhouse gases. Switching from a regular petrol vehicle to an electric car could save more than double that over a year.\n\nKnowing how and where your food is produced is also important, as the same food can have huge differences in environmental impact.\n\nFor example, beef cattle raised on deforested land is responsible for 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than cows reared on natural pastures.\n\nThe average beef from South America results in three times the amount of greenhouse gases as beef produced in Europe - and uses 10 times as much land.\n\nMeat and dairy are not the only foods where the choices you make can make a big difference.\n\nChocolate and coffee originating from deforested rainforest produce relatively high greenhouse gases.\n\nFor climate-friendly tomatoes, choose those grown outdoors or in high-tech greenhouses, instead of in greenhouses heated by gas or oil. Environmentally-minded beer-drinkers may be interested to know that draught beer is responsible for fewer emissions than recyclable cans, or worse, glass bottles.\n\nEven the most climate-friendly meat options still produce more greenhouse gases than vegetarian protein sources, like beans or nuts.\n\nHow did we make the calculator?\n\nHow is the environmental impact calculated?\n\nUniversity of Oxford researcher Joseph Poore, and Thomas Nemecek of the Agroecology and Environment Research Division in Zurich, Switzerland, looked at the environmental impact of 40 major food products that represent the vast majority of what is eaten globally.\n\nThey assessed the effect of these foods on climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of land and fresh water used across all stages of their production, including processing, packaging, and transportation, but excluding the cooking process.\n\nBy analysing data from nearly 40,000 farms, 1,600 processors, packaging types and retailers, Poore and Nemecek were able to assess how different production practices and geographies have very different consequences on the planet.\n\nWhat about serving sizes?\n\nThe data in the study looked at the environmental impact for 1kg of each of the different food products.\n\nFor this story, these were converted to impact per serving sizes based on serving sizes from the British Dietetic Association (BDA) and healthy diet portion sizes from BUPA.\n\nThe figures for serving sizes based on the BDA and BUPA suggestions are often lower than portion sizes commonly found in restaurants and what people normally expect, so the figures returned by the calculator on the impact of individuals' consumption are likely to be higher in reality.\n\nProtein-rich foods were calculated using the impact per 100g of protein from Poore and Nemecek's research and data on protein per serving from the BDA, to avoid differences between cooked and uncooked foods.\n\nWhat are greenhouse gases?\n\nThe figures for greenhouse gas emissions are in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq). This is a unit that converts the impact of different kinds of greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide.\n\nHow do you know what my diet is equal to in miles driven?\n\nThe annual impact from eating a specific food is calculated by multiplying the impact of one serving of that food by the times it is eaten in a year, based on the weekly estimates submitted by the user.\n\nThese are then compared with the emissions of other daily habits. The European Environment Agency estimates that driving a regular petrol car produces 392g of CO2eq/mile over its entire lifecycle, including emissions from the vehicle's production, fuel production and exhaust emissions per mile.\n\nHeating the average UK home produces 2.34 tonnes of CO2eq annually, according to data from the Committee on Climate Change, and a passenger's carbon footprint for a return flight from London to Malaga is 320kg CO2eq, based on figures from the Carbon Neutral calculator.\n\nThe land used to produce the annual consumption of each food is compared with the size of a double tennis court, 261 metres squared.\n\nThe annual amount of water used is compared with a shower, based on figures suggesting the average shower lasts eight minutes and uses up 65 litres. Only \"blue water\", i.e. water taken out of rivers or the ground, is included in the data."

    "text": "As she headed to her lab one sunny Texan morning, molecular biologist Meng Wang couldn\u2019t yet guess what would be waiting for her when she arrived: tens of thousands of worms, wriggling around in different boxes. As she peered into each box, slowly it dawned on her. What she saw could cure the most debilitating condition known to humanity: ageing.\n\nDiseases related to ageing \u2013 like cancer, rheumatism and Alzheimer\u2019s \u2013 kill 100,000 people every day around the world. But a growing number of scientists say it doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\n\nBBC World Service podcast The Inquiry quizzed some of the world\u2019s leading researchers about the nature of ageing \u2013 and about the cutting-edge science that could \u2018cure\u2019 it, from the role of microbiomes to 3D-printed organs.\n\nLong tooth\n\nWhat exactly is ageing? If you could zoom into the molecular level, you would see small, incremental amounts of damage that spreads to the cells, the tissue and the organs. Eventually, the whole organism starts to suffer from this ongoing Russian-doll style accumulation of damage.\n\n\u201cThen when we can\u2019t keep up with the repairing, the ageing starts\u201d explains Danish physician Kaare Christensen.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 The quest to cure ageing like a disease\n\n\u2022 The secrets of living to 200 years old\n\n\u2022 The benefits of getting older\n\nChristensen worked as a doctor for many years until one day he decided he\u2019d had enough of treating sick people. He now runs the Danish Aging Research Centre where he\u2019s trying to stop people getting ill in the first place.\n\nHe points out that we\u2019ve seen some progress. In the mid-1800s life expectancy was around 40 years in most of the world, he says, while now some countries of Northern Europe are nearing 80 years and the rest of the planet is catching up.\n\nThis was largely because of the reduction in infant and child mortality, not because the human life span itself increased. (Find out more in our recent story: Do we really live longer than our ancestors?).\n\nEven so, there has been another, promising change at the same time.\n\n\u201cPeople arrive at higher ages in better shape now,\u201d says Christensen. \u201cOne easy thing to observe is, for instance, teeth. You can see that the teeth of elderly people are getting better and better for every decade.\u201d\n\nTeeth are a sort of barometer of general health, he says. Their condition directly affects our ability to eat properly and gain nourishment. Their fitness can also indicate whether other parts of the body are in good shape.\n\nChristensen says that people are not only reaching old age with better teeth, but also with higher results in IQ tests, which he links to improved livelihoods around the world.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the whole package of better living conditions, better schooling\u2026 and what kind of work you have had,\u201d he says.\n\nHe believes that this progress will continue. But for how long?\n\nThe record for the world\u2019s longest recorded lifespan currently belongs to Frenchwoman Jeanne Louise Calment, who reached 122 years of age. What\u2019s interesting is that she died in 1997 \u2013 more than 20 years ago. Many things have happened since.\n\nOrgan printing\n\nBiophysicist Tuhin Bhowmick comes from a family of medics in Bangalore, India, and remembers dinner conversations about patients his father or uncles could not save. Whenever he asked why they were not able to prevent a death, his father would reply they had run out of tricks up their sleeve. Medicine, after all, had its limits.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Okay, then I won't become a doctor, but I'll become somebody who makes the medicine\u2019,\u201d remembers Bhowmick.\n\nHe says death by old age often relates to malfunctions with vital organs like the heart, the lungs or the liver. If the patient is able to receive a functional organ from a donor, medics like Bhowmick\u2019s father can give people a second lease of life. But that\u2019s not always the case.\n\nThe problem is that there are more people in need of organs than donors able to give them. Elderly people all over the world are in long queues for new kidneys or hearts, but exact matches have to be found. In many cases, the person dies waiting.\n\nInstead of holding out for a donor organ, Bhowmick thought, what if you could make one? This question kickstarted his quest to print a functioning organ that patients\u2019 bodies would not reject.\n\n\u201cLet's say you need a liver and you have CT scan or you have MRI which shows exact size and shape of your organ in the computer,\u201d he says. You could feed that \u2018mould\u2019 to a 3D printer and print an artificial one in exactly the same size and shape.\n\nInstead of using an ink cartridge, though, Bhowmick\u2019s devices use ink made up of protein and cells \u2013 and not just any cells, but the patient\u2019s own cells. This means there is very little chance that the body would reject the new organ.\n\nHis team already has made India\u2019s first artificial human liver tissue; the next step is to scale it up, making a miniature external liver, a checkpoint that he estimates might be five years away. Bhowmick imagines this external organ as a small and portable out-of-the-body device, so users can move around with it.\n\nIn eight to 10 years, he expects to reach the promised land: a point where he can make a fully functioning liver that can be transplanted inside a body.\n\nBut if a person has got a failing organ, does that indicate that perhaps they're coming to the end of a natural lifespan? What if the heart and lungs also fail?\n\nBhowmick believes each case is different.\n\n\u201cIf you replace an organ which has been the primary cause of the patient's death, that patient could have lived for 20 more years because maybe that person's liver was failing, but not the same with the brain or the heart,\u201d he says.\n\nHis bet for how long we can live? With these types of innovations, he says, if you are a millennial or younger \u2013 born by 1981 or later \u2013 you could have a good shot at lifespan of 135 years.\n\nWorm wisdom\n\nMeng Wang\u2019s grandmother passed away when she was aged 100; she was healthy and active to the end of her life. Watching her grow older, all while remaining sound, made Wang wonder about the secrets of ageing.\n\nWang is now a professor of molecular and human genetics at Baylor College of Medicine in the US, where she\u2019s been carrying out experiments into one of the most exciting new areas of medicine \u2013 our microbiome.\n\n\u201cThose are the little microorganisms living together with us, from the digestive tract inside our body to the skin outside our body,\u201d she says. \u201cSo, they\u2019re everywhere.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t see it with the naked eye, but our microbiome is all over (and inside of) us. Most of it is bacteria, but it also contains fungi, viruses and other microbes, too. In the past, scientists haven\u2019t given it much attention. But we now know it has a profound effect on our body.\n\nRecent studies show that our microbiome is as relevant to us as an additional organ might be. It can influence how we behave and even how well we respond to different medications.\n\n\u201cSometimes [our microbiomes] make us sick, but on the other hand, they also play a very important role to keep us healthy,\u201d says Wang.\n\nShe wanted to know whether our microbiome could affect ageing. To test it, she decided to work with a particular kind of worm that lives only two to three weeks \u2013 a lifespan short enough to conduct a \u2018life-long experiment\u2019 on ageing. Her question was what would happen if you altered a worm\u2019s microbiome. Would the worm live longer?\n\nWang chose one of the kinds of bacteria that lives inside a worm\u2019s gut, tweaked its genes to make different varieties, and then fed the bacteria to separate groups of worms. Three weeks later \u2013 by the time they should have all died \u2013 she checked on them.\n\n\u201cI was so excited because we found in a few cases the animals were not dead,\u201d she remembers. \u201cThey were still alive when we checked them.\n\n\u201cI was jumping up and down because it was totally unexpected.\u201d\n\nOlder worms usually show a decline in physical activity, but the ones with the new microbiome not only wriggled around more quickly in their old age, but were less susceptible to disease too.\n\nWang is now carrying out tests on mice to see whether changing their microbiome extends their lives in a similar way.\n\nThere\u2019s a chance that one day doctors might be able to prescribe pills which do the same for us. How long could that make us live?\n\n\u201cSome of my colleagues say, \u2018Okay, you know, I think people can live to 200, 300 years\u2019,\u201d says Wang. \u201cPersonally, I think, you know, 100\u2026 is already a good number.\u201d\n\nCell-by date\n\nSomething odd happens when you age. As cells gets older, they divide to replace cells that are dying or getting worn out, but this is not a perfect process. The more times a cell divides, the greater it\u2019s chance of becoming what we would call \u2018senescent\u2019.\n\nSenescence comes from the Latin word senescere \u2013 to grow old. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened to these cells \u2013 they\u2019ve grown old and come to the end of their lifecycle. But instead of dying, they hang around, acting in a destructive manner and communicating with cells around them. That can cause a lot of trouble.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like the cell saying \u2018I\u2019m an old cell and you guys have been around here about the same sort of amount of time as I have, so you must be old too\u2019,\u201d says Lorna Harries, professor of molecular genetics at England\u2019s University of Exeter.\n\nThese senescent cells are almost \u2018contaminating\u2019 other cells with age and as we grow older, more and more of our cells become senescent until our body is overwhelmed.\n\nIn her lab, Harries might have found a way to deal with these ageing hooligans. Some time ago, Harries suggested that a new researcher she was working with try putting some chemicals on old skin cells to see what would happen.\n\nTo test the skin cell\u2019s age when the experiment ran its course, they applied a particular dye that would turn cells blue if they were senescent.\n\n\u201cWhat I was expecting to see is that the cells would be still blue and still looking old,\u201d says Harries. \u201cAnd actually they weren\u2019t\u2026 they had gone back to looking more like young cells.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t believe the result, so she asked the student to repeat the experiment. Again and again, she came back with the same result \u2013 and again Harries sent her back to redo the process.\n\nThe researcher repeated it about nine times, Harries recalls. \u201cFinally, I kind of looked at it and thought \u2018Actually, maybe you\u2019re onto something here\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe experiment effectively rejuvenated old cells and turned them into young cells, making hers the first experiment ever to have reversed ageing in human cells. Some think the discovery could be the secret to a much longer life. Harries started receiving phone calls from investors and scientists around the world.\n\nBut Harries still isn\u2019t very bullish about how long could we live; she believes humans have a natural maximum lifespan. Even so, she hopes her line of research ends up in a new generation of anti-degenerative drugs for things like dementia and cardiovascular disease.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m hoping is that this will allow us one treatment which will address several of those at once, so that people who would have died early will then go on to live their natural allotted lifespan,\u201d says Harries.\n\nSo back to the question: how long could we live?\n\nPerhaps one day we will be able to replace our damaged organs, take supplements that give us a youthful microbiome and stop our cells from ageing.\n\nHow many years could all this add on? If we go by Tuhin Bhowmick\u2019s prediction, if you\u2019re a millennial, you may be able to get to 135. And by the time we\u2019re there \u2013 in 2116, if you were born in 1981 \u2013 who knows what else will be possible?\n\n----\n\nThis story is adapted by Diego Arguedas Ortiz from an episode of the BBC World Service podcast The Inquiry, which was produced by Beth Sagar Fenton and was presented by Helena Merriman.

    "text": "There can be few days more nerve-wracking than your own wedding, and few things as hard to express as the emotions that you might feel in the countdown. When it was Olympic and Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray\u2019s big day, however, he managed to capture precisely those feelings in a tweet that moved the world. Yet what made this tweet so special was the fact that rather than using words, Murray wrote the whole thing using just emojis.\n\nFrom getting ready in the morning to the trip to the church, the rings, the photographs, the celebrations, the drink, the love, and lots and lots of sleep, Murray\u2019s tweet, in part, heralded the rise of a brand new form of communication. This was the rise of the emojis, which linguistics professors such as Vyvyan Evans, author of The Emoji Code: The Linguistics behind Smiley Faces and Scaredy Cats, would soon declare to be \u201cincontrovertibly the world\u2019s first truly universal form of communication\u201d, and even \u201cthe new universal language\u201d.\n\nIf emojis really were the world\u2019s very first global lingua franca, why would anybody need them to be translated?\n\nSo when in 2017 business psychology expert Keith Broni was hired by Today Translations as the world\u2019s first ever Emoji Translator, this posed a difficult question. If emojis really were the world\u2019s very first global lingua franca, why would anybody need them to be translated?\n\nBroni explains that this is because \u2013 beyond the hype \u2013 emojis are in essence neither \u201cuniversal\u201d, nor a true \u201clanguage\u201d. Instead, they are \u201cat most a linguistic tool that is being used to complement our language\u201d. In other words, emojis do not and cannot by themselves constitute a meaningful code of communication between two parties. Rather, they are used as a way of enhancing texts and social media messages like a kind of additional punctuation.\n\nIf you enjoy this, you may also like:\n\nThat is not to diminish the value that emojis do offer, however. Broni believes that in the modern era, emojis are solving a problem that has dogged prose and all texts since time immemorial. The inherent limitations of the written form has deprived all but the most talented of writers of the ability to express nuance, tone and emotion in their correspondence.\n\nWhat emojis now offer is a chance for the average email writer, SMSer or social media poster to imply an emotional context to their messages, to express empathy. With emojis, they can do this as simply and naturally as using a facial expression or gesture when talking to somebody face-to-face.\n\nThe timing of the rise in the popularity of emojis may be no coincidence either. As our electronic communications have become shorter, snappier, and started looking more like sentences we would drop into a conversation, there is a growing need to include our feelings and emotions in these messages in other ways. Otherwise, without the accompaniment of a smile or sympathetic tone of voice, a one-liner message runs the risk of being misinterpreted as negative, bossy or even rude.\n\nYet relying too heavily on emojis to bridge that gap can cause problems of its own. We may all have access to more or less the same emojis through our smartphone keyboards, but what we mean when we use those emojis actually varies greatly, depending on culture, language, and generation.\n\nWhile the thumbs-up symbol may be a sign of approval in Western culture, traditionally in Greece and the Middle East it has been interpreted as vulgar and even offensive.\n\nEqually, in China, the angel emoji, which in the West can denote innocence or having performed a good deed, is used a sign for death, and may be perceived as threatening.\n\nSimilarly, the applause emojis are used in the West to show praise or offer congratulations. In China, however, this is a symbol for making love, perhaps due to its resemblance to the sounds \u201cpah pah pah\u201d (\u556a\u556a\u556a).\n\nIn China the slightly smiling emoji is not really used as a sign of happiness at all\n\nBut perhaps most confusingly, in China the slightly smiling emoji is not really used as a sign of happiness at all. As it is by far the least enthusiastic of the range of positive emojis available, the use of this emoji instead implies distrust, disbelief, or even that someone is humouring you.\n\nOne good indicator of the lack of universality amongst emoji use was highlighted by a study of how Muslims expressed their thoughts regarding Ramadan in 2017. Hamdan Azhar of prismoji.com showed that tweets with the #ramadan in English, German, Spanish and Turkish were most likely to contain the red heart emoji. However, in Arabic, Urdu and Farsi the most commonly used emoji was the crescent moon.\n\nEqually, in English, French, German, Spanish, Turkish, Farsi and Indonesian, the clasped hands emoji ranked consistently in the top three of all emojis used, while in Arabic it ranked ninth and was not amongst Urdu\u2019s most commonly used emojis at all.\n\nThis is perhaps an indicator of the fact that joining the palms it is not traditionally associated with Islamic prayer, although in the West the symbol carries plenty of religious significance. In Japan, where emojis originate, the symbol is generally used as to mean \u2018please\u2019 or \u2018thank you\u2019, without necessarily evoking religious connotations.\n\nHowever we intend our emojis to be interpreted, in recent years their use landed a number of people in legal hot water. Consider the following case from Israel earlier this year. After viewing a property, the prospective tenants had sent a message to the potential landlord with a series of celebratory emoji. Unfortunately, the prospective tenants later backed out, but the landlord had already taken the property off the market. A judge later ruled that the emoji were themselves enough to imply their intent to rent \u2013 and awarded the landlord 8,000 shekels (around $2,000 or \u00a31,600) of damages and legal fees as a result.\n\nYet as long as people remain mindful of the cultural context, Keith Broni remains confident that the little pictograms do have the power to bring the world closer together, rather than drive it further apart.\n\nHe concludes: \u201cThe pros outweigh the cons. Provided that we are aware of the epistemological pitfalls that emojis bring to the fore, we can use them to disambiguate certain meanings and appreciate the emotional intent of somebody\u2019s message in a way that was never possible before.\u201d\n\n--\n\nAlex Rawlings is a polyglot and writer, who in 2012 was named Britain\u2019s Most Multilingual Student after being tested for fluency in 11 languages.

You can find our FAQs on voting here.\n\nWho is on the shortlist?\n\nWe can't say just yet because for the first time, the award's shortlist will be unveiled during the show, before viewers are invited to vote for the recipient later in the broadcast.\n\nSo who has decided who should be on the list for the main award? The panel are:\n\nSir Chris Hoy (former Olympian & Spoty winner)\n\nBarry McGuigan (Former boxer & Spoty winner)\n\nAmy Williams (former Olympian & Spoty nominee)\n\nCaroline Barker (Broadcaster)\n\nAlex Scott (former footballer & broadcaster)\n\nEmma Boggis (chief executive, Sport & Recreation Alliance)\n\nClaire Tolley (sport features editor, Guardian)\n\nDavid Gurney (sports editor, Metro Newspapers)\n\nHoward Wheatcroft (group head of sport, Express Newspapers)\n\nBarbara Slater (Director, BBC Sport)\n\nPhilip Bernie (Head of TV Sport, BBC Sport)\n\nCarl Doran (Executive Editor, BBC Sport)\n\nAs well as the main award shortlist, the panel also decided:\n\nShortlist for World Sport Star of the Year\n\nShortlist for Greatest Sporting Moment of the Year\n\nWinner of the Team of the Year\n\nWinner of the Coach of the Year\n\nWhat about the musical acts on the night?\n\nThere will be live musical performances from George Ezra, Paloma Faith and Freya Ridings, plus a live performance of Three Lions by The Lightning Seeds featuring Baddiel and Skinner.\n\nWhat has happened in previous years?\n\nThe show itself is never just an awards ceremony - there's always plenty of talked-about moments.\n\nIn 1977, Grand National champion Red Rum dropped into the studio for a 'chat'. Yes, a racehorse in a television studio! Watch it for yourself below.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device SPOTY @60: Red Rum pays a visit to the studio in 1977\n\nIn 2012, 14,000 people did the Poznan in the ExCel Arena in London and, in 2007, World Superbike champion James Toseland performed a stunning piano solo.\n\nBut often the standout moments are those that remind you how sport can mean so much more than winning or losing - like the moment Muhammad Ali was named the Sports Personality of the Century, or when Martine Wright was presented with the Helen Rollason award having lost both her legs in the London bombings on 7 July 2005, only to compete in the Paralympics in 2012.\n\nAnd who can forget last year's show when Farah was upstaged by his young son?\n\nWhat surprises await us this year?

    "text": "Broken and scorched black by fire, the dense, wedge-shaped marks etched into the ancient clay tablets are only just visible under the soft light at the British Museum. These tiny signs are the remains of the world\u2019s oldest writing system: cuneiform.\n\nDeveloped more than 5,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, the land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers where modern-day Iraq now lies, cuneiform captured life in a complex and fascinating civilisation for some three millennia. From furious letters between warring royal siblings to rituals for soothing a fractious baby, the tablets offer a unique insight into a society at the dawn of history.\n\nThey chronicle the rise of fall of Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia, the world\u2019s first empires. An estimated half a million of them have been excavated, and more are still buried in the ground.\n\nHowever, since cuneiform was first deciphered by scholars around 150 years ago, the script has only yielded its secrets to a small group of people who can read it. Some 90% of cuneiform texts remain untranslated.\n\nThat could change thanks to a very modern helper: machine translation.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 The chefs who never taste food\n\n\u2022 The aircraft designer who\u2019s never flown\n\n\u2022 What single word defines who you are?\n\n\u201cThe influence that Mesopotamia has on our own culture is something that people don\u2019t know much about,\u201d says \u00c9milie Pag\u00e9-Perron, a researcher in Assyriology at the University of Toronto. Mesopotamia gave us the wheel, astronomy, the 60-minute hour, maps, the story of the flood and the ark, and the first work of literature, the Epic of Gilgamesh. But its texts are mainly written in Sumerian and Akkadian, languages that relatively few scholars can read.\n\nPag\u00e9-Perron is coordinating a project to machine translate 69,000 Mesopotamian administrative records from the 21st Century BC. One of the aims is to open up the past to new research.\n\n\u201cWe have information about so many different aspects of the lives of Mesopotamian people, and we can\u2019t really profit from the expertise of people in different fields like economics or politics, who if they had access to the sources, could help us tremendously to understand those societies better,\u201d says Pag\u00e9-Perron.\n\nApart from the clay tablets, there are also more than 50,000 Mesopotamian engraved seals scattered in collections around the world. For millennia, the people of Mesopotamia used seals made of engraved stone that were pressed into wet clay to mark doors, jars, tablets and other objects. Only some 10% of these have even been catalogued, let alone translated.\n\n\u201cWe have more sources from Mesopotamia than we have from Greece, Rome and ancient Egypt together,\u201d says Jacob Dahl, a professor of Assyriology at the University of Oxford. The challenge is finding enough people who can read them.\n\nPag\u00e9-Perron and her team are training algorithms on a sample of 4,000 ancient administrative texts from a digitised database. Each records transactions or deliveries of sheep, reed bundles or beer to a temple or an individual. Originally impressed into the clay with a reed stylus, the texts have already been transliterated into our alphabet by modern scholars. The Sumerian word for big, for example, can be written in cuneiform signs, or it can be written in our alphabet as \u201cgal\u201d.\n\nThe wording in these administrative texts is simple: \u201c11 nanny goats for the kitchen on the 15th day\u201d, for example. This makes them particularly suitable for automation. Once these algorithms have learned to translate the sample texts into English, they will then automatically translate the other transliterated tablets.\n\n\u201cThe texts we\u2019re working on are not very interesting individually, but they\u2019re extremely interesting if you take them as groups of texts,\u201d says Pag\u00e9-Perron, who expects the English versions to be online within the next year. The records give us a picture of day to day life in ancient Mesopotamia, of power structures and trading networks, but also of other aspects of its social history, such as the role of female workers. Searchable translations would enable researchers from other areas to explore these rich facets of life in the ancient world.\n\nUnderstanding Mesopotamia is a way of understanding what it means to be human - \u00c9milie Pag\u00e9-Perron\n\n\u201cThese people are so different and so remote from us, but at the same time, they have the same basic problems,\u201d explains Pag\u00e9-Perron. \u201cUnderstanding Mesopotamia is a way of understanding what it means to be human.\u201d\n\nShe hopes machine analysis will also clarify certain features of Sumerian that still puzzle modern academics. This extinct language is not related to any modern language but has been preserved in inscriptions written in cuneiform. It may be our last remaining link to even older, unrecorded societies.\n\n\u201cSumerian is probably the last member of what must have been a large family of languages that goes back thousands and thousands of years,\u201d says Irving Finkel, the curator in charge of the 130,000 cuneiform tablets stored at the British Museum. \u201cWriting appeared in the world just in time to rescue Sumerian\u2026 We\u2019re just lucky that we had some \u2018microphone\u2019 that picked it up before it went away with all the others.\u201d\n\nFinkel is one of the world\u2019s leading cuneiform experts. In his book-filled office at the British Museum, he explains how the script was slowly deciphered thanks to a multi-lingual inscription about a king, just like the Rosetta Stone that helped researchers make sense of Egyptian hieroglyphs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually rather astonishing how interesting it is when you find a human mind across millennia, where it is like talking to them on the telephone,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the most exciting thing in the world when you meet one of these people.\u201d\n\nAncient access\n\nFew of us will ever cradle a 5,000-year-old tablet in our palm. But thanks to advanced imaging techniques, anyone with an internet connection can now access treasures such as the world\u2019s oldest surviving royal library, which is being digitised. It was built in Nineveh by Ashurbanipal, a powerful and book-loving Assyrian king. Some of the surviving tablets from his library are displayed at the British Museum as part of a special exhibition on Ashurbanipal. Although blackened and hardened by fire when Nineveh was sacked in 612 BC, the text they carry can still be read.\n\nNew imaging techniques are making the job of working with such ancient, often damaged texts easier. With highly detailed images, it is possible to pick out marks that may be too obscure to see with a human eye.\n\nDahl and his colleagues have been digitising tablets and seals stored in collections in Teheran, Paris and Oxford for a project known as the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative. This vast online database already contains about a third of the world\u2019s cuneiform texts, as well as some undeciphered written languages, such as Proto-Elamite from ancient Iran. Without sprawling digital resources like this, training machines to do translation would not even be possible.\n\nDigitisation is also helping researchers to piece together links between texts scattered in collections around the world. Dahl, along with researchers at the University of Southampton and the University of Paris-Nanterre, has digitised 3D images of about 2,000 stone seals from Mesopotamia. In a pilot project, they then used AI algorithms to examine a group of six tablets and identify matching seal impressions found elsewhere in the world. The algorithm correctly selected a tablet that is currently stored in Italy, and another that is stored in the United States; both had been stamped by the same seal.\n\nMatching seals and impressions has been notoriously difficult in the past, as many are stored thousands of miles apart. Dahl estimates that all seals could be digitised within about five years, which would then make it possible to trace other patterns. There is some indication, for example, that certain types of stone were favoured by women.\n\n\u201cThat is the kind of question you could not answer unless you had large numbers of seals imaged in the way we\u2019re doing, and applying techniques like algorithms or machine learning,\u201d Dahl says. He hopes that as artificial intelligence evolves, it will help us unravel the full potential of the rich information contained in collections around the world.\n\n\u201cI want Assyriology, which covers half of human history and a very endangered cultural heritage, to be at the forefront of this.\u201d\n\nCracking codes\n\nImaging is also changing research into undeciphered scripts. Humans tend to be better than machines at this type of decipherment, which typically involves small amounts of text, creative mental leaps, and an understanding of how people lived and organised themselves. It also involves a great deal of intellectual flexibility.\n\nEarly cuneiform signs, for example, were not even arranged in a linear text, but simply placed together with a box drawn around them. Proto-Elamite is three-dimensional: a shallow impression of a circle has a different meaning than a deeper one. However, technology has helped the decipherment process by providing detailed pictures that can be magnified, shared and compared.\n\n\u201cThe crucial problem is first and foremost to get proper images,\u201d says Dahl, who is working on deciphering the mysterious script. \u201cThat\u2019s lacking for the first 100 years of study of Proto-Elamite.\u201d\n\nSuch advances go beyond the field of Assyriology. Philippa Steele, a senior research fellow at Cambridge University, is an expert in the early writing systems of ancient Crete and Greece. These include \u2018Linear A\u2019, an undeciphered script, and \u2018Linear B\u2019, which was used to write an ancient form of Greek.\n\nThanks to techniques that take sophisticated images of ancient tablets that feature these scripts, Steele has discovered new details.\n\n\u201cYou can make out features that are very difficult to make out with the naked eye,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd often those features might correspond to the ways in which the person writing the document interacted with the document. So for Linear B, for example\u2026 you can make out erasures. Sometimes you can tell when the person writing the document has worked something out and then written something over the top.\u201d\n\nPag\u00e9-Perron hopes that machines will eventually be able to translate more complex Sumerian tablets, and other languages like Akkadian. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to discover about ancient cultures,\u201d she says.\n\nPerhaps one day, we will be able to read all of our earliest texts in translation \u2013 though many of Mesopotamia\u2019s riddles are likely to outlive us, not least because many missing cuneiform fragments are still in the ground, waiting to be excavated.\n\nThe kings of ancient Mesopotamia thought deeply about the past and the future. They revered cuneiform texts from previous eras, and buried special inscriptions recording their names and achievements, promising rewards for a later ruler who would honour them.\n\nIn some ways their wish came true. Their battles and conquests may be forgotten by most. But their most powerful invention, writing, has helped humanity develop ideas and technologies over millennia \u2013 and now, train machines to learn from the past.\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

It says the ban reduces unwanted animals being dumped back after the holiday period.\n\n\"Animals are living beings with needs and feelings,\" it said. \"They are not suitable as surprise gifts.\"\n\nIn Bremen, none of 500 animals will be re-homed after 18 December.\n\nRegional news outlets are reporting similar decisions in other towns and cities, including dozens of shelters in a united decision in Lower Saxony.\n\nThe problem, according to the ban's supporters, is that pets are often bought impulsively at the last minute.\n\n\"The decision to keep an animal must not be taken lightly - the whole family must be involved in the decision-making process,\" said Claudia H\u00e4mmerling from Berlin's animal protection association.\n\nMost shelters will still be open for viewings - but families will have to come back in January after they've had time to consider.\n\nNot everyone agrees with an outright ban.\n\nIn the UK, animal protection group RSPCA says the person receiving the pet should be known to be willing and ready - and highlights the extra noise, hustle and bustle at Christmas that \"can make it difficult for any pet to settle into their new homes\".\n\n\"However, for some people, the festive period is a calm, quiet time and may well be a good opportunity to introduce an animal into the home as families tend to be around the house with more time to spend with them,\" it says.\n\nTheir US counterpart, the ASPCA, largely agrees.\n\nBut the Dogs Trust - author of the famous slogan about dogs being \"not just for Christmas\" - is still running adverts to that effect nearly 40 years after it first coined the phrase.\n\n\"Christmas presents aren't dogs, and dogs aren't Christmas presents. It's that simple!\" the charity said when launching this year's advert."

    "text": "In my Don't Tell Me the Score podcast, Sherylle Calder tells me she has no doubt that smartphone usage is having a really serious effect, including on top international athletes.\n\n\"We see that in elite sports there's a decline in skills. We notice players get off the training field and the first thing they do is go on their phones. We weren't designed to do that. They're multitasking by reading stuff and going from Twitter to Facebook. They have deteriorating memory, spatial awareness and attention span,\u201d she says.\n\nIf you're using a smartphone, you are being distracted between 2000 and 4000 times a day. Sherylle Calder\n\nSo if phone use is having that effect on professional rugby players, what about the rest of us? A recent report by OFCOM claimed that people spend nearly three hours a day on their phones, and four hours for those aged 15-24.\n\n\"We are training ourselves to be distracted. We've done work in big banks where the productivity is declining, because people are being distracted all the time,\u201d says Dr Calder.\n\n\u201cIf you're using a smartphone, you are being distracted between 2000 and 4000 times a day. Twenty years ago, no one was doing that, so we're having information overload. We call it digital cocaine. It's frightening.\"\n\nAs the OFCOM statistics suggest, young people spend even more time scrolling on their phones. Sherylle Calder works in schools where she says she notices reading and comprehension skills are in decline. For children in particular, time used for scrolling would be far better spent outside, developing motor skills and \u201ceye-hand coordination\u201d, as she calls it."

    "text": "There can only be one winner and IDLES' record is a worthy one at that. The Bristol band's second album (and second record to make a 6 Music Albums of the Year list), Joy As An Act Of Resistance takes all the rage, passion, joy and dark humour that often defines our modern times and sends it screaming back with 12 ferociously beautiful tracks.\n\nIt's a really powerful record, articulate but quite acerbic... with understanding and wit, fury and frustration Steve Lamacq\n\nWhile IDLES' debut, 2017's Brutalism, centred around the death of singer Joe Talbot\u2019s mother, Joy As An Act of Resistance finds the frontman confronting another heartbreaking trauma \u2013 the stillbirth of his daughter. At times, it certainly sounds like a catharsis. \"When you're sharing, channels do get opened and this album is about keeping those channels open and getting a result out of it,\" guitarist Mark Bowen explains.\n\nThe result is a raw and visceral record that still manages to be witty and profound, somehow finding a way to shine a positive light on the whole gamut of life. \"Joy as an Act of Resistance is a parade,\" Talbot wrote in a press release announcing the record. \"It is the parade of being carried through the grim dark. It is a parade of laughing at yourself. It is love. It is loving yourself.\"\n\nThe album's highlight is Danny Nedelko, named after a Ukrainian friend of the band and showing solidarity with the country's immigrant population. The track manages to reference both Pavement and Yoda and, like the album as a whole, is a real masterpiece.\n\nSteve Lamacq: \"To me, the IDLES album is what I want to remember from 2018. Not the general sense of malaise, the backbiting and the uncertainty that's characterised part of the year; that general sense of gloom. I don't want that from 2018. I want to come away with this more optimistic sense of love and community... It's a really powerful record, articulate but quite acerbic... [with] understanding and wit, fury and frustration. It's got so many things in it, but it's almost like they've taken all the darkness, turned it upside down and come out with this record that touches on so many things... It says to people, 'look, if you love yourself then it's a lot easier to make sense of the world and to love other people'. As a manifesto, that suggests that in this case at least, resistance maybe isn't futile.\"\n\nIDLES: \"Being included in the list is obviously humbling but more so the recognition from an institution that represents a huge portion of what we love in music: hard work and vibrancy towards new ideas and creative thinking. Thank you to all at 6 Music for helping us build our careers and our faith in the music industry.\""

Do you tell them or do you let it slide? What if they're someone who still doesn't get it right after several months and several corrections? Do you now need to change your name by deed poll?\n\nImage copyright Nana Saeed Marfo Image caption Nana Marfo's nickname was not his preferred choice but one bestowed upon him by colleagues\n\nI'm clearly not the only one who's facing challenges.\n\nWhen Nana Marfo worked in the civil service, he unwillingly became the subject of an informal name change. He said he already stood out as he has a tracheostomy and while some colleagues were able to call him by the right name, others called him \"Nandos\". He tried to correct the misnomer for three years.\n\n\"But one day a client came to our department and started calling me 'Nandos'. When I asked why he called me that, he said that's how my colleague had pronounced my name on the initial visit. At that point I was beyond the point of trying to correct people, and since then have been nicknamed 'Nandos',\" he says.\n\nNana felt he had to let it go. \"I didn't feel this situation was something higher management could correct.\"\n\nSay my name, say my name\n\nEmails are also dangerous territory.\n\nNefra Germain used to work in the corporate world. She said people would continually get her first name and surname mixed up in emails despite the fact she would sign off with her given name.\n\n\"It's like people's brains can't process a name that is unusual so they have to find a way to normalise it and even correct you,\" she says.\n\nSo how should you deal with these professional mishaps?\n\nBinna Kandola is an author and business psychologist who's had his own fair share of mix-ups. \"I was speaking recently at a conference in Las Vegas and the person who introduced me called me Pina Colada.\n\n\"I got up and said: 'My name's Binna Kandola. Pina Colada's my father.' I like to think it made a point to the guy who introduced me. Sometimes humour is the best approach.\"\n\nImage copyright Binna Kandola Image caption Binna Kandola has been called a variety of names, including Benji, Fred and Mr Tandoori\n\nHe suggests that the minute someone gets your name wrong, correct them straight away and also get teammates to reinforce and support you when in meetings by saying your name correctly each time it is mispronounced.\n\nHe also says that one-off mistakes should be apologised for, corrections made and everyone should attempt to move on.\n\nR-E-S-P-E-C-T\n\nSorrel Shalet is the head of people at Smart Energy GB. \"When I introduce myself I often get 'that's OK' as a response. They think I've said that 'I'm sorry'.\n\n\"Usually it doesn't bother me too much, but sometimes I tell the person, to help pronounce it correctly, 'My name rhymes with coral.' Using a familiar rhyming word usually does the trick.\n\n\"If someone keeps getting your name wrong in the workplace, I would speak to them about it. It's likely they haven't realised their mistake.\"\n\nAnd although Nana didn't feel comfortable doing so, Sorrel adds that you could also \"ask your manager or someone from the HR team to raise it informally with them on your behalf\".\n\nImage copyright Montserrat Peidro-Insa Image caption Montserrat Peidro-Insa's name has been transmogrified into \"Monster Rat\" on occasion\n\nMontserrat Peidro-Insa's name may be common in Catalonia but that hasn't stopped her from being called some peculiar aberrations. \"The worst example of that confusion was when a customer in the US thought my name was Monster Rat. He still calls me that without even blinking.\n\n\"For some reason Japanese people have no issue with my name. I must admit the funniest ones always come from English-speaking nationalities, especially Americans and Brits.\"\n\nThat's certainly my experience too. What's also frustrating is it's often British or American people who get my name wrong or will mix me up with other Asian women in the office.\n\nAs well as being annoying, a recent poll by The Guardian investigating racial bias in the UK suggested that 57% of people from an ethnic minority background felt they had to work harder to succeed in Britain because of their ethnicity, while various global studies reveal that some ethnic minorities have had to \"whiten\" their CVs, using techniques such as anglicising their names, in a bid to succeed.\n\nThe direct approach\n\nWhether your name is easy to pronounce or not, or not particularly unusual in your country, it seems everyone has a story of being called the wrong name at some point.\n\nBut how do you reclaim your name, when, let's face it, it could lead to mortal embarrassment?\n\nImage copyright Simon Hewett Image caption After Simon Hewett told a colleague she got his name wrong, she avoided him\n\nToronto-based Simon Hewett went for the direct approach. \"I had a colleague call me Steve for five years. One day I got in the elevator and it was just the two of us. She said, 'Morning Steve' and I just looked around.\n\n\"I then said, 'You know my name is Simon right?' She looked stunned, laughed it off and got off at the next floor. She proceeded to avoid me after that.\"\n\nPractical solutions\n\nCorrect someone the moment they get your name wrong\n\nGet teammates to reinforce and support you when in meetings by saying your name correctly\n\nAsk people how their name should be pronounced - let them guide you\n\nApologise when you get it wrong\n\nBinna Kandola admits it's not an easy subject to broach.\n\n\"People think [this naming issue] is trivial. If you complain about it, people think the problem is you - that you don't have a sense of humour... you are seen as a troublemaker.\"\n\nBut he says when people consistently get your name wrong, they are \"robbing you of a key part of your identity\".\n\n\"That's them saying to you that you don't matter in my world and I can't even be bothered to give you the attention to spell your name right.\"\n\nHe says that how organisations deal with such situations shows what the culture of that organisation is like. \"People need to understand the impact these issues have.

What is the Geminid Meteor Shower?\n\nOne of the most dazzling meteor showers of the year is lighting up the sky this week.\n\nThe Geminid shooting stars are due to peak in the second week of December - on the night of 13 (going into 14) December.\n\nWhat is the Geminid meteor shower?\n\nAFP A meteor from the Geminids meteor shower enters the Earth's atmosphere\n\nMeteors are small space rocks ranging from the size of a grain of sand to a pea that enter the Earth's atmosphere and burn up, producing a bright streak of light.\n\nMost meteors break off from comets, which are dirty \"snowballs\" mainly made of ice, but the Geminids are different.\n\nThe object they come from - the 3200 Phaethon - is more like an asteroid.\n\nTo enjoy the CBBC Newsround website at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on.

If you're in a big city, the light from the city will likely dazzle them too much so you probably won't be able to see the Geminids if you're here.\n\nGive your eyes enough time to adjust to the dark and don't look at your phone, as the brightness from it will affect how your eyes have adjusted to the dark.\n\nThen, look up! Maybe even lie on your back so you can see as much of the sky as possible.\n\nHopefully, with clear skies, you will be able to spot them as they blaze across the night sky.\n\nIf you're really lucky on 16 December, you might even spot a small, ghostly green patch in the constellation of Taurus, if you manage to find where that is.

    "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Some memorable moments from David Dimbleby's tenure as Question Time host\n\nAfter 25 years, David Dimbleby's tenure on BBC One's Question Time is coming to an end.\n\nThe presenter is stepping down from the flagship political debate show, with Fiona Bruce poised to replace him.\n\n\"It has been exhilarating following the twists and turns of British politics,\" he has said.\n\nTwists and turns is putting it mildly. His time on the show has covered the Iraq War, the 2008 financial crisis and the EU referendum.\n\nIt has also seen the fall of John Major, the rise of Tony Blair and the Tory-Liberal Democrat coalition.\n\nFrom the growth of social media to the spread of populism, the Dimbleby era has seen the character of political debate change as well - something often reflected in the shifting nature of Question Time itself.\n\n\"I think David was one of the first of a generation who did start challenging the politicians and the people who were on [the programme],\" veteran Tory Kenneth Clarke said on a recent 5 Live podcast.\n\n\"He made a great thing about audience reaction and giving them more space.\"\n\nLabour's shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, also shared her experiences of the host, saying a panellist could never be sure about how Dimbleby would react during a debate.\n\n\"You arrive and he comes up and he is all twinkly and you're thinking 'Yeah, yeah, which David have we got tonight?' - because you don't know what's going to happen.\"\n\nNo stranger to controversy\n\nUncertainty has long been an appeal of debate, and Dimbleby has spent more than two decades finding order in the show's weekly mix of politicians and celebrities.\n\nThat mix has not been without its controversies. In 2009 the BBC made the choice to invite then-BNP leader Nick Griffin to be a panellist.\n\nIt was the first time the far-right party had been represented on the programme, and the choice led to a national debate on the BBC's interests and obligations.\n\nIt also led to wider questions about how extremist politicians should be treated by the media, foreshadowing more recent arguments around populism, extremism and 'no platforming'.\n\nImage caption Nick Griffin's appearance was watched by more than eight million people\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Front Row programme at the time, Dimbleby said he had wanted to \"expose\" the BNP leader to an audience.\n\n\"The idea of exposing the BNP or, to put it more objectively or disinterestedly, allowing the BNP to face an audience and face questions from them seemed to me to be the right thing to do - as long as they were a substantial political party or a party big enough to be included.\"\n\nExposure was certainly what Mr Griffin faced. The episode was watched by more than eight million people, the highest audience since Question Time began broadcasting in 1979.\n\nFuelling social media\n\nPolitical controversy might have had its part in fuelling such large viewing figures. But another possible factor is something that has only continued to grow since 2009: social media.\n\nDimbleby's tenure on Question Time has seen the likes of Twitter and Facebook enter the cultural landscape. In an age of hashtags and instantaneous commentary, the programme has thrived.\n\nStatements and questions can be quoted, parodied and turned into memes long before a panellist has stopped speaking. The term \"gammon\" first emerged as a pejorative by online viewers of Question Time in 2016.\n\n(The term refers, as the journalist Adam Bienkov put it, to \"an angry old man with pink cheeks\" and was not directed at Dimbleby himself.)\n\nDimbleby has been lampooned by the Dimblebot Twitter account, which posts 'all-caps' commentary on the debates and pretty much everything else related to the presenter.\n\nAt the same time, social media also means panellists have become susceptible to attacks that extend far beyond the rows of a studio audience.\n\nDuring one episode, Dimbleby told an audience that online comments levelled against Institute of Economic Affairs associate director Kate Andrews ahead of the debate were \"vile, disgusting, loathsome remarks by people hiding under the cloak of anonymity.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dimbleby criticises 'vile' social media attacks on Question Time panellist\n\nA Roman theatre\n\nWhile Question Time's audience may have extended online, the most memorable moments from Dimbleby's time on the show have involved members of the public in the studio.\n\n\"The thing about the audience is that, over time, they've realised that they are just as big a part of the show as anyone else,\" said Ms Thornberry. \"It's like a Roman theatre sometimes.\"\n\nAs presenter, Dimbleby often found himself stealing the limelight. In the midst of the MPs' expenses scandal in 2009, Eric Pickles, the former chairman of the Conservative Party, agreed to appear on Question Time.\n\nThings did not go well for him. When asked about how many houses he owned, Mr Pickles admitted to having two - prompting pantomime boos from the audience.\n\nHe then attempted to defend himself, arguing he needed a property close to the House of Commons to make sure he was there on time for meetings.\n\n\"Like a job in other words,\" quipped Dimbleby.\n\nA degree of theatrics might be embraced, but the line is towed at outright heckling.\n\nWhen a particularly rowdy audience member would not stop interrupting businesswoman and activist Gina Miller in 2017, the presenter firmly told him \"he ought to leave\". The man did.\n\nIt was the Question Time equivalent of a pub brawl.\n\nAt turns sharp and sympathetic, Dimbleby's approach has been at the heart of Question Time for a generation. \"He made this programme the David Dimbleby show,\" said Mr Clarke.\n\nThe programme will soon be headed up by Fiona Bruce, who said she was \"thrilled and not a little daunted\" to be taking over from \"one of her television heroes\".\n\nHow will the flagship politics programme change under its new leader? The ongoing drama around Brexit means Ms Bruce will hit the ground running, but the show has deeper concerns to contend with.\n\nThe whole concept of public debate is different now to 25 years ago. The meme-generating, Roman theatre format might have proven successful in the past, but how will it fare over the next quarter of a century? And what shape will it take in an age of viral panics and anti-expert sentiments?\n\nPerhaps it just needs to keep people watching.\n\n\"At a time when ratings for many scheduled TV programmes are under strain, just maintaining the show's current audience and editorial integrity, while reflecting a changing country and occasionally creating real news, may well count as success,\" commented BBC media editor Amol Rajan.\n\nAs for Dimbleby himself, he has said he is \"not giving up broadcasting\" and that he intends to return to his \"first love: reporting\".\n\nWe have not seen the last of the man with the scorpion tattoo.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Dom and his wife Sharon were organising their wedding on a shoestring and had asked Donald to take the photos. Initially he was busy, but just three weeks before the big day, Donald said he could after all \u2013 if they wouldn\u2019t mind him sneaking in some extra shots.\n\nThe concept behind the artwork for Different Class was that cardboard cut-outs of the band's members would feature in different real-life situations. After the real wedding photos had been taken, Dom, Sharon and their guests posed alongside the cardboard versions of Jarvis, Candida, Russell, Nick and Steve. And that was the last they heard of it, until his mum called him up, having seen the album in HMV in Middlesbrough.\n\n\"It's a really nice cool thing, so we're happy to have the memory,\" Dom told Chris.

    "text": "Image copyright Keely Favell / Hook News\n\nA woman lost a third of her bodyweight after surgery to remove a 26kg ovarian cyst - the weight of seven newborn babies.\n\nDespite multiple negative pregnancy tests, doctors insisted Keely Favell must be pregnant as her stomach grew in size.\n\nWhen asked questions about baby due dates, she spared people's embarrassment by playing along.\n\nBut the 28-year-old believed herself to be \"just fat\".\n\nMs Favell, from Swansea, started gaining weight in 2014.\n\n\"I've always been chunky, but over the course of a couple of years, I gradually got this tummy,\" she said.\n\nImage copyright Keely Favell / Hook News\n\n\"It crept up so slowly that I didn't know anything was wrong - I just thought I was putting on timber.\n\n\"I've been with my partner Jamie Gibbins for 10 years and we did wonder a few times if I was pregnant - but we did home tests and they always ruled it out.\"\n\nShe said it was \"so embarrassing\" explaining she was not pregnant: \"I'd go along with it to spare everyone the blushes.\"\n\nAfter blacking out in her office admin job, Ms Favell plucked up the courage to see a GP in 2016, who said she must be pregnant despite blood negative tests.\n\n\"Looking at me, anyone would have thought I was nine months gone.\n\nWhat is an ovarian cyst?\n\nIt is a fluid-filled sac that develops on a woman's ovary. They are very common and do not usually cause any symptoms\n\nMost ovarian cysts occur naturally and disappear in a few months without needing any treatment\n\nCysts may affect both ovaries at the same time, or they may only affect one\n\nThey only causes symptoms if it splits (ruptures), is very large, or blocks the blood supply to the ovaries\n\nSome of the symptoms can include pelvic pain, pain during sex, needing to go to the toilet regularly, bloating and swollen stomach\n\n\"It wasn't the first time I'd been mistaken for an expectant mum... People had seen me waddling around, carrying this lump, and I'd been asked a few times when I was due.\"\n\nStill believing Ms Favell to be pregnant, her GP referred her for an ultrasound scan in January last year.\n\n\"I was lying there with Jamie beside me as the radiologist moved the probe over my tummy. I saw her eyes widen in horror, but the screen was just blank.\n\n\"The look on her face said it all - something was wrong, and when she said she had to get a consultant I started to panic. Jamie did his best to reassure me but I felt paralysed with fear.\"\n\nShe was sent for an emergency CT scan which revealed a cyst surrounded by fluid.\n\n\"[The consultant] told me I wasn't fat all - I was actually quite thin.\"\n\nMs Favell was referred to a high-risk obstetrics consultant and examined in February last year.\n\nImage copyright Keely Favell / Hook News Image caption Keely Favell and her partner of 10 years Jamie Gibbins\n\n\"By this time, even walking was a struggle and I had difficulty breathing.\n\n\"I'll never forget the look of shock on his face when the consultant examined me. He said I had a large ovarian mass and the only option was surgery. He couldn't say what it was, exactly, or how big.\"\n\nThe cyst was finally removed in March last year, and was revealed to be 26kg the weight of a seven or eight-year-old child - or seven average-sized newborn babies.\n\n\"They explained how big this cyst was and showed me the pictures - I couldn't believe I'd been walking around for so long carrying this medical alien.\n\n\"It looked like a massive pile of ice cream so I called it Mr Whippy.\"\n\nMs Favell has been left with a large scar and stretch marks, but will still be able to have children.\n\n\"I lost sight of how difficult even simple things like driving a car or walking up the stairs had become. Losing my lump gave me my life back - I can't thank my surgeon enough.\"\n\nImage copyright Keely Favell / Hook News Image caption \"I wasn't fat at all\" - Keely Favell pictured after surgery to remove the cyst\n\nYou may also be interested in:"

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nTwo nuns who worked at a Catholic school in California have admitted embezzling about $500,000 (\u00a3396,000) and using it to gamble in Las Vegas.\n\nSisters Mary Kreuper and Lana Chang took the money from St James' Catholic School in the city of Torrance, near Los Angeles, to spend in casinos.\n\nThe pair, who are said to be best friends, took funds from an account holding tuition fees and donations.\n\nThe sisters, who recently retired, have expressed remorse for their actions.\n\nMary Kreuper was the school principal for 29 years, while Lana Chang worked as a teacher for about 20 years. They are thought to have stolen the money over a period of at least a decade to spend on travel and gambling.\n\nOn Monday, St James' Catholic Church said the nuns had expressed \"deep remorse\" over their actions, adding that while the police had been informed, no criminal charges would be brought against the pair.\n\n\"The Sisters have confirmed the misappropriation of funds and have co-operated in the investigation,\" the sisters' order, the Sisters of St Joseph of Carondelet, said in a statement on its website.\n\n\"Our community is concerned and saddened by this situation and regret any injury to our long relationship with the families of the school,\" it added.\n\nThe priest of the church, Monsignor Michael Meyers, wrote in a letter to parishioners: \"Sister Mary Margaret and Sister Lana have expressed to me and asked that I convey to you, the deep remorse they each feel for their actions and ask for your forgiveness and prayers.\"\n\nThe Archdiocese of Los Angeles said the church discovered that the money was missing during a routine audit.\n\nThe nuns were allegedly able to conceal their actions by depositing a number of cheques made out to the school for tuition and other fees into a separate bank account not used by the school.\n\nParents were reportedly informed about the findings earlier this month.\n\nYou might also like:"

    "title": "Six reasons your memory is stranger than you think",
    "authors": [
      "David Robson"
    ],
    "text": "1) It is impossible to recall your first few years\u2026 but many believe they can\n\n\n\n\u201cI presume that my readers do not at all remember, or remember only very vaguely, that highly important period of their existence which anteceded their birth and which transpired in their mother\u2019s womb,\u201d wrote Salvador Dali in his memoir. \u201cBut I, yes, I remember this period, as though it were only yesterday.\u201d He hoped that his own recollections of that \u201cdivine paradise\u201d would help others retrieve those lost moments of life before birth.\n\nIn reality, Dali\u2019s recollections were almost certainly the result of his considerable imagination. Scientists today believe that it is impossible to recall the first few years of life \u2013 and the time before birth must also be a complete blank. Many of the necessary brain structures for memory have not yet matured at the time, meaning that it is physiologically impossible for it to retain personal events from early infancy into adulthood. Instead, any recollections of that time are illusory or \u201cfalse memories\u201d \u2013 patched together from other experiences or knowledge that we acquired later in life.\n\nWatch the video below to hear Julia Shaw, a psychologist at University College London and author of The Memory Illusion, explain this process.\n\nThis media cannot be played on your device.\n\n2) Your memory can depend on your temperature\n\nPsychologists say that human memory is \u2018context-dependent\u2019. To understand what that means, consider an experiment that asked some participants to stick their hands in a bucket of ice water \u2013 a considerably uncomfortable experience \u2013 and then memorise a list of words. Later on, after some testing, the researchers found that the participants\u2019 memory improved if they stuck their hand in another ice bath.\n\nThe study showed that we remember facts better if we recreate subtle environmental or physiological cues from the time when memories are initially encoding, even if they appear to be irrelevant.\n\nThis is one reason why the events of a drunken night out are easier to remember when we have a few beers, but difficult to recall when we are sober. As Shaw points out in The Memory Illusion, you might try to use these physiological cues to your advantage. People who chew gum or drink coffee while studying will remember more if they do the same thing around the time of the test. Smells can also be evocative: so try to wear a particular perfume or aftershave that you associate with your exam revision.\n\n3) Your mental timeline is warped\n\nTake a moment to guess the month and year when the following events occurred:\n\n(a) Michael Jackson\u2019s death\n\n(b) The release of Beyonc\u00e9's album Lemonade\n\n(c) The infamous Oscar\u2019s mix-up, when La La Land was erroneously awarded the Best Picture award\n\n(d) Angela Merkel's announcement that she would step down as German Chancellor in 2021\n\nUnless you are unusually attuned to the news cycle, however, your answers were probably way off the mark, and they may have followed a recognisable pattern. Research has shown that we often underestimate the amount of time that has passed since distant events (such as Michael Jackson\u2019s death) and over-estimate the amount of time that has passed since more recent events (like Angela Merkel's announcement). This phenomenon is known as \u201ctemporal displacement\u201d or \u201ctelescoping\u201d; your mental timeline is warped and does not correspond to actual chronology.\n\nThe real dates are (a) June 2009 (b) April 2016 (c) February 2017 and (d) October 2018.\n\n(4) There is a benefit to vague memories\u2026\n\nTry to draw a picture of your best friend from memory. Or, without looking at a photo, describe them in as much detail as you possibly can. Unless you have face blindness, you\u2019ll probably be able to give a good account of their general features, only to find that specific features \u2013 even something as fundamental as the colour of their eyes \u2013 is hard to pin down.\n\nThis is one example of how we tend to remember the gist of things rather than the fine details. This isn\u2019t necessarily a disadvantage. The fine details of a face, say, often change from day to day, but the overall impression or gist will stay the same \u2013 meaning you can still recognise your friend in different lighting or with a different hairstyle. (Incidentally, even our memory of our own appearance is not very accurate, and we tend to remember our faces to be more attractive than they really are.)\n\n(5) \u2026 but your overconfidence in your memory\u2019s accuracy has a financial cost\n\nIf you were to make an attempt to draw or describe your face, you probably believe that you\u2019ll remember a lot more than you actually do. Many studies have shown that the majority of people believe their memory is better than average \u2013 when, of course, this would be a statistical impossibility.\n\nWe seem to dismiss, and then forget, the times our memory has failed us, and preferentially recall all the times it succeeded \u2013 and so the next time we need to judge its accuracy, we assume it is going to be spot on. That\u2019s a serious problem for police officers, for example, whose belief in the accuracy of their recall may have a bearing on a criminal case, and it can also be the downfall of many students, who optimistically overestimate the amount they have learnt.\n\nWe are also overconfident of our \u2018prospective memory\u2019 \u2013 the capacity to remember to do things in the future. And that can have a financial cost. As Shaw points out, subscription services can take advantage of this fact, by offering a free trial for a limited period, after which automatic payments will be taken from your account. Thanks to the overconfidence in their prospective memory, many people forget to cancel the subscription by the time the free trial ends.\n\n(6) You may suffer from digital amnesia\n\nThe ubiquity of smart phones could be a huge boon for our memory. Just think of all the events stored in your Facebook and Instagram posts \u2013 giving a huge archive of prompts to aid our reminiscence. But social media also has the potential to distort our recall of past events. One reason is a phenomenon known as \u2018retrieval-induced forgetting\u2019. It is now well known that memories become \u2018labile\u2019 and \u2018fragile\u2019 when we pull them into our consciousness \u2013 and it also exposes related memories to distortion, too. As a result, recalling one element of an event may strengthen our memory for that detail, but often leads us to forget related information that is not actively recalled.\n\nIt is easy to see how this could play out on social media. A Facebook prompt that draws your attention to a particular photo of a wedding, say, may therefore lead you to forget other aspects of the day. This is particularly problematic, given that our social media feeds have already been cultivated and curated to present an unrealistic view of ourselves.\n\n\u201cBy having social media dictate which experiences count as the most meaningful in our lives, it is potentially culling the memories that are considered less shareable,\u201d Shaw writes. \u201cSimultaneously it is reinforcing the memories collectively chosen as the most likeable, potentially making some memories seem more meaningful and memorable than they originally were.\u201d\n\nDavid Robson is a senior journalist at BBC Future.

    "authors": [
      "Tom Cassauwers"
    ],
    "text": "The sun has cooled down and Earth has become uninhabitable. Only one solution remains for humanity: flee beyond the solar system. This is the premise for The Wandering Earth, and the movie could easily be a Hollywood blockbuster. The trailer even has Inception-esque foghorns. Yet this isn\u2019t a US movie with an all-white cast, it\u2019s the Chinese adaptation of a science fiction book of the same name by star writer Cixin Liu. It\u2019s the Chinese who are saving humanity here, not the Americans.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- Why Children of Men has never been as shocking as it is now\n\n- Would sex with a robot be infidelity?\n\n- Why The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is so relevant today\n\nWell-known artistic depictions of the future have traditionally been regarded as the preserve of the West, and have shown a marked lack of diversity. Yet new regions and authors are depicting the future from their perspectives. Chinese science fiction has boomed in recent years, with stand-out books like Cixin Liu\u2019s The Three-Body Problem. And Afrofuturism is on the rise since the release of the blockbuster Black Panther. Around the world, science fiction is blossoming.\n\n\u201cScience fiction is now a global phenomenon,\u201d says Mingwei Song, Associate Professor at Wellesley College, specialising in Chinese sci-fi and literature. \u201cThis has been one of the most remarkable developments of the genre because it transcends this Western and particularly Anglo-American domination of the genre.\u201d\n\nAnd the new movement is wide-ranging, including everything from Russian science fiction \u2013 with a history reaching back into the 19th Century \u2013 to Afrofuturism, a movement rooted in experiences of black oppression. It covers Chinese books dealing with revolutionary history and aliens, to futurist Mexican movies about migration and free trade.\n\n\u201cRight now the most interesting science fiction is produced in all sorts of non-traditional places,\u201d says Anindita Banerjee, Associate Professor at Cornell University, whose research focuses on global sci-fi. \u201cBut this phenomenon, which is now making its voice heard from areas like China or Africa, also has a much longer history that precedes today\u2019s boom.\u201d\n\nSubversive fiction\n\n\n\nCurrently, Chinese science fiction is becoming increasingly popular in the West, thanks to English translations of writers like Cixin Liu and Hao Jingfang. Nevertheless, there was a long history of sci-fi preceding them.\n\nThe genre went through three waves in the country: one after the fall of Imperial China in 1902; one after the Chinese revolution in 1949; and the current \u2018new wave\u2019 which started in the 1990s, when the country pushed forward in its rapid pattern of development. \u201cIn the 1990s a new generation of writers began to emerge, and among this generation, Liu Cixin is the most important author,\u201d says Mingwei.\n\nFirst released in 2006, Cixin\u2019s The Three-Body Problem is credited with pushing Chinese science fiction into the mainstream. In 2014 it was translated into English and a year later it won a Hugo Award, the Oscars of science fiction. The story deals with an astrophysicist who gets involved with secret government research during the Cultural Revolution, inadvertently inviting aliens to earth.\n\nChinese science fiction is seen as a reflection on the narrative of a rising and rapidly modernising China, which is also becoming increasingly prevalent in the West. But the genre also deals with repression of free speech, often showing dark, unseen sides of reality. In the case of Cixin Liu, this often means parallel realities and challenging physics. But, in turn, the book Folding Beijing by Hao Jingfang shows a tightly hierarchical future Beijing in which the Earth spins around to give three social classes variable amounts of Sun.\n\n\u201cThis new wave of science fiction has a dark and subversive side that speaks either to the invisible dimensions of reality, or simply the impossibility of representing a reality dictated by the discourse of a national dream,\u201d says Mingwei.\n\nThe Three-Body Problem and Chinese science fiction in general often feature controversial subjects. The opening scene of The Three-Body Problem, for example, depicts the lead character\u2019s father being lynched in a collective struggle session at the height of the Cultural Revolution.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always amazed by the continued prosperity of the genre,\u201d says Mingwei. \u201cSome of it is very subversive and provocative. But so far they haven\u2019t been censored. My theory for why it continues to grow is that it isn\u2019t protest literature. It\u2019s a literary genre that uses the imagination to explore unseen realities. But it doesn\u2019t directly challenge the Chinese government.\u201d And these unseen realities are key. \u201cScience fiction depicts the invisible part of Chinese reality that is hidden behind the glorious image of China on the rise,\u201d he says.\n\nMaking the invisible visible\n\nAnother artform looking at unseen realities is Afrofuturism. \u201cIf you look at depictions of the future, from Blade Runner to The Jetsons, the future is often very white, and people of colour are often missing,\u201d says Susana Morris, Associate Professor at Georgia Institute of Technology specialising in Afrofuturism. \u201cAfrofuturism re-imagines what a futurist landscape would look like with blacks at the centre.\u201d\n\nAfrofuturism reaches back to when W E B Du Bois wrote his 1920 short story The Comet, in which the entire human population is killed, except for a black man and a white woman. The best-known example of Afrofuturism is 2018 superhero movie Black Panther, depicting Wakanda, a non-colonised African country that has been able to develop on its own terms, and which owns the world\u2019s most powerful resource: Vibranium. This background provides the canvas on which a futurist, black society is depicted in the movie and the accompanying comic books written by Ta-Nehisi Coates.\n\nYet Afrofuturism reaches beyond superheroes. \u201cPeople often think Afrofuturism is a genre, while really it\u2019s a cultural movement. It isn\u2019t just black science fiction. It\u2019s a way for black folks across the diaspora to think about our past and future,\u201d says Morris. As such, Afrofuturism includes substreams like fiction, movies, art and fashion \u2013 Morris notes how Beyonc\u00e9 occasionally uses Afrofuturist imagery.\n\nIn the realm of written fiction, the Nigerian-American writer Nnedi Okorafor's Binti stands out. The 2015 book depicts an African tribe modelled on the Namibian Himba people, 1,000 years into the future. They are an advanced yet isolated community, and in the book one of their experts in advanced mathematics gets sent to an interstellar university where the story unfolds. \u201cIt\u2019s a great story that mixes tradition and innovation,\u201d says Morris.\n\nAfrofuturism is a genre that isn\u2019t necessarily associated with one country or region, but is practised by black people from all across the world, a diaspora in Morris\u2019s terms. For this diaspora, the interaction with tradition is key: Morris refers here to Sanfoka, a symbol from the Akan people in Ghana, generally stylised as a bird that looks backwards while moving forwards. \u201cAfrofuturism reveals a dynamic relationship between innovation and tradition that is at the heart of the diaspora\u201d, says Morris. \u201cIt looks back while moving forward.\u201d\n\nBolsheviks in space\n\nRussian and Eastern-European sci-fi has a long history stretching back to the 19th Century: it produced key writers in the canon like Russian writer Yevgeny Zamyatin, who wrote the 1924 novel We, and the Polish Stanislaw Lem, who was a key influence on US science-fiction. Even early Bolsheviks like Alexander Bogdanov wrote science-fiction (in his 1908 novel Red Star he notably depicted a Mars inhabited by socialists).\n\nThe experience of Sputnik was crucial. When, in 1957, the Soviets were the first to send a satellite around the Earth, it launched an explosion of science fiction and led to the re-discovery of older sci-fi works. Previously repressed by socialist realism, Soviet society was catapulted by the launch of Sputnik into a futurist perspective. Citing sci-fi expert Istvan Csicsery-Ronay from DePauw University, Banerjee claims this caused a \u201cscience-fictionality of daily life\u201d in the country.\n\nThis even stretched into movies. The 1972 film Solaris by Andrei Tarkovsky was hailed as a counterpart to 2001: A Space Odyssey, while Stalker, another movie by Tarkovsky and an adaption of 1971 novel The Roadside Picnic, depicted the crossing of a mysterious nuclear wasteland. Interestingly, decades later it inspired the present-day Ukrainian videogame series S.T.A.L.K.E.R.\n\nThe Russian experience, particularly under the Soviet Union, ties back into the current rise of non-Western science fiction. For Banerjee, this relates to her personal story. \u201cI grew up in eastern India, in coal-mining country,\u201d she says. \u201cThis place was not very culturally rich, but one set of books that were accessible and cheap were translated Russian books. And the Space Race saw a renaissance of science fiction writing in the Soviet Union, which, together with their classic science-fiction, was translated and disseminated into the Global South. Even into rural India.\u201d\n\nRussian sci-fi in this way served as an incubator for a new, global science fiction. \u201cIn the works of Cixin Liu, you can for example see references to Soviet science fiction,\u201d says Banerjee.\n\nFrom the West to the rest?\n\nThis rise of global science fiction questions how we think about the evolution of the genre. In the past, it was seen as spreading from Western centres to the rest of the world. \u201cThe traditional view of science fiction was that it expanded parallel to the spread of industrial capitalism around the globe,\u201d says Banerjee. \u201cSo it supposedly went from the West to the rest, because that\u2019s where industrial capitalism first took hold. Now this perspective is being challenged, and we are thinking about what happened outside the West.\u201d\n\nAlthough not all non-Western science fiction is political, imagining alternative futures can serve as a tool for mobilisation and activism. \u201cWhat we find in some science fiction from the global South is a recognition that a universalised, neoliberal model of society and culture are unsustainable,\u201d says Banerjee. She refers for example to Sleep Dealer, a 2008 Mexican sci-fi movie that depicts a future where the US has closed its Mexican border, but in which Mexicans remotely control the robots that replaced their labour inside the US. The movie reflects on issues like free trade and migration in a futurist fashion.\n\nBut beyond a global reflection on resistance, non-Western science fiction also taps into a worldwide consciousness \u2013 helping it conquer audiences beyond their respective home markets. \u201cChinese science fiction doesn\u2019t just appeal to Chinese people,\u201d says Mingwei. \u201cBecause it touches upon questions that are shared by humanity, for example the survival of the human race and how to be a moral person in extreme circumstances. Which are fundamental questions every human needs to think about in our contemporary world.\u201d\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "text": "On 29 November 1970, a family discovered the badly burned body of a woman in the bleak Isdalen Valley near Bergen, Norway. Labels were removed from her clothes and strange objects were scattered about: bottles; a broken umbrella; a watch. Carl Halvor Aas, a lawyer who was one of the first to be called to the scene, told the BBC that jewellery was placed beside the body \u201clike there had been some kind of ceremony\u201d.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- Eight TV shows to watch in December\n\n- The macabre mind of Edward Gorey\n\n- Was this the vision of a sadist?\n\nPolice later found disguises, coded messages and fake passports, but drew a blank when it came to discovering the true identity of the women the press called \u2018the Isdal Woman\u2019. Was it suicide, an accident or was she murdered?\n\nIn 2018, Norwegian investigative journalist Marit Higraff and documentary-maker Neil McCarthy investigated the cold case for the BBC in Death in Ice Valley, an atmospheric podcast with a relentless soundscape of rain pattering on the desolate hillsides. Despite modern testing methods to determine where the Isdal Woman came from and a Facebook group of online sleuths attempting to crack the case, it remains one of the country\u2019s most profound unsolved mysteries.\n\nDeath in Ice Valley was just one of a huge number of quality documentaries that have in recent years cemented true crime\u2019s place in popular culture.\n\nAnother was S-Town, the blockbuster 2017 podcast series from the producers of Serial. It was a riveting profile of John B McLemore, an eccentric clock restorer from Alabama \u2013 yet it was criticised for airing intimate details of its main character without consent, leading to McLemore\u2019s estate filing a lawsuit against the makers of the podcast. Although not a conventional true crime story, S-Town did investigate an alleged murder, and showed the audience\u2019s appetite for mystery: it has been downloaded nearly 80 million times since its release in March 2017.\n\nIn the Dark, the investigative journalism podcast from Madeleine Baran, was hailed as \u201cshocking but not sensationalised\u201d. The first season investigated the 1989 abduction and murder of 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling, who was snatched by a masked man while out cycling with friends in St Joseph, Minnesota. A second series featured the case of Curtis Flowers, a black man from Mississippi who was tried six times for the 1996 murder of four employees at a furniture shop where he had worked.\n\nAnd on television, programmes such as The People v OJ Simpson: American Crime Story, which starred Cuba Gooding Jr in a dramatisation of the \u2018Trial of the Century\u2019, have transformed the genre into unmissable prime-time programming.\n\nThe most popular of all has been Netflix\u2019s Making A Murderer. Film-makers Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos first discovered the unusual case of Wisconsin man Steven Avery after coming across the headline \u201cFreed by DNA, Now Charged in New Crime\u201d. The series followed the trial of Avery, who had already served 18 years for a crime he did not commit until he was exonerated by DNA evidence; he was then charged with the murder of 25-year-old photographer Teresa Halbach.\n\nAvery was subsequently given a life sentence along with his co-defendant and nephew, Brendan Dassey \u2013 but many viewers believed Avery was set up for the second murder by law officials. Throughout a compelling first season, the film-makers cast doubt on the legal process used to convict Dassey and recorded an alternative account, which suggested wrongdoings by prosecutors and the police. After an enormous public response, the second series of Making a Murderer largely dealt with the post-conviction and appeals process, and on the emotions of the families of the accused and of the victim, who had in the previous season felt like a minor character in the story.\n\nMiscarriages of justice\n\nWho would have predicted our seemingly insatiable appetite for debates about the merits of blood-spatter analysis or how the FBI tests for alleged planted evidence? For TV critic Jack Seale, the success of shows like Making a Murderer is down to counter-intuitive programme-making.\n\n\u201cIf you slow a true-crime documentary right down so you're lingering obsessively on every detail of the case, it\u2019s not boring; it\u2019s fascinating, because the significance of each small development is highlighted,\u201d Seale tells BBC Culture. \u201cThrow in some sly storytelling tricks \u2013 ending each episode on a bigger revelation that feels like a cliff-hanger in an episodic drama, for instance \u2013 and you've got a surprisingly addictive new genre.\u201d\n\nAnd technological changes in TV consumption have a part to play in the huge success of true-crime documentaries like Making a Murderer. \u201cIt\u2019s on Netflix, and Netflix don\u2019t have a weekly linear schedule,\u201d Seale explains. \u201cThis is key. If you\u2019d gone to BBC One, or NBC, or even HBO in 2015 and said: \u2018Hey, I\u2019ve got this great documentary for you, people will love it \u2013 oh and by the way, it\u2019s 10 hours long,\u2019 they\u2019d have laughed you out of the meeting. But online, programmes can theoretically go on forever, and viewers don\u2019t mind if they\u2019re epic because they can watch the next episode whenever they want.\u201d\n\nThe success of Making a Murderer was preceded by This American Life spin-off podcast Serial, which smashed download records back in 2014. Sarah Koenig spent a year investigating the 1999 murder of 18-year-old Baltimore student Hae Min Lee and the subsequent conviction of her former boyfriend Adnan Syed.\n\nThe podcast led to a judge ruling that Syed deserved a retrial, after his original lawyer failed to cross-examine a mobile phone tower expert about the reliability of data. It\u2019s hard to imagine how that would have happened without the attention Koenig and producer Julie Snyder brought to the case.\n\n\u201cSerial popularised true crime media, which was not about victimisation anymore, but miscarriages of justice,\u201d says Gemma Flynn, lecturer in criminology at the University of Edinburgh. \u201cI think actually that\u2019s been a really positive shift in the true crime genre, because what it\u2019s been doing with Making a Murderer and along with fictional programmes like Orange is the New Black, they create interest in the idea that the criminal justice system itself does not work, which is something that in criminology we\u2019re very interested in providing some focus on.\u201d\n\nBut in media crime research, Flynn says there\u2019s been some \u201cwringing of hands\u201d that there\u2019s not enough focus on the problems of the criminal justice system and too much on the idea that crimes can be solved by hyper-scientific methods. \u201cFor a long time,\u201d she explains, \u201cthere was an over-emphasis on programming like CSI, which led to a lot of problems [with] people over-inferring causal links for things like DNA testing and lie-detector testing.\u201d\n\nSeeking solace?\n\nAnother focus of interest for Flynn is that true crime\u2019s popularity is being driven largely by a large female fanbase. \u201cWhile women are not necessarily the most likely to be the victim[s] of crime, they are much more afraid of crime,\u201d she says. \u201cSo there\u2019s some kind of reframing happening around the idea of crime, especially for women.\u201d\n\nOne popular US podcast that climbed the download charts in 2018 is My Favorite Murder. Its loyal fans are dubbed \u201cmurderinos\u201d and are encouraged to send in details of hometown murders. In each episode, hosts Georgia Hardstark and Karen Kilgariff recall the plot of a murder case, much like how friends might recall a bad film they had just watched.\n\n\u201cStay sexy and don\u2019t get murdered!\u201d is the duo\u2019s credo (and upcoming book title), which raises an issue for Dr Flynn: \u201cIt is saying to their female fanbase in an explicit way that they might become a victim of crime, and in criminology we are not so happy with the idea of that, because crime rates are going down.\n\nThe women who are directing themselves towards grisly true crime podcasts, what is it exactly about the experience of womanhood that is making them seek some kind of solace in that? \u2013 Gemma Flynn\n\n\u201cWe find that a lot of the ways in which we don\u2019t understand crime comes from this problematic reframing, which says you\u2019re more likely to be a victim: which doesn\u2019t really match the picture officially,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe women who are in large numbers directing themselves towards grisly true crime podcasts, what is it exactly about the experience of womanhood that is making them seek some kind of solace in that?\u201d\n\nManchester comedian Rachel Fairburn co-hosts All Killa No Filla, a comedy podcast in which she discusses serial killers with fellow comic Kiri Pritchard McLean. The two friends began uploading episodes in 2014 after spending hours researching each case. Each show includes a caveat in the introduction: \u201cThis isn\u2019t hero worship, and as long as we are doing the podcast it stops us writing to them in prison.\u201d\n\nThis year the duo took the show on the road with live events where they came into contact with their fans. Most of those who turned up to the shows were women, Fairburn says. \u201cYour own safety is something you\u2019re always aware of as a woman. It\u2019s maybe that fear that you will always have inside you as a female: that you have to watch what you\u2019re doing, don\u2019t walk home late at night \u2013 and I think it\u2019s something within us that fascinates. It\u2019s having that awareness that it could happen to you.\u201d\n\nPeople have always been a bit grim \u2013 they used to go watch public executions \u2013 Rachel Fairburn\n\nTreading the line between murder and comedy is no easy task, but Fairburn notes that the humour in the podcast comes at the expense of the killer, not the victims. In a typical episode, the pair dubbed Dennis Rader \u201cthe Alan Partridge of serial killers\u201d because of his cringe-worthy sense of self-regard expressed through letters to police, and poke fun at the litany of mistakes that culminated in his capture.\n\nFairburn isn\u2019t surprised by the resurgence of interest in true crime, and puts it down to ease of access. She recalls a \u201cgrim\u201d early British tabloid that was a direct descendant of the execution broadsheets of the 18th Century: \u201cIf you go back to Victorian times, [people had] things like The Illustrated Police News with its sensational reports. People have always been a bit grim \u2013 they used to go watch public executions.\u201d\n\nToday we can experience decades of archive recordings and reporting edited down to just 10 hours \u2013 and our thirst for justice hasn\u2019t gone away. But however much we want to discover the truth, Dr Flynn explains, more often than not the quality true crime stories focus on \u2018howdunnit\u2019, not whodunnit.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about here is a piece of art \u2013 it\u2019s not academic objectivity, it\u2019s not research,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s being reframed and told to us in a way which primarily asks for us to follow the story.\u201d\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "text": "Some of the most profound decisions that you make in your life centre around family \u2013 from getting married to becoming a parent to even the best time to divorce your partner.\n\nThe seasons play a surprisingly strong role in these decisions, affecting our health, psychology and future prospects. The holiday calendar, too, dictates when is and isn\u2019t a good time to be making a big decision.\n\nWhile no two couples are the same, on a population level there are yearly patterns that emerge, showing the peak times to make important relationship decisions.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 The best time of year to make a life decision?\n\n\u2022 How marriage changes people forever\n\n\u2022 The truth about three childbirth myths\n\nBBC Future takes you through the calendar of when is most common \u2013 and when is best \u2013 to make big changes in your relationship.\n\nRing in the year\n\nIn the US, nearly 40% of engagements happen in the two-and-a-half months between Thanksgiving and Valentine\u2019s Day, according to a WeddingWire survey of 18,000 people. December, in particular, is the peak month for getting engaged \u2013 with Christmas Eve a particularly popular date. A third of men in a Chillisauce survey of 10,000 people thought it was the best time to pop the question.\n\nBut men, take note: women tend not to agree. The same survey found the date that women thought was best to get engaged was Valentine\u2019s Day, with 23% of votes. Unfortunately for them, the survey found that only 12% of proposals actually happened on Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nIn contrast Christmas Eve (the mens\u2019 favourite) was the most common date, with 31% of proposals on 24 December \u2013 perhaps a reflection of which partner was the one to get down on one knee. New Year's Eve was the next most common choice, followed by New Year's Day and then an anniversary of when the couple first met.\n\nWhile some surveys say the festive period is the most popular time, it\u2019s less clear when is the best time \u2013 there\u2019s no evidence that your engagement date has any bearing on the quality or length of your marriage. And, sadly, neither is there any data on the time of year that the apple of your eye is most likely to say yes.\n\nWedding bells\n\nDid your other half say yes? Then it\u2019s time to determine when to have the big day itself.\n\nThere are several factors to take into account. One is expense \u2013 the most popular time to get married in the US is autumn, while in the UK it is summer. In 2017 in the US, the most popular months for marriage were September (16%), June (15%) and October (14%), according to a survey of 13,000 brides and grooms by wedding-planning website The Knot.\n\nPicking a date outside these times is likely to get you a better deal \u2013 which may be important for more reasons than your bank balance. A study of 3,000 US couples found that those who had a cheaper wedding ceremony were more likely to have longer marriages. After controlling for demographic and relationship characteristics, the researchers found that those in longer-lasting marriages also spent less on their engagement ring.\n\nBut the study was only observational, meaning that the authors could not draw any conclusions about cause and effect. In other words, it might not be the January wedding that helps couples last longer. Having a cheaper wedding may just be a sign of relationship health \u2013 perhaps the couple doesn\u2019t feel the need to \u2018prove\u2019 their relationship to others with a big bash, or is focused on longer-term priorities that could signal deeper commitment.\n\nThe next factor to consider when picking a date is how old you and your partner will be. Tying the knot between the ages of 28 and 32 linked to the lowest levels of divorce five years later, according to a study by University of Utah sociology researcher Nick Wolfinger for the pro-marriage Institute for Family Studies.\n\nAnalysing data from more than 9,000 people, Wolfinger found that \u201cprior to age 32 or so, each additional year of age at marriage reduces the odds of divorce by 11%. However, after that the odds of divorce increase by 5% per year\u201d, he wrote in a blog post on his research.\n\nThe study suggests that there could be a \u2018Goldilocks effect\u2019 at work. Too young and we are still changing more year by year than later on in life, so marrying young may lead to later friction or growing apart. On the other hand, people who marry later in life may inherently be less suited to the institution, Wolfinger speculates. These people may somehow be more \u201ccongenitally cantankerous\u201d and have trouble with their personal relationships, putting them at higher risk of divorce.\n\nAs there is no causal evidence to prove this, trying to time your wedding to fit into the sweet spot of 28-32 is probably not going to make you immune to divorce.\n\nQuitting time\n\nBut what if it doesn\u2019t work out \u2014 is there any \u2018optimal\u2019 month to call it quits?\n\nIn the US, one Washington-based study found that there were two peaks in divorce applications, in March and August. The reason behind this, the authors speculate, is that couples hold off over the holidays during winter and summer. These breaks are \u201csymbolically charged moments\u201d when filing for divorce would often be seen as inappropriate, the authors say. Or perhaps they\u2019re simply impractical, as their lawyers may be out of the office too.\n\nBut once families and lawyers alike are back from their festivities, divorce applications surge. The reason the post-winter peak is delayed until March, the authors suggest, is because couples might take a while to get their resources together and hire a lawyer.\n\nBeyond Washington state, US family lawyers anecdotally report an annual spike in couples seeking to end their marriages in January. Exactly why January is a popular moment isn\u2019t clear, but it could be the combined effects of the end of the holiday period and the usual New Year urges for a fresh start.\n\nHow to hack your year This story is part of a series we\u2019re running on how to \u2018hack\u2019 your year. We\u2019re looking at the best time of year to make a big decision, buy a house, sit an exam, go to hospital and more. Keep checking back through December here for more stories.\n\nOr it could be a more prosaic reason: at least in the US, waiting until January has tax advantages. Divorces are often completed within a year, so filing for divorce in January can increase the odds of filing taxes as single person by the time the next tax year rolls around.\n\nThe jury is out, though, on whether filing at a certain time of year helps either party recover from the break-up faster.\n\nBaby boom\n\nWhat about starting a family? It may seem like birthdays are random \u2013 but in fact, there are more popular (and, in some ways, better) months of the year to give birth.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that sperm are healthier in spring than at any other time of year\n\nTake fertility. The quality and concentration of a man\u2019s sperm is an important factor, and several studies have shown that sperm are healthier in spring than at any other time of year. One study, presented at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine conference in Denver in 2018, analysed sperm samples taken over a 17-year period from 29,000 men in the US. The men had the highest numbers of moving sperm during springtime \u2013 at 117 million per millilitre. The lowest levels were in the summer, at 112 million. And autumn was when these men had the greatest number of normally shaped sperm \u2013 another measure of sperm quality. Another study of 12,245 men in Switzerland found that sperm concentration was also highest in the spring, and lowest in the summer.\n\nAnd samples collected in the morning had a higher sperm concentration and proportion of normally shaped sperm than those taken later in the day.\n\n\u201cThe idea that spring is better for sperm is because it takes about three months to produce the sperm from start to finish,\u201d says Allan Pacey, a professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield, who was not involved with either study. The sperm that are being ejaculated in spring were starting their life around Christmas, when it\u2019s colder.\u201d\n\nCool temperatures are good for sperm, which could suggest why sperm quality has a peak at this time. But other factors, such as the length of the day, also play a significant role in human fertility. Among other animals \u2013 such as sheep and cows \u2013 how many hours of light there are has a strong influence on when they are most fertile, to ensure their young are born with the best chances of surviving their first winter. It\u2019s possible that daylight could also have a similar effect in humans, says Pacey, with long summer days linked to lower fertility.\n\nAnother reason that sperm quality could be low in the summer, Pacey says, is because we are having less sex. Several studies have found that while abstinence boosts the number of sperm cells, it also leaves sperm in significantly poorer shape, with poorer swimming ability and more DNA damage. Frequent sex, on the other hand, results in sperm that have a better shape, swim better, have less DNA damage and give rise to higher pregnancy rates.\n\nBut the changes noted in these studies, while significant, shouldn\u2019t be relied upon to determine your calendar for trying to get pregnant, says Pacey. \u201cA small change in sperm quality doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to less chance of achieving pregnancy.\u201d\n\nBirthday boon\n\nThe best time of year for fertility is one thing, but what is the best time of year to be born?\n\nConceiving in the spring, around March or April in the Northern Hemisphere at least, would lead to a full-term pregnancy delivering in December or January. But the best time to be born is actually a few months earlier \u2013 in September. Interestingly, September also is the most common month for birthdays in the US and in the UK.\n\nChildren born in August were twice as likely to be bullied in primary school\n\nBritish children born in September tended to achieve better exam results than children born in August and had better cognitive skills, according to research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a UK think tank. Children born in August, on the other hand, were twice as likely to be bullied in primary school, 20% more likely to take vocational rather than academic qualifications at age 16-18, and 20% less likely to attend a top university. These effects were present regardless of a family\u2019s socioeconomic status, suggesting the effect is pervasive and hard to shift.\n\nThe researchers later discovered that this effect wasn\u2019t anything to do with the seasons \u2013 the same effect was seen across hemispheres, from Australia and Chile to Japan and the US. Instead, what all of these countries all have in common is the timing of the start of the academic year. The children\u2019s cognitive skills were that much better if they were September-born because they were usually the oldest of their classmates. August-born children tended to be the youngest.\n\nThe \u2018September effect\u2019 persisted throughout their school career. At eight years old, September-born children had a higher sense of competence relative to their classmates, with the reverse true for August-born children.\n\nBeing born in autumn may also boost your longevity. A study of nearly 1,600 US centenarians found that people born between September and November were more likely to live to 100 than those born in March. This could be down to nutritional deficiencies during pregnancy or the seasonality of infections.\n\nIn temperate regions, babies born in the autumn avoid experiencing extreme temperatures right after birth, which can have surprisingly profound health consequences in later life. A UK study of more than 4,000 women found colder winter temperatures at birth was linked to a higher risk of coronary heart disease, insulin resistance and poor lung function in old age.\n\nWomen born in the coldest quarter of the year were 24% more likely to develop coronary heart disease\n\nWomen born in the coldest quarter of the year (based on actual temperatures in the year of their birth) were 24% more likely to develop coronary heart disease than women born in the other three-quarters of the year. The association was strongest for those whose fathers were unemployed or in manual jobs, suggesting that the effect may be down to these families struggling to heat their homes adequately.\n\nWe might like to think that every couple is unique. But the emerging trends in when people make their big decisions reveal the surprising extent to which external forces shape our relationships. Some of them seem incidental, like the holiday calendar influencing when people are most likely to turn their thoughts to romance and family. Others appear to be a product of our biology, like the fresh temperatures of spring lending a subtle boost to male fertility.\n\nAnd as the September effect shows, the most robust trends happen when calendar events and the deeper biological effects of seasonal changes are in alignment.\n\nResearch by Miriam Quick.\n\n\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "text": "There are few experiences as universal as catching a cold. And while there are around 200 viruses that cause it, there seem to be almost as many home remedies to combat it.\n\nBut do any of them work?\n\nAt the core of any home remedy is the idea that it bolsters our immune system. When a virus enters our bodies, it comes up against two systems of defence: the innate immune system tries to flush invading cells out, while the adaptive system targets specific pathogens that the body already has had contact with and creates memory cells of new ones, so the body can fight them off if they return. This is why we tend to get chicken pox only once, whereas the common cold \u2013 which changes its appearance as it passes from one person to the next, confusing our memory cells \u2013 is something we can experience dozens of times.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 Why vitamin pills may be bad for you\n\n\u2022 Should everyone be taking vitamin D?\n\n\u2022 Do\u2019s and don\u2019ts for common colds\n\nIt\u2019s well-known that both lifestyle habits and diet affect the strength of our immune systems.\n\nBut because the immune system is only impaired in otherwise healthy people when we have a vitamin or mineral deficiency, supplementing our diets with so-called cold-busting foods will make little difference if we already have a relatively good diet, says Charles Bangham, head of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Imperial College London.\n\n\u201cOnly if you\u2019re short of a vital nutrient, such as vitamin, zinc or iron, will supplementing that particular item be very helpful. But if you eat a balanced diet, adding more of these things doesn\u2019t make the immune system any more efficient,\u201d he says.\n\nSupplement solution\n\nEven so, studies looking into cures for the common cold have found that they can make a difference.\n\nThe vast majority of these studies concentrate on supplements, rather than food \u2013 in fact, no reliable research has been done on whether a popular cure like chicken soup actually makes a difference.\n\nBut one supplement that may help is popular home remedy garlic. In one small study, 146 healthy adults were given either a placebo or a daily garlic supplement for 12 weeks over winter. The placebo group contracted 65 colds, resulting in 366 days of sickness \u2013 whereas those who had garlic supplements only contracted 24 colds, with 111 days of sickness between them.\n\nOne review on vitamin C supplements didn\u2019t find that supplements greatly reduce the risk of getting colds\n\nAnother supplement many people reach for when they feel cold symptoms is vitamin C. Some research suggests it too can help \u2013 though not as much as you might think. One review analysing 29 studies on vitamin C supplements didn\u2019t find that supplements greatly reduce the risk of getting colds, or that they alleviate symptoms. But it did find that children saw a 14% reduction in the length of their colds; in adults, the reduction was 8%. Researchers concluded that since the supplements are low-risk, it may be worthwhile trying them to see if they can help.\n\nOrange juice may be less useful: there is no robust evidence that orange juice helps prevent colds, alleviate symptoms or reduce a cold\u2019s length. This is because it doesn\u2019t contain high enough doses of vitamin C to have the same impact as daily supplements, says Harri Hemil\u00e4, a public health researcher at the University of Helsinki and author of the vitamin C supplements review. A standard small bottle of fresh orange juice has around 72mg of vitamin C, according to the US Department of Agriculture \u2013 that\u2019s more than the recommended daily minimum of 40mg, but still less than many supplements.\n\nThen there\u2019s zinc. One review examining the effectiveness of daily zinc acetate lozenges on the common cold found that they shortened the duration of runny and blocked noses by around a third, plus led to 22% less sneezing and almost half as much coughing.\n\nThe study concluded that if started within 24 hours of the first symptoms, 80mg daily zinc acetate lozenges may help treat the common cold.\n\nPatients with a cold who were given zinc lozenges recovered three times faster\n\nHowever, Hemil\u00e4 argues it\u2019s more accurate to study recovering from a cold fully, rather than measuring symptom duration \u2013 which avoids data being affected by people dropping out of the study before fully recovering from their cold, and to avoid those with extended colds skewing the findings. His study of 199 common cold patients found that those with a cold who were given zinc lozenges recovered three times faster.\n\nOften, scientists say that vitamins and minerals are best consumed through foods, rather than supplements \u2013 though they point out that, as with vitamin C, it\u2019s often easier to get high doses of a vitamin through supplements.\n\nFor zinc, however, the opposite is true. In order to be effective against colds, zinc must come from lozenges and not from ordinary zinc tablets or zinc-rich foods, Hemil\u00e4 says.\n\n\u201cZinc lozenges are slowly dissolved in the throat region and the effect of zinc is local,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the biochemical mechanism of this effect is. But studies finding zinc lozenges to be effective used large lozenges that have dissolved for up to 30 minutes in the mouth.\u201d\n\nCold comfort\n\nStill, one complication is that researchers haven\u2019t tended to look at whether people were deficient in something like vitamin C or zinc before they started a regimen. So, any cold-fighting benefit might be down to the fact that by taking a supplement, some participants were correcting a deficiency, rather than the supplement making a difference for already healthy people.\n\nAnother complication is the power of placebo. Of course, many studies, like that on garlic supplements, do control with a placebo-only group \u2013 so the effect for those isn\u2019t down to placebo alone.\n\nBut if we swear that something for which there\u2019s limited or no scientific evidence, like chicken soup or orange juice, really cures us, it may be down to placebo. Placebos have been found to be effective in alleviating many symptoms, from pain to irritable bowel syndrome, although the reasons why aren\u2019t yet fully understood. And whether for vitamin C or chicken soup, the placebo effect alone could help us get over a cold.\n\nPeople who believed in the alleged cold-fighting properties of echinacea experienced milder and shorter colds when taking daily doses, compared to than those who didn\u2019t believe in it\n\nOne study found that people who believed in the alleged cold-fighting properties of herbal remedy echinacea experienced milder and shorter colds when taking daily doses, compared to than those who didn\u2019t believe in it. Previous studies in which participants weren't aware they were getting echinacea weren't shown to improve cold symptoms.\n\nIt works the other way, too. Milk has long been thought to worsen mucus production when we have a cold, although this has now been debunked. But one study found that people who believed that milk causes mucus reported more respiratory symptoms after drinking it. (Find out more in our BBC Future story Should you avoid dairy when you have a cold?).\n\nWhile placebos are usually administered by doctors in clinical trials, the placebo power of home remedies can come from our everyday lives, says Felicity Bishop, associate professor of health psychology at the University of Southampton.\n\n\u201cStudies show the power of the placebo pill comes from a trusted relationship between patients and healthcare professionals, someone who is caring and can offer treatments with confidence,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd this is kind of what parents do when we\u2019re young. It\u2019s the nature of the relationship is important, rather than who that person is.\u201d\n\nAs well as trusted friends and family, the placebo effect could also be strengthened by how foods are marketed, Bishop adds.\n\nThe good news? Knowing that home remedies are placebos won\u2019t necessarily stop them from alleviating our symptoms. \u201cOpen-label placebos, when a doctor tells the patient something is a placebo but that it\u2019s helped some people, can still make patients better,\u201d she says.\n\nAnother effect could be the comfort induced by such foods. Dietician Sarah Schenker says the comfort of having chicken soup, for example, could help someone with a cold to feel slightly better.\n\nRather than how much vitamin C we stock up on, the chances of being able to stave off bugs in winter depends largely on the individual \u2013 including how much we believe in placebos, but also because of our genes.\n\nSome people\u2019s genes make them particularly susceptible to certain diseases \u2013 Sarah Schenker\n\n\u201cSome people\u2019s genes make them particularly susceptible to certain diseases. It\u2019s much more important to realise we all differ genetically from one another \u2013 when some people have the flu, they don\u2019t realise they\u2019ve got it, while others get a very serious disease. This is partly determined by your genes, which have much more of an impact.\u201d\n\nFor the majority of us with healthy immune systems, we can do little more than rely on the power of placebos to get over winter bugs\u2026 though popping some zinc or garlic supplements might help too.\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "text": "Two brothers on the autistic spectrum were looking for work when one had the idea of opening a comic shop. It turned out to be an inspired choice.\n\nWhen Adam Makey told his mother that he wanted to open a comic shop, she laughed out loud.\n\nThe idea seemed \"ridiculous\", Angela Makey says. She knew he'd been obsessed with comics since childhood. But how would he deal with customers and suppliers and all the other jobs that running a business entails? His Asperger syndrome would be a big hindrance, she thought.\n\nOn the other hand, it wasn't clear what else Adam would do for a living.\n\nHe had a degree in philosophy and had learned to live independently, but there didn't seem to be any suitable jobs going.\n\nThe family had hoped he and his younger brother Guy, also on the autistic spectrum, could find work that matched their strengths: reliability, punctuality and attention to detail. But all available opportunities seemed to involve occasional shift work - and they needed a regular routine.\n\nAngela had seen statistics from the National Autistic Society, which said that only about one in six people with autism were in full-time employment. Fewer still had found jobs that matched their abilities.\n\n\"We knew the cards were stacked against them,\" she says.\n\nSo the \"laughable\" comic shop idea began to grow on her.\n\nEventually she used her savings to buy a quaint Tudor shop in Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, and seven years ago Niche Comics was born.\n\nImage copyright Niche Comics Image caption Guy (left), Angela and Adam\n\nLike many people with autism, Adam and Guy love comics for their world of rich detail and visual expression. For some it helps that the characters' emotions are so clearly signposted.\n\nThere is also something appealing about the stories they tell.\n\n\"Comics became very important to me when my parents told me about my Asperger syndrome diagnosis,\" explains Adam Makey.\n\n\"They are a reminder that it's OK to not be like everyone else.\"\n\nAutism and work\n\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the name for a range of conditions, including Asperger syndrome, that affect a person's social interaction, communication, interests and behaviour\n\nIt can be difficult for people with ASD to find a job - for example, they may find the work environment too noisy, or travelling to work may be too stressful because of the crowds... sudden changes in routine can also be upsetting\n\nA report from the National Autistic Society estimates that only 16% of autistic adults are in full-time, paid work\n\nSee also:Help and support for people with ASD (NHS)\n\nAdam was seven at the time, and just graduating from an interest in Beano and Dandy to Marvel comic heroes on TV. He's now 30, and comics and their heroes have been part of his life all that time.\n\nThere's also the escapist fantasy element, says Guy. He pauses to consider something else. The larger-than-life superheroes with a moral mission are appealing. \"Their motivations are easier to understand, their aims and goals are easier to decipher than, say, someone you've met in the street.\"\n\nAdam says he was drawn particularly to Spiderman. \"It's because of the whole, 'with power comes great responsibility' theme,\" he says. \"He was just a regular person who had powers and wanted to help people.\"\n\nImage copyright Alamy\n\nAccording to Angela another big factor is that comics are \"not seen as judgmental, there is no age-limit, there isn't any measure of ability\". An adult is just as welcome in the world of comics as a child.\n\nComic fans can also relish building up encyclopaedic knowledge of characters, editions, publishers, authors, illustrators, one-off collaborations - and this is something the brothers are adept at.\n\nInterested in comics about Vampires in the horror genre?\n\nAdam would humbly suggest American Vampire by Vertigo Comics.\n\n\"Originally it was a collaboration between Scott Snyder who does some of the current Batman stuff for DC and Stephen King the famous horror writer,\" he points out.\n\nHe continues without pausing: \"Vertigo was the home of Hellblazer, which is the home of John Constantine, which is a very popular character, to the point where he got his own TV show for a while and he is still a character on Legends of Tomorrow, the DC TV show. And also they did the Keanu Reeves film, which is very different from the comic. And they do Sandman as well, which is Neil Gaiman's big-name comic.\"\n\nThe brothers relish acting as guides in this universe, introducing customers to new comics.\n\n\"The beauty of it is you can hand-pick the comics in your own shop. It's an embarrassment of riches,\" says Guy, 26.\n\n\"We have a system of organised chaos.\"\n\nBut the brothers can pinpoint where every comic is and lead customers straight to them.\n\nThere is some friendly rivalry when it comes to generating sales, and converting newcomers to their favourite genres: for Guy, the classics from the 40s and 50s, featuring Superman and Captain America, for example; for Adam, newer comics like Black Panther and Sandman.\n\nIn the early days, problems with numeracy and communication - with customers and suppliers - threatened the very existence of the shop.\n\nTypically with autism you don't find uniform levels of ability across subject areas, explains Angela, but peaks in some and troughs in others.\n\n\"Adam and Guy are both very visual, incredibly interested in literature and plays,\" she says. \"However one of their troughs is mathematics. Letting loose two young adults with autism was quite a risky business.\"\n\nCustomer payments were a big problem. The brothers struggled to enter prices into the till, and then to enter the same total on the card-reader machine.\n\n\"Numbers went the wrong way round, or there was a zero missing,\" recalls Angela.\n\nTo get round this, the shop invested in a till where barcodes, prices and the card-reader machine are all integrated and no numbers are inputted at the point of sale.\n\nThere were also problems dealing with the companies that provide stock. People with autism need very clear, literal instructions and don't like uncertainty, Angela says. Important information needs to be well sign-posted whereas in everyday conversation, sentences are often left incomplete and thoughts unfinished.\n\nA joint email inbox became necessary so Angela could intervene if she saw any confusion creeping in.\n\nThese days Angela describes her main role in the shop as \"interferer\".\n\nWorking full-time with an IT Services company outside Huntingdon, she can only devote so much time to her sons' business. She looks after accounts, tax returns and online sales, but they take care of the day-to-day running of the shop.\n\nFinancially it has always remained in the black, though the brothers only draw a small wage.\n\nOf course, the majority of customers who come to the shop are not on the autistic spectrum. But the brothers do get a steady stream of customers who are, both male and female, from young children to pensioners. These people may deliberately seek out the shop because of its reputation for offering a welcoming experience.\n\n\"Being on the autistic spectrum ourselves is a big help dealing with neurodiverse people,\" Adam says.\n\nNot every customer with autism wants to discuss their condition, but the brothers are good at spotting the signs.\n\n\"It's an instinctual thing,\" says Adam.\n\n\"Maybe it's the tone of the voice, the motion of a hand,\" says Guy. \"Small details that most people won't pick up on that I might have insight into; rubbing of the fingers, fidgeting, or just a sense of distraction.\"\n\nThe shop has been laid out with these customers in mind. People with autism feel textures, sounds and light very keenly, to the point where they can become overwhelming.\n\n\"We make sure there aren't too many distractions and we are aware that people with autism might have very specific interests,\" Adam says.\n\nOne of the reasons the shop is called Niche is that it has nooks and crannies where customers can retire to read in peace and quiet, away from undesired sensory stimulation.\n\nOnce the shop had established itself, the brothers also began reaching out to people with autism beyond the shop.\n\nThree years ago Adam started giving talks to young people who are learning-disabled. As a result, some teachers realised that graphic novels were a great way to reach out to people on the spectrum.\n\nBuilding on those links, the brothers began to take regular \"referrals\" for work experience from schools and colleges.\n\nThe idea is people with disabilities can practise for working life in a safe space.\n\nThis is one way the shop can serve the community, says Angela, providing opportunities that less sympathetic employers would not.\n\n\"The hidden disabilities of communication and autism are forgotten or overlooked by many people,\" she says.\n\n\"Individuals on the spectrum can be articulate, opinionated, excellent problem solvers, but also incredibly reliable.\"\n\nIn short, excellent employees, if given the right support.\n\nYoung people on work experience are first set a task in isolation, often sorting out comics at the rear of the shop, which is repetitive and methodical. Eventually they will graduate to working behind the till.\n\n\"After a few days,\" says Angela, \"people who were perhaps not communicating at all come outside themselves and start engaging.\n\n\"That's the joy, to see the change.\"\n\nSeven years on, Angela is glad she took the risk of helping her sons create their dream shop.\n\n\"It's been an emotional journey and if I'd known what I know now, I would have had to dig deep to go ahead with it,\" she says.\n\n\"But it was the right decision. This shop has a soul.\"\n\nYou can follow Dougal Shaw on Twitter: @dougalshawBBC\n\nYou may also be interested in the 1800 seconds on autism podcast, from BBC Sounds:\n\nListen to the podcast, or download it, here\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter."

    "text": "Image copyright Shutterstock Image caption The biggest threat to angel sharks is commercial fishing\n\nSome of the world's most unusual sharks and rays are on the brink of extinction because of threats such as commercial fishing, scientists have said.\n\nA shark that uses its tail to stun prey and a ray half the length of a bus are on the list of 50 species.\n\nThe scientists say sharks have a bad image and people do not understand how important and threatened they are.\n\nAnd losing even one of these \"living fossils\" would wipe out millions of years of evolutionary history.\n\n\"The biggest myth around sharks is definitely the perception that they are dangerous, that they are man-eating machines - they're not,\" marine biologist Fran Cabada told BBC News.\n\n\"There have been some negative interactions recorded but they are very infrequent and they're not intentional.\"\n\nImage copyright Shutterstock Image caption Despite their fearsome teeth, sand tiger sharks usually attack humans only in self-defence\n\nThis is the first time sharks, rays and chimeras (fish with cartilage in place of bones) have been assessed for the Edge (Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered) of Existence programme.\n\nMost sharks are at the top of the food chain, which makes them crucial to the health of the oceans.\n\nLosing them would have a big impact on other fish populations and, ultimately, human livelihoods.\n\n\"They have very few relatives on the tree of life, so they are very unique and losing them will actually represent a big, big loss,\" said Fran Cabada.\n\nThe assessment found fishing, both targeted and accidental, was to blame for the steep decline in many of these populations, together with habitat loss due to coastal development, degradation of mangrove forests, water pollution and trawling.\n\n\"The Edge sharks and rays list comprises some of the most interesting and unique fish we have on this planet,\" said Dr Matthew Gollock, of ZSL.\n\n\"The modern extinction of a single species from this list would cause the loss of millions of years of evolutionary history.\"\n\nHere are some of the species on the list:\n\nThe largetooth sawfish (Pristis pristis)\n\nImage copyright Simon Fraser University\n\nThis ray ranks first on the list. It is at risk from unsustainable fishing and being unintentionally caught in nets. The largetooth sawfish's most distinctive feature is its snout (rostrum) lined with sharp teeth to slash its prey. Cowboy boots were once made from sawfish skin.\n\nThe Caribbean electric ray (Narcine bancroftii)\n\nImage copyright Shutterstock\n\nThis ray can produce an electric shock, which it uses to stun its prey. The fish hide in sand or mud during the day and forage for worms and other small prey at night.\n\nThe zebra shark (Stegostoma fasciatum)\n\nImage copyright Shutterstock\n\nThis shark changes in appearance over its lifetime. The young are born with zebra stripes, which change to spots as they get older. It lives on the sea floor, and has a lifespan of 25 to 35 years.\n\nThe whale shark (Rhincodon typus)\n\nImage copyright Shutterstock\n\nThe biggest fish in the sea, reaching up to 20m (65ft) in length, it is a filter feeder, relying on plankton and small fishes to survive.\n\nThe basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus)\n\nImage copyright Shutterstock\n\nThe basking shark is the second largest species of shark (and fish) in the world behind the enormous whale shark.\n\nFollow Helen on Twitter."

From the BBC Oral History Collection.\n\nAfter moving on to a billet in Eindhoven, Audrey reported on the preparations for the crossing of the Rhine in conditions of appalling mud.\n\nAs the only woman, she was rather spoiled and the BBC engineers made her a hairdryer out of German pop up toasters.\n\nHer reporting reflected the human stories of the war, the \u2018background material\u2019 as she called it:\n\nThere was one day I discovered, two women, one of them was I think English and had been attached to the Red Cross and she'd made friends with a Dutch woman and they were really indomitable, they took over a half deserted well it was completely deserted but half ruined factory. And they did this for the old and the ill and the blind because for the first time in my life I realised that refugees flying from the enemy or the battle or whatever are likely to desert their elderly relatives and I was with them when we found some poor old blind man who'd been without food and water in a cellar for days just left there, he hardly knew what was going on you know. And so they shipped them all to this factory and they had soft food for them - a huge great tub which they put everything in, like a sort of perpetual soup you know. And this was really a wonderful story you know.\n\nInterview with Audrey Russell, 1977. From the BBC Oral History Collection.\n\nAudrey had discovered what many modern women war reporters will say: their sensitive coverage can bring these individual stories to life.\n\nIn her oral history interview, she spoke candidly about what happened when she was instructed to go to Antwerp. She went even though the famous war correspondent Frank Gillard was against it:\n\nHe thought it was a bit tough and it was. We walked right into the worst week of flying bomb attacks in Antwerp of the war, when there were 7 or 8 flying bombs in the air at once, you could see them you never heard the silence because there was always another one to come droning on. That was very tough really but it was interesting you know.\n\nInterview with Audrey Russell, 1977. From the BBC Oral History Collection.\n\nWhile she was in Antwerp, they had \"one rather terrible incident in which we seemed to get involved in trying to help. There was a direct hit on a house full of young marines and the casualties were appalling and we helped with the truck in various ways.\" The commanding officer wrote to the BBC in praise of Audrey\u2019s efforts.\n\nSomeone back at base must have looked into her pay and a series of letters arrived advising her that her salary had been raised:\n\nI was still being paid less than the men, in fact most of my career I have been paid less than the men, but on this occasion I know they were shamed into doing something.\n\nInterview with Audrey Russell, 1977.From the BBC Oral History Collection.\n\nThat was not a cause for resentment during the war as she felt the men had a much tougher time but it rankled later on:\n\nI was very angry when on one occasion I discovered on a royal tour that one commentator, a very great friend of mine was being paid \u00a325 a week more than me and we were both doing exactly the same job, exactly the same weary miles and in fact I think my output was larger than his. I resented that and I complained and well, I was very severely ticked off, but that didn\u2019t bother me.\n\nInterview with Audrey Russell, 1977. From the BBC Oral History Collection.\n\nI wonder if she would have been surprised to learn that seventy years on those battles are still going on. In her 1972 interview with Sue McGregor she described the attitude of the men at the BBC:"

Rodriguez who says, along with medical advances, it was Cameron's determination to survive that helped make the surgery a success.\n\n\"In the end, it's all about the patient. Cameron has put in the work and has made the necessary commitments,\" he says.\n\nCameron's transplant was the third carried out by Dr Rodriguez and he says the relatively short time in which Cameron had lived with his injuries was also a major factor in his recovery.\n\n\"Cameron has not lived with his injury for a decade or longer like most other face transplant recipients have,\" he says.\n\n\"As a result, he has not had to deal with many of the long-term psychosocial issues which often lead to issues like severe depression, substance abuse, and other potentially harmful behaviours.\"\n\nDuring the surgery, the doctor transplanted and reconstructed Cameron's upper and lower jaw, including all 32 teeth and gums.\n\nThe roof and floor of his mouth, lower eyelids and nose were replaced and his tongue needed reconstruction.\n\nThe centre says the operation was the most technologically advanced face transplant and was the first use of a 3D-printed donor facial mask in the US.\n\n'My son is helping Cameron live a better life'\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Sally Fisher, the mum of donor Will, says she may not have \"survived\" losing her son if it wasn't for Cameron\n\nThe donor was 23-year-old Will Fisher, a chess champion, aspiring writer and filmmaker.\n\n\"My son's death was a tragedy,\" says Will's mum Sally.\n\n\"I am thankful that, in honouring his decision, we were able to give life to others, and especially that Will and Dr Rodriguez have given Cameron and his family a chance to recapture their dreams.\n\n\"Being a part of this experience has been a source of strength for me during a very difficult time.\n\n\"I don't think I would have survived Will's death if not for Cameron. Cameron has his whole life ahead of him - and I love the idea that Willie is helping him have a better life.\"\n\nImage copyright Fisher family Image caption Will was a registered organ donor before his death\n\nCameron paid tribute to Will and the support of the Fisher family during his speech at the hospital's press conference.\n\n\"I want Sally and her family to know how much my family and I appreciate their gift and I'll always honour Will's legacy,\" he says.\n\n\"There have been so many amazing advances in surgery. I'm living proof of that.

    "text": "Image copyright Victoire Frencia Image caption Best of friends: Victoire Frencia reckons Kiwi eats better than she does\n\nThe UK's known as a nation of dog lovers, but with ever more opportunities to spoil our best friends, is the \"pooch pound\" getting out of control?\n\n\"Living the life of a wealthy, middle-class dog must be wonderful. If I'm reincarnated I hope it's as that.\"\n\nVictoire Frencia is a 25-year-old living in London and working in marketing. She's talking about the lifestyle enjoyed by her 18-month-old dog Kiwi, rescued from Cyprus.\n\n\"It definitely falls into the category of 'my-dog-eats-organic-and-better-than-me', new toys and treats every month,\" she says. \"It is a high cost, her doggy day care alone sets us back close to \u00a35,000 a year.\"\n\nIn total, what she and her partner spend on food, toys and the rest equates to roughly half of what they spend on their mortgage - or put another way 5% of their joint incomes.\n\n\"Yes, I think it's definitely over the top,\" she admits. However, she adds: \"It's nice to provide 'the best'.\"\n\n'Family members'\n\nVictoire is not alone in wanting to pamper her pooch.\n\nEuromonitor estimates the dog food market this year is worth just under \u00a31.6bn, about 1.7% down on 2017. However, the premium dog food sector - brands like Lily's Kitchen, Royal Canin and The Rockster - has risen 2.2% to \u00a3379m.\n\nImage copyright Victoire Frencia Image caption Who could resist the appeal in Cypriot rescue dog Kiwi's eyes?\n\nOne factor driving the market is what's known as the \"humanisation\" of pets, according to Trishna Shah, senior market analyst with Euromonitor. \"The idea that we're not thinking about pets as animals: these are actual family members. These are our children,\" she says.\n\n\"People almost equate their love with how much they're spending on their pets. People are spending more on better quality products for their pets.\"\n\nHarder to put a value on are all the services available to dog owners. With nine million pooches in the UK, doggy day care, dog walkers and dog grooming in particular have proliferated, says the Pet Industry Federation, catering for people who are working.\n\nSo why do people like Victoire Frencia spend so much on their dogs?\n\n\"It's just nice to care for something other than ourselves,\" she says.\n\nPuppy paraphernalia\n\nSpool back a few months and Victoire's story might have surprised me.\n\nNow though, as the new owner of Bertie, the Portuguese Water Dog, a whole new world of puppy paraphernalia and pampering has been opened up to me.\n\nA quick search of the internet revealed fountains flowing with Evian water, Fortnum and Mason food and a Japanese Ofur\u00f4 bath designed to relax aching limbs.\n\nImage copyright The Little Lord Barkley Image caption Cocktail time at The Little Lord Barkley?\n\nNot a luxurious spa holiday for humans, but just some of the services offered at The Little Lord Barkley dog hotel in Surrey.\n\nIt charges between \u00a355 and \u00a375 a night, and offers services including a \"dog nanny\" and a chauffeur-driven pick-up and drop-off in a Range Rover.\n\nDenise Soares set up the business after finding it hard to find a \"reliable, safe and happy environment\" for her Dachshund.\n\nShe admits they're at the top end of the market. \"We're not trying to get 80% of the market we're trying to get 20% of the market.\n\nImage copyright Crispin Luxton Image caption Percy the Pug is one of the hotel's VIP - very important pet - guests\n\n\"We have had clients that just wanted their dogs to drink chicken water, which means to boil the chicken in water - in this case, organic chicken from Harrods - remove the chicken and let the water cool down - then give it to the dog, our guest.\"\n\n'All they need is attention'\n\nHowever, Kennel Club secretary Caroline Kisko, warns against going too far.\n\n\"Dogs don't need luxury treatments, fashionable clothes or extensive pampering.\n\n\"People may think that feeding their dogs lots of rich, tasty food is a nice thing to do for their pet, but it may not suit their dietary requirements and could actually result in an upset stomach or the dog becoming overweight, which brings with it a host of health concerns.\n\n\"Taking them for walks, providing social and mental stimulation and giving them lots of attention is all the indulgence they need.\"\n\nImage copyright Crispin Luxton Image caption No photos please? Crispin Luxton wants Percy to be well cared for when he is away\n\nSo what persuades clients to book their dogs into a hotel like The Little Lord Barkley?\n\n'Peace of mind'\n\nCrispin Luxton, 43, owns an IT consultancy in London and spends 10 days a month in Los Angeles. He books his two-year-old Pug Percy into the hotel while he is away.\n\nPercy's 10-day stay costs on average \u00a3450 every month. Crispin says it gives him \"peace of mind when I'm abroad\", and he finds the collection and drop-off service very useful. \"They've got it all sorted. I'm paying for the convenience.\"\n\nIn general, he reckons he spends about \u00a37,000 a year on Percy, including the hotel stays, on food, insurance, toys, coats, treats and leads.\n\nOf course some people would say that's over the top, but Crispin says: \"I think it's all relative. People spend ridiculous amounts of money on holidays, gardens and clothes. It's about what you get out of that.\"\n\nHe admits some of the things on offer at The Little Lord Barkley are a \"bit excessive\" though. \"At the end of the day he's a dog.\"\n\nImage copyright The Little Lord Barkley Image caption Better than a muddy puddle? Fountains flowing with Evian water\n\nSo does Denise Soares ever feel the concept is slightly ludicrous? \"It's done in a light-hearted, good-spirited way,\" she says.\n\n\"A lot of owners want to feel they're giving their dogs something a bit over the top - they feel guilty because they're away.\"\n\n'A dog can forget it's a dog'\n\nOf course it's not necessary to go to these lengths and most dogs don't get this level of pampering.\n\nThe People's Dispensary for Sick Animals estimates the minimum monthly cost of caring for a dog is between \u00a370 to \u00a3105, depending on its size and says 69% of owners underestimate this cost.\n\nWhile the Dogs Trust says: \"We do not encourage people to treat dogs like humans as this risks the dog forgetting what it is to be a dog and can cause him to behave in an unnatural way and even potentially develop behavioural problems.\n\n\"Whilst it is nice to occasionally pamper a pet, whether that is by grooming it, giving it the odd treat or allowing it to sleep on the bed with you, there are limits and the animal's comfort and wellbeing should always be the priority.\"\n\nImage copyright Victoire Frencia Image caption Kiwi looks slightly sceptical about her advent calendar\n\nSo how does Victoire Frencia respond to people who say \"a dog's a dog\", don't go over the top?\n\n\"Each to their own. I would never let it get in the way of my dog behaving properly and doing what's it's told.\"\n\nWith Christmas around the corner I ask Victoire if Kiwi can expect any gifts.\n\n\"Embarrassingly, yes. She's got an advent calendar.\""

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nAround the world, children are far more likely than ever before to develop food allergies.\n\nRecent inquiries into the deaths of two British teenagers after eating sesame and peanut highlighted the sometimes tragic consequences. In August, a six-year-old girl in Western Australia died as the result of a dairy allergy.\n\nThe rise in allergies in recent decades has been particularly noticeable in the West. Food allergy now affects about 7% of children in the UK and 9% of those in Australia, for example. Across Europe, 2% of adults have food allergies.\n\nLife-threatening reactions can be prompted even by traces of the trigger foods, meaning patients and families live with fear and anxiety. The dietary restrictions which follow can become a burden to social and family lives.\n\nWhile we can't say for sure why allergy rates are increasing, researchers around the world are working hard to find ways to combat this phenomenon.\n\nImage copyright Family handout/PA Wire Image caption British teenager Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died after eating a baguette containing sesame seeds\n\nWhat causes an allergy?\n\nAn allergy is caused by the immune system fighting substances in the environment that it should see as harmless, known as allergens.\n\nThese innocent substances become targets, leading to allergic reactions.\n\nSymptoms range from skin redness, hives and swelling to - in the most severe cases - vomiting, diarrhoea, difficulty breathing and anaphylactic shock.\n\nSome of the most common foods for children to be allergic to are:\n\nmilk\n\neggs\n\npeanuts\n\ntree nuts (eg walnuts, almonds, pine nuts, brazil nuts, pecans)\n\nsesame\n\nfish\n\nshellfish (eg crustaceans and molluscs)\n\nWhere are food allergies most likely to occur?\n\nThe frequency of food allergy has increased over the past 30 years, particularly in industrialised societies. Exactly how great the increase is depends on the food and where the patient lives.\n\nFor example, there was a five-fold increase in peanut allergies in the UK between 1995 and 2016.\n\nA study of 1,300 three-year-olds for the EAT Study at King's College London, suggested that 2.5% now have peanut allergies.\n\nAustralia has the highest rate of confirmed food allergy. One study found 9% of Australian one-year-olds had an egg allergy, while 3% were allergic to peanuts.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe increase in allergies is not simply the effect of society becoming more aware of them and better at diagnosing them.\n\nIt is thought that allergies and increased sensitivity to foods are probably environmental, and related to Western lifestyles.\n\nWe know there are lower rates of allergies in developing countries. They are also more likely to occur in urban rather than rural areas.\n\nFactors may include pollution, dietary changes and less exposure to microbes, which change how our immune systems respond.\n\nMigrants appear to show a higher prevalence of asthma and food allergy in their adopted country compared to their country of origin, further illustrating the importance of environmental factors.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nSome possible explanations\n\nThere is no single explanation for why the world is becoming more allergic to food, but science has some theories.\n\nOne is that improved hygiene is to blame, as children are not getting as many infections.\n\nParasitic infections, in particular, are normally fought by the same mechanisms involved in tackling allergies. With fewer parasites to fight, the immune system turns against things that should be harmless.\n\nAnother idea is that vitamin D can help our immune system develop a healthy response, making us less susceptible to allergies. Most populations around the world do not get enough vitamin D for several reasons, including spending less time in the sun. In the US, the rate of vitamin D deficiency is thought to have almost doubled in just over a decade.\n\nA newer, \"dual allergen exposure\" theory, suggests food allergy development is down to the balance between the timing, dose and form of exposure.\n\nFor example, the development of the allergy antibodies can take place through the skin, particularly through inflamed skin in babies with eczema.\n\nBut it is thought that eating trigger foods during weaning can lead to a healthy response and prevent the allergy developing, because the gut's immune system is prepared to tolerate bacteria and foreign substances, such as food.\n\nThis was the basis for King's College London's LEAP Study, which showed about an 80% reduction in peanut allergy in five-year-old children who regularly ate peanut from the year they were born.\n\nThis study led to changes in US guidelines about peanut consumption in infancy. UK parents have been advised to consult their GP first.\n\nMore like this\n\nHuman impact\n\nThe recent deaths of UK teenagers suffering from food allergies highlight the human impact of this condition, and the importance of clear and accurate labelling.\n\nThere is currently no cure for food allergy, and managing the condition relies on avoiding the offending foods and on an emergency treatment plan in case of exposure.\n\nBut even making an initial diagnosis is challenging. The main way to identify food allergies is for a patient to gradually eat increased amounts of that food under medical supervision.\n\nHowever, this is distressing for children, and has the risk of causing an allergic reaction. The accompanying tests of their immune systems' reaction can also give a false positive in non-allergic children.\n\nImage copyright Thinkstock\n\nAt King's College London we have developed an alternative; a blood test which has proved accurate in diagnosing peanut allergy compared with existing methods.\n\nThese tests now cover the foods responsible for 90% of children's allergies, and will hopefully be available to patients in the next couple of years.\n\nEven following a successful diagnosis, avoiding trigger foods is difficult and accidental reactions are common.\n\nAllergen immunotherapy - administering small amounts of the substance - has been shown to reduce the sensitivity of allergic patients and can protect against accidental exposure.\n\nA recent immunotherapy drug trial found 67% of peanut-allergic subjects could consume the equivalent of two peanut kernels after a year, compared to 4% of the control group. Nevertheless, they are still allergic.\n\nOther treatments are being investigated for food allergy, and are much needed.\n\nIn the meantime, allergies will remain a source of worry and part of daily life for the children and their parents.\n\nAbout this piece\n\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.\n\nDr Alexandra Santos is a Senior Clinical Lecturer at the Department of Paediatric Allergy, King's College London.\n\nEdited by Eleanor Lawrie"

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nRepresentatives from nearly 200 countries are gathering in Poland for talks on climate change - aimed at breathing new life into the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe UN has warned the 2015 Paris accord's goal of limiting global warming to \"well below 2C above pre-industrial levels\" is in danger because major economies, including the US and the EU, are falling short of their pledges.\n\nBut scientists at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the leading international body on global warming - last month argued the 2C Paris pledge didn't go far enough. The global average temperature rise actually needed to be kept below 1.5C, they said.\n\nSo how warm has the world got and what can we do about it?\n\n1. The world has been getting hotter\n\nThe world is now nearly one degree warmer than it was before widespread industrialisation, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).\n\nThe global average temperature for the first 10 months of 2018 was 0.98C above the levels of 1850-1900, according to five independently maintained global data sets.\n\nHow years compare with the 20th Century average 2017 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Months J F M A M J J A S O N D Source: NOAA Replay\n\n(If you can't see this chart tap or click here)\n\nThe 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years, with 2015-2018 making up the top four, the WMO says.\n\nIf this trend continues, temperatures may rise by 3-5C by 2100.\n\nOne degree may not sound like much, but, according to the IPCC, if countries fail to act, the world will face catastrophic change - sea levels will rise, ocean temperatures and acidity will increase and our ability to grow crops, such as rice, maize and wheat, would be in danger.\n\n2. The year 2018 set all sorts of records\n\nThis year saw record high temperatures in many places across the world amid an unusually prolonged period of hot weather.\n\nLarge parts of the northern hemisphere saw a succession of heatwaves take hold in Europe, Asia, North America and northern Africa - a result of strong high pressure systems that created a \"heat dome\".\n\nOver the period shown on the map below (May to July 2018), the yellow dots show where a heat record was broken on a given date, pink indicates places that were the hottest they had ever been in the month shown, and dark red represents a place that was the hottest since records began.\n\nSorry, your browser cannot display this map\n\nThe concern is that such hot and cold weather fronts are being blocked - stuck over regions for long periods - more frequently because of climate change, leading to more extreme weather events.\n\n3. We are not on track to meet climate change targets\n\nIf we add up all the promises to cut emissions made by countries that have signed the Paris climate agreement, the world would still warm by more than 3C by the end of this century.\n\nOver the past three years, climate scientists have shifted the definition of what they believe is the \"safe\" limit of climate change.\n\nFor decades, researchers argued the global temperature rise must be kept below 2C by the end of this century to avoid the worst impacts.\n\nCountries signing up to the Paris agreement pledged to keep temperatures \"well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5C\".\n\nBut scientists now agree that we actually need to keep temperature rises to below 1.5C.\n\n4. The biggest emitters are China and the US\n\nThe countries emitting the most greenhouse gases by quite a long way are China and the US. Together they account for more than 40% of the global total, according to 2017 data from the European Commission's Joint Research Centre and PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.\n\nThe US's environmental policy has shifted under the Trump administration, which has pursued a pro-fossil fuels agenda.\n\nAfter taking office, President Donald Trump announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement.\n\nAt the time, Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new \"fair\" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers.\n\n5. Urban areas are particularly under threat\n\nAlmost all (95%) of cities facing extreme climate risks are in Africa or Asia, a report by risk analysts Verisk Maplecroft has found.\n\nAnd it's the faster-growing cities that are most at risk, including megacities like Lagos in Nigeria and Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nSome 84 of the world's 100 fastest-growing cities face \"extreme\" risks from rising temperatures and extreme weather brought on by climate change.\n\n6. Arctic sea ice is also in danger\n\nThe extent of Arctic sea ice has dropped in recent years. It reached its lowest point on record in 2012.\n\nSea ice has been reducing for decades, with melting accelerating since the early 2000s, according to the UK Parliament's Environmental Audit Committee.\n\nThe Arctic Ocean may be ice free in the summer as soon as the 2050s, unless emissions are reduced, the committee has said.\n\nThe WMO found the extent of Arctic sea ice in 2018 was much lower than normal, with the maximum in March the third lowest on record and the September minimum the sixth lowest.\n\n7. We can all do more to help\n\nWhile governments need to make big changes - individuals can play a role too.\n\nScientists say we all have to make \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes\" to our lifestyles, in order to avoid severely damaging climate change.\n\nThe IPCC says we need to: buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter; eat more locally sourced seasonal food - and throw less of it away; drive electric cars but walk or cycle short distances; take trains and buses instead of planes; use videoconferencing instead of business travel; use a washing line instead of a tumble dryer; insulate homes; demand low carbon in every consumer product.\n\nThe single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet is to modify your diet to include less meat - according to recent studies.\n\nScientists say we ought to eat less meat because of the carbon emissions the meat industry produces, as well as other negative environmental impacts.\n\nA recent study published in the journal Science highlighted a massive variation in the environmental impact of producing the same food.\n\nFor example, beef cattle raised on deforested land produces 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than those reared on natural pastures.\n\nCrucially, the analysis shows that meat with the lowest environmental impact still creates more greenhouse gas emissions than growing vegetables and cereal crops in the least environmentally-friendly way.\n\nBut as well as altering our diets, research suggests that farming practices need to change significantly to benefit the environment.\n\nBy Nassos Stylianou, Clara Guibourg, Daniel Dunford and Lucy Rodgers"

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Experts say former mine shafts could be used to grow food\n\nAbandoned coal mines across the UK could be brought back to life as huge underground farms, according to academics.\n\nMine shafts and tunnels are seen as \"the perfect environment\" for growing food such as vegetables and herbs.\n\nThe initiative is seen as a way of providing large-scale crop production for a growing global population.\n\nAdvocates say subterranean farms could yield up to ten times as much as farms above ground.\n\nPresident of the World Society of Sustainable Energy Technology, Prof Saffa Riffat, believes the scheme would be a cost-effective way of meeting the growing need for food.\n\nIt could also breathe new life into many mines that have been closed since the decline of the UK coal industry in the late 1980s and offer a cheaper alternative to vertical farming in giant greenhouses.\n\nImage copyright University of Nottingham Image caption How it would work\n\nThe idea has already gained support from mine owners, including the Land Trust and Coal Authority, while the Chinese government has also expressed an interest.\n\nThere are an estimated 150,000 abandoned shafts and 25,000km-sq of disused mines and tunnels in the UK.\n\n\"I'm very excited about the enormous potential. Rather than import so much food by air, rail and sea, we could grow a lot of it here and in huge quantities,\" said Prof Riffat.\n\n\"I wish I had thought of this idea when they were making all the miners redundant. We may have been able to offer them an alternative job.\"\n\nSo what are underground farms, and how would they work?\n\nA problem solved?\n\nBy all predictions, global population will continue to grow with the figure in the UK set to reach 80 million before the end of the century, according to the United Nations.\n\nIncreasingly, people are opting to live in cities rather than rural areas, putting a strain on food production and land space.\n\n\"We have a major issue with food production and supply with the world's population expected to reach nine billion by 2050,\" said Prof Riffat, of University of Nottingham.\n\n\"We need to do this for our future. We have a growing demand for food, especially in the cities, but less space to grow it.\"\n\nImage copyright Zero Carbon Food Image caption Richard Ballard (left) and Steven Dring grow food in a former air-raid tunnel in London\n\nWhy tunnels?\n\nA former World War Two air-raid shelter 100ft (30.5m) under Clapham Common, London, is already being used to grow greens for local supermarkets and restaurants.\n\nUnlike current agriculture, farming underground is unaffected by irregular seasons, climate change and the extreme weather witnessed throughout 2018.\n\nAlmost all the ingredients needed for growing crops such as lettuces, carrots, mushrooms and strawberries are already in place.\n\nThe air temperature and humidity levels are generally temperate and constant while there is a ready water supply as well as carbon dioxide.\n\n\"Tunnels and shafts would need less energy with heating, so are very attractive for food production. They're almost perfect,\" said Prof Riffat.\n\nHow would it work?\n\nCrops would either be grown in water or suspended in the air and sprayed with water and nutrients.\n\nLighting would either be from LED lights which are now \"extremely cheap to buy and run\" or fibre-optic technology which can tunnel sunlight up to 40 metres into the ground.\n\nCarbon-capture technology would capitalise on the naturally occurring CO2.\n\nImage copyright University of Nottingham\n\nIs it viable?\n\nCurrently, mass-producing crops requires large areas of land.\n\nHowever one 7m-sq shaft can produce 80 tonnes of food per year, according to Prof Riffat, approximately eight to 10 times the amount of food grown on the same area of land above ground.\n\n\"You're looking at about \u00a330,000 to set up one shaft and the running costs are very low - less than the energy consumed by three houses each year. With natural sunlight, the costs are even less.\"\n\nWhat has been the reaction?\n\nThe Land Trust owns and manages many former colliery sites that have been converted into public spaces.\n\n\"It's a great idea and one that we have previously considered ourselves,\" said chief executive Euan Hall.\n\n\"There are obvious challenges, not least that many shafts have been capped or have been built on, but there are lots of coalfields where there's no community around them, where this is clearly something worth looking at.\n\n\"A lot of hill farmers in Wales are living hand to mouth so anything that helps diversity and brings a new form of income would be very welcome.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Coal Authority said it was \"open to considering new ideas\" as part of its innovation strategy.\n\nHe added: \"As an organisation, we constantly review new ways to develop our mining legacy in an effort to minimise remediation costs, generate income from by products and create a future for these important and unique areas.\n\n\"Any schemes involving former coal mines would inevitably throw up many technical, legal and financial challenges that would need to be overcome.\""

    "authors": [

    ],
    "text": "Along with old classics like \u2018carrots give you night vision\u2019 and \u2018Santa doesn\u2019t bring toys to misbehaving children\u2019, one of the most well-worn phrases in the arsenal of tired parents everywhere is that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Many of us grow up believing that skipping breakfast is a dietary travesty \u2013 even if only two thirds of adults in the UK eat breakfast regularly, according to the Association of UK Dieticians (BDA), and around three-quarters of Americans.\n\nThe clue for why breakfast is supposed to be important is in its name: we\u2019re advised to eat it to break our overnight fast.\n\n\u201cThe body uses a lot of energy stores for growth and repair through the night,\u201d explains dietician Sarah Elder. \u201cEating a balanced breakfast helps to up our energy, as well as protein and calcium used throughout the night.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s widespread disagreement over whether breakfast should keep its top spot in the hierarchy of meals. As well as the rising popularity of fasting diets, there have been concerns around the sugar content of cereal and the food industry\u2019s involvement in pro-breakfast research \u2013 and even one claim from an academic that breakfast is \u201cdangerous\u201d.\n\nSo what\u2019s the reality? Is breakfast a necessary start to the day\u2026 or a marketing ploy by cereal companies?\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 Is sugar really bad for you?\n\n\u2022 We don\u2019t need nearly as much protein as we consume\n\n\u2022 Is having a low-salt diet as unhealthy as too much?\n\nWeighty decision\n\nThe most researched aspect of breakfast (and breakfast-skipping) has been its links to obesity. Scientists have different theories as to why there\u2019s a relationship between the two.\n\nIn one US study that analysed the health data of 50,000 people over seven years, researchers found that those who made breakfast the largest meal of the day were more likely to have a lower body mass index (BMI) than those who ate a large lunch or dinner. The researchers argued that breakfast helps increase satiety, reduce daily calorie intake, improve the quality of our diet \u2013 since breakfast foods are often higher in fibre and nutrients \u2013 and improve insulin sensitivity at subsequent meals, which can be a risk for diabetes.\n\nBut as with any study of this kind, it was unclear if that was the cause \u2013 or if breakfast-skippers were just more likely to be overweight to begin with.\n\nTo find out, researchers designed a study in which 52 obese women took part in a 12-week weight loss programme. All had the same number of calories over the day, but half had breakfast, while the other half did not.\n\nWhat they found was that it wasn\u2019t breakfast itself that caused the participants to lose weight: it was changing their normal routine. The women who said before the study that they usually ate breakfast lost 8.9kg when they stopped having breakfast, compared to 6.2kg in the breakfast group. Meanwhile, those who usually skipped breakfast lost 7.7kg when they started eating it \u2013 and 6kg when they continued to skip it.\n\nIf breakfast alone isn\u2019t a guarantee of weight loss, why is there a link between obesity and skipping breakfast?\n\nAlexandra Johnstone, professor of appetite research at the University of Aberdeen, argues that it may simply be because breakfast-skippers have been found to be less knowledgeable about nutrition and health.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of studies on the relationship between breakfast eating and possible health outcomes, but this may be because those who eat breakfast choose to habitually have health-enhancing behaviours such as not smoking and regular exercise,\u201d she says.\n\nOne review found 'limited evidence' either for or against the argument that breakfast influences weight\n\nA 2016 review of 10 studies looking into the relationship between breakfast and weight management concluded there is \u201climited evidence\u201d supporting or refuting the argument that breakfast influences weight or food intake, and more evidence is required before breakfast recommendations can be used to help prevent obesity.\n\nFeast or fast?\n\nIntermittent fasting, which involves fasting overnight and into the next day, is gaining ground among those looking to lose or maintain their weight or improve their health.\n\nOne pilot study published in 2018, for example, found that intermittent fasting improves blood sugar control and insulin sensitivity and lowers blood pressure. Eight men with pre-diabetes were assigned one of two eating schedules: either eating all their calories between 9:00 and 15:00, or eating the same number of calories over 12 hours. The results for the 9:00-15:00 group were found to be on par with medicine that lowers blood pressure, according to Courtney Peterson, the study\u2019s author and assistant professor of nutrition sciences at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\nStill, the study\u2019s small size means more research is needed on its possible long-term benefits.\n\nIf skipping breakfast (and other food outside of a restricted time slot) could potentially be good for you, does that mean breakfast could be bad for you? One academic has said so, arguing that breakfast is \u2018dangerous\u2019: eating early in the day causes our cortisol to peak more than it does later on. This causes the body to become resistant to insulin over time and can lead to type 2 diabetes.\n\nBut Fredrik Karpe, professor of metabolic medicine at Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, argues this isn\u2019t the case. Instead, higher levels of cortisol in the morning are just part of our body\u2019s natural rhythm.\n\nNot only that, but breakfast is key to jumpstarting our metabolism, he says. \u201cIn order for other tissues to respond well to food intake, you need an initial trigger involving carbs responding to insulin. Breakfast is critical for this to happen,\u201d Karpe says.\n\nA randomised control trial published last year involving 18 people with, and 18 people without, diabetes found that skipping breakfast disrupted the circadian rhythms of both groups and led to larger spikes in blood glucose levels after eating. Eating breakfast, the researchers conclude, is essential for keeping our body clock running on time.\n\nPeterson says those who skip breakfast can be divided into those who either skip breakfast and eat dinner at a normal time \u2013 getting the benefits of intermittent fasting, if not breakfast \u2013 or those who skip breakfast and eat dinner late.\n\nWhile it seems breakfast is the most important meal of the day, it might actually be dinner \u2013 Courtney Peterson\n\n\u201cFor those who eat dinner later, their risk of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease goes through the roof. While it seems breakfast is the most important meal of the day, it might actually be dinner,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cOur blood sugar control is best early in the day. When we eat dinner late, that\u2019s when we\u2019re most vulnerable because our blood sugar is worst. There\u2019s more research to do, but I\u2019m confident you shouldn\u2019t skip breakfast and have dinner late.\u201d\n\nShe says we should think of our circadian rhythm as an orchestra.\n\n\u201cThere are two parts of our circadian clock. There\u2019s the master clock in the brain, which we should think of as analogous to a conductor of an orchestra, and the other half is in every organ, which has a separate clock,\u201d she says.\n\nAnd that \u2018orchestra\u2019 is set by two outside factors: bright light exposure and our eating schedule.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re eating when you\u2019re not getting bright light exposure, the clocks that control metabolism are in different time zones, creating conflicting signals as to whether to rev up or down.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s like two halves of an orchestra playing different songs, Peterson explains, and this is why eating late impairs blood sugar and blood pressure levels.\n\nResearchers from the University of Surrey and University of Aberdeen are halfway through research looking into the mechanisms behind how the time we eat influences body weight. Early findings suggest that a bigger breakfast is beneficial to weight control.\n\nHealth food\n\nBreakfast has been found to affect more than just weight. Skipping breakfast has been associated with a 27% increased risk of heart disease, a 21% higher risk of type 2 diabetes in men, and a 20% higher risk of type 2 diabetes in women.\n\nOne reason may be breakfast\u2019s nutritional value \u2013 partly because cereal is fortified with vitamins. In one study on the breakfast habits of 1,600 young people in the UK, researchers found that the fibre and micronutrient intake, including of folate, vitamin C iron and calcium, was better in those who had breakfast regularly. There have been similar findings in Australia, Brazil, Canada and the US.\n\nBreakfast is also associated with improved brain function, including concentration and language. A review of 54 studies found that eating breakfast can improve memory, though the effects on other brain functions were inconclusive. However, one of the review\u2019s researchers, Mary Beth Spitznagel, says there is \u201creasonable\u201d evidence breakfast does improve concentration \u2013 there just needs to be more research.\n\n\u201cLooking at studies that tested concentration, the number of studies showing a benefit was exactly the same as the number that found no benefit,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cAnd no studies found that eating breakfast was bad for concentration.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s most important, some argue, is what we eat for breakfast.\n\nHigh-protein breakfasts have been found particularly effective in reducing food cravings and consumption later in the day, according to research by the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.\n\nSome cereals contain more than three quarters of the recommended daily amount\n\nWhile cereal remains a firm favourite among breakfast consumers in the UK and US, a recent Which? investigation into the sugar content of \u2018adult\u2019 breakfast cereals found that some cereals contain more than three quarters of the recommended daily amount of free sugars in each portion, and sugar was the second or third highest ingredient in seven out of 10 flaked cereals.\n\nBut some research suggests if we\u2019re going to eat sugary foods, it\u2019s best to do it early. One study found that changing levels of the appetite hormone leptin in the body throughout the day coincide with having our lowest threshold for sweet food in a morning, while scientists from Tel Aviv University have found that hunger is best regulated in the morning. They recruited 200 obese adults to take part in a 16-week-long diet, where half added dessert to their breakfast, and half didn\u2019t. Those who added dessert lost an average of 40lbs (18kg) more \u2013 however, the study was unable to show the long-term effects.\n\nA review of 54 studies found that there is no consensus yet on what type of breakfast is healthier, and conclude that the type of breakfast doesn\u2019t matter as much as simply eating something.\n\nFinal take\n\nWhile there\u2019s no conclusive evidence on exactly what we should be eating and when, the consensus is that we should listen to our own bodies and eat when we\u2019re hungry.\n\nBreakfast is most important for people who are hungry when they wake up \u2013 Alexandra Johnstone\n\n\u201cBreakfast is most important for people who are hungry when they wake up,\u201d Johnstone says.\n\nFor instance, research shows that those with pre-diabetes and diabetes may find they have better concentration after a lower-GI breakfast such as porridge, which is broken down more slowly and causes a more gradual rise in blood sugar levels.\n\nEvery body starts the day differently \u2013 and those individual differences, particularly in glucose function, need to be researched more closely, Spitznagel says.\n\nIn the end, the key may be to be mindful of not over-emphasising any single meal, but rather looking at how we eat all day long.\n\nBreakfast isn\u2019t the only meal we should be getting right \u2013 Sarah Elder\n\n\u201cA balanced breakfast is really helpful, but getting regular meals throughout the day is more important to leave blood sugar stable through day, that helps control weight and hunger levels,\u201d says Elder.\n\n\u201cBreakfast isn\u2019t the only meal we should be getting right.\u201d\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

(But, as I said just a moment ago, you won't.)\n\nHow is this ethical or even legal?\n\nImage copyright Sarah Brimley Image caption BBC reporter Tulip Mazumdar underwent airbrushing for 100 Women in 2013\n\nIt's bad for the person being photographed\n\nIf you see a digitally \"enhanced\" picture of yourself, you run the risk of becoming acclimatised to that level of flawlessness and it makes it harder for you to accept your actual image - the one that exists in real life, in the mirror.\n\nYou then might want to take measures to match what is achieved on the screen.\n\nOften this is only achievable with expensive, painful and often risky cosmetic procedures or surgery.\n\nFilters and digital editing have almost certainly contributed to the fact so many of the women I know have turned to needles, knives and extreme diets to try to match their online avatar.\n\nWhen photo editors try to lighten my skin and change my ethnicity, it's bad for the girls who are looking at the picture. But it's also bad for my mental health.\n\nIt makes me dislike what I'm seeing in the mirror. It's a message from the editor to me that I am not good enough as I am.\n\nIt's so, so bad for the public, especially young women\n\nPeople don't realise the image they are looking at has been airbrushed (and let's face it, almost nobody owns up to the fact it has).\n\nAdmissions to hospitals for severe eating disorders have almost doubled over the last six years, NHS figures showed earlier this year. Two-thirds of teenage girls and young women don't think they're pretty enough. And 93% think they're judged on their appearance more than their ability.\n\nAt one point, while presenting the Official Chart Show on BBC Radio 1, I gained 200,000 listeners which was great. But instead of telling that story, that same day the newspapers reported that I'd gained two dress sizes and printed loads of photographs fat-shaming me and ridiculing my body.\n\nMeanwhile the beauty and cosmetic procedure industries are booming, the diet industry is at an all-time high, and social media filters and photo editing apps have emerged.\n\nWhen you filter a woman's photo you are legitimising the patriarchy's absurd aesthetic standards, that women should be attractive to the straight, male gaze at all costs. When you filter your selfies, you are doing the same thing.\n\nIn contrast, we shoot men in high definition on magazine covers. But for them, the inevitable lines of age are a sign of distinction and rugged attractiveness.\n\nMen are allowed to wear baggy clothes to cover their bellies and they aren't subjected to couture modelled by emaciated 16-year-olds on runways.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Jameela with D'Arcy Carden and Kristen Bell, her co-stars on The Good Place\n\nMen get a green light on ageing and gravity. Why can't women get the same allowances?\n\nIt is anti-feminist. It is ageist. It is fat-phobic. It looks weird. It looks wrong. It's robbing you of your time, money, comfort, integrity and self worth. Delete the apps and unfollow those who are complicit in this crime against our gender.\n\nWe need to see spots. We need to see wrinkles. We need to see cellulite and stretch marks. If not, we will become almost allergic to the sight of them, even though we all have these things on our own bodies. We need to be honest with ourselves and with each other so that we can all be free.\n\nDon't give your money to any institution that sells you the lie of 'perfection'. They are trying to break you, so you will hate yourself and go out and buy something you don't need, in order to fix something that was never broken in the first place.\n\nSee who is on our 2018 BBC 100 Women list.\n\nFollow BBC 100 Women on Instagram and Facebook and join the conversation.\n\nRead more:"

    "text": "Image copyright Mike Tinmouth Image caption Mike Tinmouth says the fraudsters were convincing\n\nA bank customer was tricked into transferring money by fraudsters who pretended to be responding to his angry Twitter post about poor service.\n\nWriter Mike Tinmouth was furious with the process and time taken to open a business account with Barclays.\n\nHe expressed his frustration in a public tweet - which was seized on by fraudsters who posed as the bank in an attempt to trick him out of \u00a38,000.\n\nFraud experts say con-artists are becoming skilled at impersonation.\n\n'Lulled into paying'\n\nMr Tinmouth wanted to open a business account to deal with the income and expenditure of some properties that he was letting to tenants.\n\nHe applied to Barclays, but the process dragged on and eventually he made a complaint on Twitter.\n\nHe even posted an email that he received from the bank which he felt was unprofessional and had to confirm was genuine. The bank urged him to delete this public post.\n\nAll this information, together with some personal details that were already available about him online, was enough for fraudsters to mimic the bank and appear to know details of the case.\n\n\"They targeted me because they are monitoring the big banks' customer support Twitter channels where they can get enough information on name, location, and photo to then be able to track down further information,\" he said.\n\nSoon after the Twitter exchange, he received another email apologising for the poor service and offering to deal with his case. This time the message was from a fraudster posing as his bank.\n\nAfter various exchanges, he was provided with details of his \"new\" account, and he started to transfer money from his personal current account with a different bank.\n\nThe transfer was blocked, saving Mr Tinmouth from losing the \u00a38,000 he intended to move between the two accounts.\n\nBarclays said that customers should always be careful about posting details in public, and that it had a system of ensuring customers dealt with the bank's social media teams on private channels. No-one should transfer money to a new account without having all the relevant paperwork and full control of the account, a spokesman added.\n\n\"In this case, we advised Mr Tinmouth on the process he should follow to speak to us about his query. However while we were in contact, he engaged with an unverified email address and provided personal information to scammers, which led to him being targeted,\" a spokesman said.\n\nKaty Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance, which represents the major banks, said that criminals would try to impersonate legitimate organisations, such as banks, police, utility companies or retailers. They would contact potential victims through social media applications in an attempt to trick them into giving away their details.\n\n\"Always question any phone calls, texts, tweets or emails out of the blue asking for your personal information in case it is a scam, and never automatically click on any links,\" she said.\n\n\"Instead contact the company directly on a known phone number or email, such as the one on their official website. If you think your personal or financial information may have been stolen, contact your bank straight away and also report it to Action Fraud.\"\n\nNames matter\n\nThe attempt to trick Mr Tinmouth happened in the same week that plans were confirmed for a new system aimed at reducing fraud.\n\nThe Payment Systems Regulator has now opened consultation into the proposal to ensure than a recipient's name is checked, along with their account number and sort code when transferring money.\n\nHow Confirmation of Payee will work\n\nWhen setting up a new payment, or amending an existing one, banks will be able to check the name on the account of the person or organisation you are paying.\n\nIf you use the correct account name, you will receive confirmation that the details match, and can proceed with the payment\n\nIf you use a similar name to the account holder, you will be provided with the actual name of the account holder to check. You can update the details and try again, or contact the intended recipient to check the details\n\nIf you enter the wrong name for the account holder you will be told the details do not match and advised to contact the person or organisation you are trying to pay\n\nThis process would have stopped Mr Tinmouth earlier in the process, as he would have realised that the destination account was not his own, but in the name of somebody else entirely.\n\nOther victims of fraud may also have been stopped from transferring money had they realised the account holder they were paying was wrong.\n\nGareth Shaw, from consumer group Which?, said the change - which would take effect \"early\" in 2019 - was long overdue.\n\n\"Customers will question why it's taken their bank so long to implement a system that could have prevented devastating financial losses years ago,\" he said.\n\n\"To halt the alarming rise in bank transfer scams we must now see swift implementation of this much-needed measure across the board.\""

There are presents to buy, Christmas outings and parties to shell out for and on top of that there's the traditional yuletide lunch.\n\nThe cost of festive nibbles, fancy side dishes, the turkey, cake, pudding and alcohol all add up, especially if you're hosting extended family and friends, as well as your immediate family.\n\nAnd that's before you account for the stress and extra work involved in cooking such a large meal.\n\nCould charging guests for their meal be one way to cope?\n\nWhen a user on parenting forum Mumsnet said her mother-in-law had decided to charge her family \u00a317-a-head to attend this year's Christmas dinner it sparked a mixed response.\n\nSome thought it was fair enough given the cost, while others said it simply wasn't in keeping with the season's spirit of togetherness and generosity.\n\nImage copyright Kimberly Bree Image caption Kimberly Bree, pictured (third from left) with some of her family, says they all share the cost of Christmas lunch\n\nKimberly Bree, a project manager from Canterbury, is one of six siblings and has nine nieces and nephews. In total, when the whole family get together there are 23 of them.\n\nOne of her sisters has a house large enough to occasionally host the entire group for Christmas, but Kimberly says once alcohol, the trimmings and snacks are included the bill can run into the hundreds of pounds.\n\nShe says there's no way the family would let her sister pay.\n\n\"We always suggest that the host buys and cooks and asks for help, and also lets us know what the cost shared between us is.\n\n\"Given the spirit of Christmas I think it would be rather horrible of us to do anything other than share the cost out,\" she says.\n\nBut she points out that \"sharing costs\" has a different connotation to \"charging\" and says her family's approach is about \"not wanting to overburden the host\" rather than \"telling people they owe you money\".\n\nGeorgie Anderson, a marketing assistant in London, also says she'd be happy to contribute some money for a Christmas dinner, and like many of us would rather pay than do it herself.\n\n\"I see it less as being 'charged' than paying my part. Plus, making Christmas dinner is a bit of a palaver,\" she says.\n\n'Absurd'\n\nYet asking friends or family to contribute financially for Christmas is a touchy topic.\n\nWhen I asked people on social media what they thought of the idea, most were firmly opposed.\n\n\"Staggered\", \"the most absurd holiday thing I've ever heard of\" and \"a great way to reduce the number of people you have to cook for to zero\" were some of the responses.\n\n\"Then why invite them? Tell everyone Christmas is cancelled,\" said Samantha.\n\nThere's no doubt that some people do do it, though.\n\nDaniella told the BBC that her mother-in-law charged \u00a340 a head a few years ago, but they allowed her then nine-year-old son to eat for free.\n\n\"I was so shocked and we did pay it but we haven't been for dinner since and don't think we will,\" she says.\n\nMyles says his mum charges the whole family \u00a310-a-head and asks them to bring their own vegetables and gravy. \"I personally don't mind paying because service includes washing up but it's divided the family for many years.\"\n\nThe authority on etiquette and behaviour, Debretts, the publisher of the A-Z of Modern Manners, is unequivocal that charging guests is unacceptable.\n\n\"You have invited them to your home, and it therefore isn't appropriate to expect them to contribute monetarily to the cost of your dinner,\" says managing director Renee Kuo.\n\nBut she adds that family accepting invitations also have a responsibility to be good guests, and can't simply relax to the point where we forget good manners - as many of us do when we return home for the holidays.\n\nImage copyright Debretts Image caption Asking for financial contributions isn't appropriate says Debretts' Renee Kuo\n\nGood guests should bring a bottle or something to contribute and should also offer to help out. And good hosts, she suggests, shouldn't be martyrs and must feel free to accept offers of contributions and even suggest a particular side, main, pudding or drink.\n\nShe is adamant, however, that mentioning cold, hard cash is simply not on.\n\n\"Asking them to pay, however, is a step too far. Consider booking a set Christmas meal at a local restaurant instead,\" she suggests.\n\nImage copyright Delicious Image caption When people ask if they can bring anything, say YES, says Delicious editor Karen Barnes\n\nKaren Barnes, editor of monthly food magazine Delicious, agrees, saying asking people to pay would \"feel wrong somehow\".\n\nShe points out that the standard response when you're invited to any kind of gathering is: Is there anything I can bring?\n\n\"That's the perfect opportunity to say YES,'' she says.\n\n\"My suggestion would be to ask people if they'd be happy to bring something, like the fizz to start the meal or perhaps the stuffings and a pudding.\n\n\"That's what we do in our family - everyone makes a practical (rather than a monetary) contribution and it works really well.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The cost of Christmas lunch with all the trimmings can quickly add up\n\nBut there's no getting away from the high cost of Christmas.\n\nThe typical family spends a whopping \u00a3750 on Christmas each year, according to Steve Nowottny, news and features editor at MoneySavingExpert.\n\n\"Throw in the pressure of catering for extended family too and it's little wonder rows can erupt,\" he says.\n\nHe believes people often feel too much pressure to live up to an idealised image of Christmas and spend more than they can afford.\n\nHis advice on keeping costs down is to work out a budget and stick to it, switching to cheaper brands when you do the big Christmas food shop if necessary.\n\nYet when it comes to the question of charging or not, he sits firmly on the fence.\n\n\"Who pays for what is ultimately down to each family,\" he says diplomatically."

    "authors": [
      "Cath Pound"
    ],
    "text": "Fin-de-si\u00e8cle Paris was known as the city of pleasure, famed for its cabarets and dance halls. In an era that embraced the cult of the individual, venue managers increasingly saw the advantage of promoting star acts, causing singers, dancers and actors to seek opportunities for personal promotion. Many turned to the new medium of the poster and its most talented interpreter, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. His strikingly innovative designs turned artistes such as Aristide Bruant, Jane Avril and Yvette Guilbert into household names, heralding the birth of celebrity culture as we know it and making a star of their creator in the process.\n\nToulouse-Lautrec was drawn to the bohemian milieu of Montmartre as a means of escaping his stifling home environment, where his stunted legs, the result of a rare bone disease, had frequently made him feel like an outsider. Among artists and performers he finally found acceptance and threw himself into the decadent nightlife with great enthusiasm. He became a regular at many of the leading nightspots where he would sit and avidly sketch the acts. Noted for his kind-heartedness, loyalty and charm he also \u201cgained a reputation quite early for someone who drank anything,\u201d says Hannah Brocklehurst, curator of Pin-ups: Toulouse-Lautrec and the Art of Celebrity at the Scottish National Gallery.\n\nHis arrival in Paris coincided with one of the most exciting periods in the history of Western printmaking. Jules Cher\u00e9t, \u2018the father of the poster,\u2019 had revolutionised the medium\u2019s use of colour by bringing the first large lithographic printing presses to Paris. Avant-garde artists had swiftly embraced the new technology, sparking a printmaking and collecting boom.\n\nAt the same time, a relaxing of laws restricting the posting of publicity materials allowed a new breed of entrepreneurial venue manager to adapt the new artistic form as a means of advertising, turning the streets of Paris into a veritable art gallery.\n\nFriends in high places\n\nLautrec\u2019s big break came in 1891 when Charles Zidler, manager of the legendary Moulin Rouge, asked him to design a poster. Cher\u00e9t himself had created the first poster for the venue two years earlier. His playful design with its bright colours and pretty, Rococo-inspired women was certainly eye-catching but gave no indication of the individuality of the performers.\n\nLautrec gave the Moulin Rouge\u2019s most famous dancers centre stage, portraying them in pared-down, flattened forms and bold black outlines inspired by Japanese prints. The muddy, acidic palette perfectly encapsulated the combination of decadence and delight that could be found within the venue.\n\n\u201cIt is more than certain that I owe him the fame I enjoyed dating from his first poster of me\u201d \u2013 Jane Avril\n\nHis intimate knowledge of the performers enabled Lautrec to capture their essence in a few brief strokes. La Goulue (the glutton), a nickname derived from her habit of quickly downing customers\u2019 drinks, is shown swirling her skirts in the middle of the can-can while her partner Valentin le D\u00e9soss\u00e9 (the boneless) dominates the foreground performing one of his sinuous trademark moves.\n\n\u201cWhen the streets are lined with posters, an individual poster really has to stand out,\u201d says Brocklehurst. And Toulouse-Lautrec\u2019s stunningly innovative image certainly did that. There had simply been nothing like it before. \u201cThe contemporary accounts of people seeing it in the street were that it had a sort of uncomfortableness about it. It was so strange but people seemed to like that,\u201d Brocklehurst adds.\n\nThree thousand copies of the poster were pasted across Paris, causing an instant sensation and turning Toulouse-Lautrec into a star virtually overnight.\n\nHe broke new ground once again in his poster for Le Divan Japonais, a short-lived venue noted for its Oriental decor. The primary focus is on the figures of the dancer Jane Avril and the music critic \u00c9douard Dujardin seated in the audience, immediately suggesting that this is the place to be seen.\n\nIn a daring innovation he crops the head of the figure on stage, knowing that the long black gloves would identify her as the singer Yvette Guilbert, a neat trick which not only acknowledged the power of her trademark but also the public\u2019s ability to recognise it.\n\n\u201cPart of the appeal of these nightclubs and performers was their quirkiness,\u201d says Brocklehurst. \u201cThey weren\u2019t generic types. They all had their own personality and their own trademarks and people liked that. He grasped that concept.\u201d\n\nSoon after, Avril commissioned her first poster from Toulouse-Lautrec. One of the biggest stars of the era and an icon of Montmartre, she intuitively recognised the potential for poster-driven fame, and assiduously built her personal brand around it. \u201cIt is more than certain that I owe him the fame I enjoyed dating from his first poster of me,\u201d she later wrote.\n\nAvril became a close personal friend, even acting as hostess at the artist\u2019s famed dinner parties. He was a fine cook and hospitable host and certainly enjoyed socialising with the celebrities of the day. He undoubtedly realised that the stardust that rubbed off on him was highly beneficial in terms of career and self promotion but also genuinely felt that these were his people.\n\nThe invention of celebrity\n\nAnd they certainly felt an affinity with him. Yvette Guilbert appeared in Toulouse-Lautrec\u2019s work more than any other performer, gracing song sheets, individual collector\u2019s prints and two books of lithographs. The first of these caused a sensation as there was no precedent for producing an artist\u2019s book dedicated to a single artist. The album was produced in a limited edition of 100, signed by both Guilbert and Toulouse-Lautrec, making it one of the earliest examples of celebrity memorabilia.\n\nBut perhaps her loyalty to his unique depictions of her went a little too far. La Vie Parisienne complained in October 1894 that she was becoming \u201cmore and more like an impression of a poster, with hair that is too yellow, lips that are too red, gloves that are too black, a belt that is too green\u201d.\n\nThe singer and poet Aristide Bruant was another performer \u201cdescribed as walking round like a living poster,\u201d says Brocklehurst. His trademark outfit of soft black hat, cape and red scarf flung dramatically over his shoulder was certainly one that cried out to be reproduced. But the image that has become one of Toulouse-Lautrec\u2019s most iconic almost didn\u2019t appear. The management of Les Ambassadeurs disliked the poster, considering it too unorthodox, and Bruant had to threaten not to perform in order to force them to change their mind. Having won his hand Bruant then had the poster plastered across Paris causing one journalist to exclaim \u201cwho will deliver us from this image of Aristide Bruant? You can\u2019t take a step without finding yourself face to face with it,\u201d proving early on that there is such a thing as too much publicity.\n\nNoted for his kind-heartedness, loyalty and charm he also \u201cgained a reputation quite early for someone who drank anything\u201d\n\nLautrec continued to produce innovative work but his debauched lifestyle, particularly his love of absinthe, eventually started to take its toll, and in 1897 he began showing signs of alcoholism. A bout of delirium saw him institutionalised and in the summer of 1901 his mother brought him home to her estate where he suffered a stroke and died. He was only 36.\n\nTragically, while helping to invent celebrity culture, Lautrec was also to become one of its earliest casualties. However, thanks to his extraordinary talent, the images of those he helped to promote have become emblematic of an era enabling their fame to live on while so many who followed in their wake have been forgotten.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

It is less common in women who have been through the menopause\n\nIt is a long-term condition that can have a significant impact on your life, but there are treatments that can help\n\nSymptoms include: Pain in your lower tummy or back (pelvic pain) - usually worse during your period; pain when going to the toilet during your period; feeling sick, constipation, diarrhoea, or blood in your urine during your period; difficulty getting pregnant\n\nFor some women, endometriosis can have a big impact on their life and may sometimes lead to feelings of depression\n\nDiagnosis and surgery\n\nMs Roach had surgery following the diagnosis.\n\n\"Half of my left side of my organs had all fused together [because of scarring and adhesions]. I had cysts, I had internal bleeding. I had all kinds of things going on that I didn't anticipate,\" she said.\n\nShe had a second surgery for gallstone and gall bladder removal after problems caused by hormones she was taking, and a third after her pain recurred.\n\nDespite having the diagnosis, five GPs had said there was no underlying physical cause and it was only when she paid for a private scan that a large cyst was found and removed.\n\nImage copyright Alex Roach Image caption Alex Roach has undergone three operations due to the condition\n\nMs Roach, a member of the Fair Treatment for the Women of Wales group whose research led to the Welsh Government investigation, said it was vital there was greater understanding of the impact the disease had on the lives of the one-in-10 women it affected.\n\nShe missed lectures in university, had to sit exams shortly after surgery and had to scale down her hopes of getting a first-class degree. She was also told the condition had affected her chances of promotion at work.\n\nShe also knows she is likely to need surgery in the future and does not know how her chances of having children will be affected, adding her partner had \"been to hell and back with me\".\n\n\"There needs to be a recognition that there isn't enough being done to recognise and diagnose the disease. It's horrendous being in pain but it's even worse when you have no idea why,\" Ms Roach said.\n\n\"It's the leading cause for infertility and it would make a huge difference to my life, to so many different women's lives, if diagnosis could happen earlier and the damage prevented and the fertility preserved.\"\n\nThe report found current provision across all levels of service from GPs to specialists was not meeting need, and a lack of understanding of the condition led to delays in diagnosis, poor management of symptoms and negative outcomes for patients.\n\nThe report makes a number of proposals, including:\n\nEarly education in menstrual well-being from primary school age onwards and timely response to symptoms by GPs, with onwards referral for further investigation with an endometriosis specialist gynaecologist if necessary\n\nEach health board in Wales should identify one or more endometriosis consultant leads and provide a specialist nurse. At present there is only one such nurse in the whole of Wales, in Cardiff's specialist endometriosis centre, and three specialist consultants\n\nDebbie Shaffer founded Fair Treatment for Women in Wales (FTWW) after suffering from endometriosis herself for 26 years before being diagnosed.\n\nShe fought for over two years to get treatment in Liverpool as there was no endometriosis specialist where she lived in north Wales.\n\n\"Women were having inadequate treatment locally, repeatedly, year on year,\" she said.\n\nMs Schaffer set up FTWW, initially via a Facebook page, after working with Cardiff University to survey women across Wales to get their experiences.\n\nShe wrote a report from the results which she sent to the Welsh Government and the head of NHS Wales.\n\nThis prompted the creation of a task and finish group, with Ms Schaffer on the panel, which produced the Endometriosis Care in Wales report."

And the name, \"painted wolves\", seems so apt.\n\nTheir dappled tan and black fur, shot through with flashes of white, dazzles in the sunlight.\n\nYou're going to become very familiar with these creatures; you may even fall in love with them, because they will feature in David Attenborough's new blockbuster TV series, Dynasties.\n\nThe BBC spent months filming the endangered African wild dogs of Mana Pools National Park in Zimbabwe, and wildlife photographer Nick Dyer says viewers will be enthralled by the result.\n\nImage copyright \u00a9Nicholas Dyer Image caption On the prowl: The animals are now officially classed as Endangered\n\nThe former London fund manager and marketing executive now dedicates his time and his camera to promoting the animals' conservation, walking with three packs as they roam the floodplain of the Zambezi River.\n\n\"During the day, they're mostly asleep but when they wake up, they leap and dance with absolute joy,\" he tells me. \"They have this great social bonding thing we call a greeting ceremony. They're so full of play, especially with their pups, so they're always chasing and pulling each other's tails, which is really great fun to watch.\"\n\nThe first thing you need to know about painted wolves is that they're not wolves, nor, as their more boring name suggests, are they dogs.\n\nImage copyright \u00a9Nicholas Dyer Image caption Echo: The dogs swivel their big ears to hear what's going on even at great distance\n\nSome readers may find the next image distressing\n\nThey're in a separate evolutionary group from these more familiar canids. Lycaon pictus is their scientific name, which means something like \"painted wolf-like\".\n\nBut they certainly behave much like wolves and dogs. Lots of movement and lots of noise.\n\n\"They have several calls, but perhaps the most endearing sound they make is the hoo call,\" explains Nick.\n\n\"If they get separated from the pack, they put their head low and make this 'hoo, hoo' noise, which is an incredibly haunting sound, but that sound can travel up to 2km and with their big ears they can pick it up, and that reunites the pack.\"\n\nWhisper it quietly, they're also just a bit smelly. Nick recalls watching one animal regurgitate a meal of impala antelope and roll in it.\n\nImage copyright \u00a9Nicholas Dyer Image caption Ahead of the game: An image highly commended in this year's Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition\n\nA second animal then ate the vomit, before bringing it back up and also rolling in it. A scent to camouflage a hunting expedition, perhaps.\n\n\"They have a reputation for being Africa's most effective hunters, with, they say, up to 80% of their hunts ending in a kill. Personally, I think that's a bit high, but it's definitely well above that of a lion or a cheetah or a leopard.\"\n\nImage copyright \u00a9Nicholas Dyer Image caption Evening games: Nick follows three groups in Mana Pools National Park\n\nOne reputation the wild dogs have long tried to shrug off is that of being \"vermin\".\n\nEuropean settlers in Africa systematically persecuted the animals, accusing them of taking down livestock.\n\nA hundred years ago, there were half a million painted wolves across the continent. Today, they number perhaps just over six thousand.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Nick Dyer: \"You would get a reward of 20 shillings if you brought some magistrate a tail\"\n\nIn the big parks, they're protected, but where they range close to humans they still suffer the consequences - caught in bushmeat snares or becoming roadkill.\n\nCatching diseases off domestic dogs also takes a toll.\n\nNick has recently been back in London to celebrate the annual Wildlife Photographer of the Year (WPY) competition run by the Natural History Museum.\n\nImage copyright \u00a9Nicholas Dyer Image caption Baboons fight back: The monkeys are now seen as prey by the dogs\n\nHis entry, Ahead Of The Game, was highly commended. And quite shocking.\n\nAt first glance, it's just a couple of pups bouncing along together.\n\nOn second glance, you realise the leading youngster has the face of a baboon in its mouth.\n\nThe monkeys are not the natural prey of wild dogs but a population boom in Mana Pools means the baboons are suddenly now on the opportunistic menu.\n\nImage copyright \u00a9Nicholas Dyer Image caption Glowing ears: The painted wolf once ranged right across Africa\n\nNick, who does a lot of his work through the Painted Wolf Foundation, wasn't directly involved in the new Attenborough series but photographed the dogs alongside the BBC team.\n\nHe's really hopeful the footage that's been captured will stir the public's interest in conservation.\n\n\"The BBC (programme) will probably be seen by a billion people and this myth of them being just savage hunters will be dispelled. I want them to see the beauty of this incredible animal and that it's really worth saving.\"\n\nImage copyright \u00a9Nicholas Dyer Image caption Curious pup: Nick is hoping for a conservation dividend from the new BBC TV series\n\nDynasties begins on Sunday 11 November on BBC One at 20:30 GMT. The painted wolves feature in the fifth programme in the series. Nick's WPY image is currently on display at the Natural History Museum.

    "text": "Image copyright stevanovicigor\n\nLauren Smith's partner tracked her phone and taught their son to call her offensive names.\n\nLast week, Paul Measor, 35, was found guilty of common assault against her.\n\nBut he was cleared of coercive control - after the judge described 24-year-old Lauren of being \"strong and capable\".\n\nCampaigners say the ruling highlights the lack of understanding around controlling behaviour in relationships - which might not leave physical scars but can still cause huge harm to victims.\n\nSo here are the key things you need to know.\n\nWhat is coercive control?\n\nCoercive control is a kind of domestic abuse, but it doesn't necessarily include physical abuse.\n\nIt results in a victim being isolated from their support network and reliant on someone who inflicts acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation.\n\nProfessor Evan Stark compares it to being taken hostage: \"The victim becomes captive in an unreal world created by the abuser, entrapped in a world of confusion, contradiction and fear.\"\n\nWhat are the signs?\n\nKatie Ghosh, chief executive of Women's Aid describes it like this: \"If your partner is constantly chipping away at your self-esteem and rubbishing you.\n\n\"If they are monitoring who you see, what you wear, where you go and taking away your ability to see your friends and family.\n\n\"Financial abuse, controlling and monitoring what you spend, can also be a warning sign.\"\n\nHere are some examples.\n\nBeing stopped from working or going to school/college/university\n\nHaving money taken away or controlled\n\nBeing isolated from friends and family\n\nHaving access to food, drinks and day-to-day products restricted\n\nHaving their social media accounts monitored or controlled\n\nBeing told what they should wear\n\nBeing threatened with violence if they do not behave in a certain way\n\nHaving threats made to loved ones or pets\n\nWho can become a victim?\n\nThere's a myth that coercive control - and domestic abuse in general - happens to older couples, who might have been together for years.\n\nBut that's not the case.\n\nAnyone can be a victim, says Katie: \"Domestic abuse knows no age limits. In fact, it's younger women who can be most at risk, particularly if they're in their first relationships.\"\n\nWhat does the law say?\n\nCoercive control only became a crime in 2015. It's defined as controlling behaviour that has a \"serious effect\" on a partner, causing them to fear violence at least twice or causing them serious distress.\n\nBut as with many domestic violence crimes, the number of people going to prison is far lower than the number of people accused.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here."

    "text": "Image copyright Liz Carlson\n\n\"It was the worst night of my entire life.\" That's how Liz Carlson describes finding 145 whales beached and dying on a remote New Zealand beach.\n\nThe travel blogger from the US was on a five-day hike on the Rakiura or Stewart Island with a friend when they came across the tragic scene.\n\nWhat would otherwise have a been a beautiful long stretch of deserted beach was the site of a desperate struggle for life.\n\nAlmost 150 pilot whales, beached in the low tide, were fighting in agony in the gentle surf.\n\nImage copyright Liz Carlson\n\n\"It was one of these jaw dropping moments,\" she told the BBC. \"We came to the beach around sunset and spotted something in the shallows.\n\n\"When we realised it was whales, we dropped everything and ran into the surf.\"\n\nShe'd seen whales in the wild before, she said, but \"nothing can prepare you for this, it was just horrific\".\n\n'The futility was the worst'\n\nThe two immediately tried to find some way to help, to push the whales back into deeper water.\n\n\"But you quickly realise that there is nothing you can do. They are just too big.\n\n\"The futility was the worst,\" she said. \"They are crying out to each other and are talking and clicking and there's no way to help them.\"\n\nImage copyright Julian Ripoll\n\nUnable to do anything themselves, they frantically thought of other ways to help.\n\nStewart Island is very remote, off the coast of New Zealand's South Island, and the beach they were hiking to is even more remote.\n\nThe pair hadn't seen any other hikers for the past two days but knew that about 15km (9 miles) away there was a hut where some conservation workers were based.\n\nWith no mobile phone reception, they hoped there might be a radio in the hut and Liz's friend, Julian Ripoll, set off running to get help.\n\n'My heart completely broke'\n\nThis left her all by herself, amid the scores of dying whales on the vast beach.\n\n\"I'll never forget their cries, the way they watched me as I sat with them in the water, how they desperately tried to swim but their weight only dug them deeper into the sands,\" she wrote on Instagram.\n\n\"My heart completely broke.\"\n\nImage copyright Liz Carlson\n\nThe 30-year-old spotted a young baby whale and tried to get it back into the water. While the adult whales were impossible to move at all, she did manage to move the young one.\n\n\"It took everything I had to get the baby into the water and then he just kept re-beaching himself,\" she told the BBC. \"After Julian left, I just sat there with the baby.\n\n\"You can sense the fear in the animals, they are looking at you. They watch you and they have very human-like eyes.\"\n\nImage copyright DOC\n\nOver the next few hours, there was little to do other than wait.\n\n\"I knew they would inevitably die,\" Liz wrote on Instagram. \"I sank to my knees in the sand screaming in frustration and crying, with the sound of dozens of dying whales behind me, utterly alone.\"\n\n'Tears in their eyes'\n\nA few hours later, Julian came back with a group of rangers. They were able to assess the situation but at night, it was clear that there was nothing that could be done.\n\nAt that time, most of the whales were still in the surf and the tide was still coming in. So Liz and Julian went to their campsite hoping that maybe overnight, the two whale pods would make it back to the ocean themselves.\n\nImage copyright Julian Ripoll\n\nThe next morning, they woke to a situation even more dire.\n\nIt was low tide and the whales were on the dry sand. Some had already died and the others were lying on the beach in pain, getting baked in the sun.\n\n\"They had tears in their eyes,\" Liz says. \"It looked like they are crying and they were making sad sounds.\"\n\nIt was clear that none of the whales could be saved.\n\nImage copyright Julian Ripoll\n\nIt takes around five people to move one of the whales and the beach - and the island itself - are so remote that there was no hope of bringing in help in time. Only a few hundred people live on the entire island.\n\nSo the rangers had to make what they called the \"heart-breaking\" decision to euthanise the remaining whales.\n\nThe only alternative would have been to leave them to a slow and painful death over several days.\n\nNew Zealand's Department of Conservation (DOC) said it would leave the bodies where they are and let nature take its course.\n\nThe DOC said it's not clear why whales beach themselves. Solo strandings \"are a relatively common occurrence on New Zealand shores\" but mass events are rare.\n\nIt could be the pod becomes confused by the shallow incline of a beach so goes in too close to shore, or that they are affected by illness\n\nPilot whales are also highly social, so the DOC says it could be simply that \"when one whale loses its way and strands, its pod mates may swim to its aid\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Almost 150 whales die in mass stranding\n\n."

However the atmosphere has not yet responded to the extra warmth that's produced by the upwelling seas.\n\nScientists have been predicting the likelihood of a new event since May this year, with confidence increasing.\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Meteorology are now estimating that an El Ni\u00f1o event will start in December. US forecasters are saying there's a 90% chance of the event starting in January.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Droughts in some places and floods in many others are linked to El Ni\u00f1o\n\nThe WMO models are say that a fully fledged El Ni\u00f1o is estimated to be 75-80% likely between December and February 2019.\n\nAt this point, the WMO says its predictions for the event range from just a warm-neutral condition through to a moderate strength event with sea surface temperatures peaking between 0.8C to 1.2C above average.\n\nThe chance of a strong event are currently low.\n\n\"The forecast El Ni\u00f1o is not expected to be as powerful as the event in 2015-2016, which was linked with droughts, flooding and coral bleaching in different parts of the world,\" said Maxx Dilley, director of WMO's Climate Prediction and Adaptation branch.\n\n\"Even so, it can still significantly affect rainfall and temperature patterns in many regions, with important consequences to agricultural and food security sectors, and for management of water resources and public health, and it may combine with long-term climate change to boost 2019 global temperatures,\" he said.\n\nIn terms of food security, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) have issued a report detailing the countries that could suffer food shortages as a result of the event."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Image copyright AFP\n\nThe inauguration of George HW Bush as president in January 1989 was the culmination of a career built on privilege: a series of political promotions ending at the White House.\n\nThe 41st president of the United States had previously served eight years as vice-president to Ronald Reagan and was the first serving vice-president for more than 150 years to be elected to the highest office.\n\nHis term in office was defined by his foreign policy at a time when communism was collapsing in Eastern Europe and the dissolution of the USSR left the US as the world's only superpower.\n\nHis policies helped restore the credibility of the US in the rest of the world and lay to rest the ghost of the intervention in Vietnam.\n\nBut he was accused of neglecting domestic affairs and, after reneging on a campaign promise not to increase taxes, he was defeated by Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential election.\n\nA political life\n\n\u20221966: Wins seat in House of Representatives\n\n\u20221971: Nixon installs him as UN ambassador\n\n\u20221974: Heads newly established mission in Beijing\n\n\u20221976: Ford makes him CIA director\n\n\u20221981-1989: Ronald Reagan's vice-president\n\n\u20221989-1993: President of the US; leads US into first Gulf War; copes with collapse of communism in Eastern Bloc\n\nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush was born on 12 June 1924 in Milton, Massachusetts, the son of an investment banker who later became a US senator.\n\nHe volunteered for the US Navy after Pearl Harbor. He trained as an aviator before being assigned duties in the Pacific where he saw action against the Japanese during World War Two.\n\nJust 18, he may well have been America's youngest flying officer, assigned to pilot torpedo bombers off aircraft carriers.\n\nHe was shot down in September 1944 while on a bombing raid. His plane filled with smoke and flames swallowed both wings. \"My God,\" he recalled thinking, \"This thing's going to blow up.\"\n\nHe continued to pilot the aircraft, dropping his bombs on their target. He ordered his two fellow crew members to parachute out of the plane but neither man survived.\n\nChoking on the smoke, Bush followed his crew - smashing his head on the tail of the plane as the wind propelled him backwards.\n\nImage copyright US Navy Image caption He was picked up by a US submarine after his plane was shot down in the Pacific. 'Welcome aboard, sir,' said the torpedo man who hauled him from the water. 'Happy to be aboard,' replied the future commander-in-chief.\n\nHe made it into a tiny life-raft and began paddling away from the nearby Japanese island with his hands. Incredibly, a US submarine rose to the surface right next to him and his rescue was even captured on camera.\n\nFollowing his honourable discharge from the navy in 1945, Bush married 18-year-old Barbara Pierce. Their marriage would last 72 years and they would have six children together.\n\nTheir first son, the future president George Walker Bush, was born a year later.\n\nBush had been offered a place at Yale prior to his enlistment in the navy, and he took it up in 1945, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nImage copyright George Bush Presidential Library Image caption Only weeks after returning from the Pacific, Bush married Barbara Pierce. 'I married the first man I ever kissed,' the future First Lady recalled. 'When I tell my children that they just about throw up.'\n\nBush and his family then moved to Texas where, with the use of his father's business connections, he got a job in the oil industry. By the age of 40, he was a millionaire.\n\nHe and Barbara suffered the trauma of losing their first daughter to leukaemia. Robin was taken to the doctor suffering from tiredness and the awful diagnosis was completely unexpected.\n\nImage copyright Corbis Image caption Two future presidents - George H W Bush holding aloft his baby son, George junior\n\nThe family was shattered by her death a few months later. When Barbara Bush herself died, 65 years later, the family posted a touching note. \"Give Robin a hug from us, Mom,\" it said.\n\nConservatism\n\nGeorge's professional interest had turned to politics. After serving as the chairman of a local branch of the Republican Party he took a major step, seeking and winning the Republican nomination for the US Senate seat for Texas.\n\nThe Democratic incumbent successfully branded Bush as a right-wing extremist, gaining 56% of the vote to Bush's 43%. Undaunted, Bush successfully stood for the House of Representatives in 1966, where he served for two terms.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon persuaded Bush to try for the Senate again in 1970 but, again, he was defeated by the Democratic candidate. Instead, Nixon appointed him US ambassador to the United Nations in 1971 and then Republican Party chairman.\n\nWhen Nixon was forced to resign 1974, Bush did his best to heal some of the wounds left by Watergate, touring the country in support of Republican candidates. At the end of the year he went to Beijing as head of the new US mission there.\n\nImage copyright Empics Image caption As Republican National Chairman in 1973 with then Vice-president Gerald Ford\n\nAfter just over a year in China, President Gerald Ford brought him home to take charge of the Central Intelligence Agency, which had been rocked by a series of scandals relating to covert operations abroad and unauthorised spying on US citizens.\n\nThe posting coincided with a deterioration in Barbara's mental health. She wrote in her biography that she would have to pull her car up on the side of the road for fear of steering into a tree, or on-coming traffic. The dark feelings eventually passed.\n\nBush left the CIA after Ford left office and, in 1978, began campaigning for the Republican nomination for the 1980 presidential election.\n\nHe travelled the country, preaching his brand of moderate conservatism and, by the beginning of 1980, had emerged as the main challenger to Ronald Reagan.\n\nBut he entered the presidential fray only to find that his privileged past could be a political liability.\n\n\"What's wrong with excellence?\" he said at the time. \"What's wrong with having a good education? What's wrong with having excelled in my life and business or being a good ambassador in China or the United Nations, or having done an excellent job at the CIA? I have. I know that sounds a little immodest, but that's my record.\"\n\nImage copyright Keystone/Getty images Image caption A cabinet meeting in the family quarters of the White House. From left to right: James Baker, Edwin Meese, Vice-President George Bush, Reagan and Caspar Weinberger, secretary of defence\n\nDefeated by Reagan there was, once again, a consolation: a ticket to the White House as Reagan's deputy and eight years of training for the top job itself.\n\nRead my lips\n\nIn the 1988 race which delivered George HW Bush to the presidency, he made two fundamental misjudgements.\n\nThe first was his choice of vice-presidential candidate: Dan Quayle, a little-known senator from Indiana, who gained international fame through a series of gaffes. The second was in a speech Bush made at the 1988 Republican National Convention.\n\nDuring an attack on the fiscal policy of his Democratic opponent, Michael Dukakis, Bush made a pledge that was to haunt his presidency and ultimately bring about his political downfall.\n\n\"Read my lips,\" he told the assembled delegates. \"No new taxes.\"\n\nAfter one of the most acrimonious election campaigns in US history, Bush became the first serving vice-president to be elected to the top job since Martin van Buren in 1836.\n\nIt was a time of momentous change which saw the the fall of the Iron Curtain and the collapse of the Soviet empire.\n\nImage caption George H W Bush came to the presidency at a time of great global change. 'A new breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn; for in man's heart, if not in fact, the day of the dictator is over,' he declared on the steps of the Capitol\n\n\"A new breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn; for in man's heart, if not in fact, the day of the dictator is over,\" he declared on the steps of the Capitol.\n\nDon't go wobbly, George\n\nHis true test came in August 1990 when the US was caught off-guard by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Bush moved quickly to build an international coalition to end Saddam Hussein's occupation and establish a US military toehold in Saudi Arabia, a valuable strategic dividend.\n\nImage copyright VT freeze frame Image caption When Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, George HW Bush faced his greatest foreign policy dilemma. When he decided to delay military action in order to get approval from the UN, Margaret Thatcher famously warned him that \"this is no time to go wobbly\".\n\nHe delayed military action in order to give time to secure UN approval for the action. The decision led to a famous rebuke from Margaret Thatcher.\n\n'Well, all right, George, but this is no time to go wobbly,\" said the Iron Lady in a middle-of-the-night phone call from Downing Street.\n\nThe subsequent battle proved to be a triumph for American military expertise and a major boost for the nation's morale.\n\nIn the defining moment of Bush's presidency, the US and its allies swept across the desert in a ground war lasting just 100 hours.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The 1991 Gulf war was one of the biggest tests of his presidency. The ground war lasted 100 hours but Saddam Hussein remained in power\n\nThe victory boosted the president's standing despite the fact that US and allied forces stopped well short of Baghdad, allowing Saddam Hussein to remain in power. It would be left to the president's son to topple the Iraqi dictator.\n\nDespite achieving popularity ratings of 90%, Bush's decision to concentrate on foreign affairs led to accusations that he was ignoring the worsening economic situation at home, most notably, the longest-lasting recession since World War Two.\n\nHamstrung by a Democratic-controlled Congress, President Bush insisted that the worst was over economically.\n\n\"We are going to lift this nation out of hard times,\" he pledged, \"Inch-by-inch and day-by-day and those who would stop us had better step aside.\"\n\nBut the country would not believe him. To make matters worse he did the one thing he had promised he would never do: he raised taxes.\n\nThe 1992 election was a disaster. He was let down by a poorly run campaign and had to fight off a strong challenge from the conservative Pat Buchanan for the Republican nomination.\n\nDefeat\n\nBush could not match the energy of his opponent, the young Democratic governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton, who conveyed a new vision for America that Bush admitted he simply could not express.\n\nThe image that summed it all up came on a trade trip to Japan that ended in dismal failure when the president fainted after vomiting at a banquet laid on by his hosts. Bush went down to a landslide defeat.\n\nHis later years were spent touring the world in his role as elder statesman. Though delighted to see George W Bush enter the White House, relations between the two men were said to be somewhat strained.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Relations between the two Bush presidents were said to have sometimes been strained\n\nBush celebrated his 90th birthday in June 2014 by making a tandem parachute jump near his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine. But he began to make fewer public appearances and was forced to use a wheelchair after developing a form of Parkinson's which meant he could no longer use his legs.\n\nA series of women accused him of acting inappropriately towards them at various times in the past. A spokesman, Jim McGrath, acknowledged that Mr Bush had \"on occasion\u2026 patted women's rears in what he intended to be in a good-natured manner\". The former president denied groping anyone but let it be known he apologised to anyone he might have offended.\n\nHe also lost Barbara - his wartime bride - after more than seven decades of marriage. Her funeral was attended by Bill Clinton and Barack Obama - although President Trump stayed away.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption George HW Bush at the funeral of his wife Barbara, surrounded by former presidents and first ladies\n\nAs president, he proved himself an efficient chief executive - more of a manager than inspiring leader. His public image suffered because of his Ivy League background and many voters saw him as lacking a common touch.\n\nHis foreign policy was successful in the handling of the invasion of Kuwait and the fall of communism. His domestic agenda will be less well applauded - with critics complaining he came across as a somewhat confused president with a shaky grasp of economics.\n\nAnd personally, George Herbert Walker Bush will be remembered as, essentially, a cultured family man, uncomfortable with the rough and tumble of politics.\n\n\"Because you run against each other that doesn't mean you're enemies,\" he once said. \"Politics doesn't have to be uncivil and nasty.\""

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Image copyright PA Image caption Former Made in Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh gave items to a pop-up \"slow fashion\" store in east London\n\nThe business model used by the fashion industry is broken and firms need help to adopt more sustainable practices, MPs have been told.\n\nThe warning, from a London College of Fashion academic, comes amid increased scrutiny of the UK's fashion retailers.\n\nProf Dilys Williams, director of the college's centre for sustainable fashion, said legislation and government support were needed.\n\nMarks & Spencer, Primark, Boohoo and Asos have all given evidence to MPs.\n\nEarlier this month, Prof Williams appeared before the Commons environmental audit committee's inquiry into the sustainability of the fashion industry.\n\nIn response to a question from Green MP Caroline Lucas about whether a T-shirt can be produced sustainably for \u00a35.99, Prof Williams said: \"If a business is built on fair wages and living within environmental limits then, no, we cannot sell T-shirts at the price that we currently are.\n\n\"We are buying 400% more pieces than we were less than 20 years ago... we are spending the money on stuff that we are chucking away.\n\n\"The system is broken and it cannot continue as it is. Most businesses know that, but it is about helping them to make that transition to a new form of business.\"\n\nThis era should be seen as a \"blip in fashion history\", Prof Williams said.\n\nPhoebe English, a south London-based designer, told the hearing that High Street retailers know \"their business models are just not sustainable\" because young people's shopping habits are changing.\n\n\"They will not be going into Primark and coming out with five bags of clothes where garments have cost them five or six quid to purchase and buying multiple clothes - the same clothes in different colours. It is just not how people will be shopping in the future and they know their time is coming up,\" she said.\n\nOne way of reducing the amount of disposable fashion could be renting clothes, Ms English suggests.\n\nImage copyright Phoebe English Image caption Phoebe English says renting could be one solution to fast fashion\n\nHer label has been experimenting with putting pieces that cost close to \u00a31,000 on a hiring website, which she says allows consumers to enjoy exciting designs without paying huge sums only to have clothes sit in a wardrobe after being worn once or twice.\n\n\"With hiring you get that endorphin high constantly because you can have a new thing within your purchasing power, which can help transform you as a person and make you feel better and make you look stronger and more positive, and you can do it more regularly,\" Ms English told MPs.\n\n\"It is a really exciting business plan that could absolutely be implicated within the High Street and it definitely should be.\"\n\nClaire Bergkamp, director of innovation and sustainability at Stella McCartney, says reselling and rental are ways of disrupting the fast fashion model: \"There is a generation now that has probably never seen anything outside of lower-quality product.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Prof Dilys Williams says the fast fashion model is broken\n\nThe members of the environmental audit committee have written to the UK's biggest fashion retailers asking how they can reduce the environmental harm.\n\n\"Three-in-five garments end in landfill or incinerators within a year ... half a million tonnes of microfibres a year enter the ocean. Doing nothing is not an option,\" chair Mary Creagh told the BBC in October.\n\nTheir questions to retailers include whether they pay the living wage and ensure child labour is not used in factories; whether they recycle materials and encourage recycling; how they are reducing the flow of microfibres into oceans; and whether they incinerate unsold or returned stock.\n\nEarlier this year it emerged that Burberry destroyed unsold clothes, accessories and perfume worth \u00a328.6m in 2017 to protect its brand and maintain its exclusivity.\n\nOrsola de Castro, co-founder of activist group Fashion Revolution, has called burning and sending stock to landfill as fashion's \"dirtiest open secret\".\n\nBurberry is unusual in disclosing the practice, however. Just six of the 35 high-end designers and High Street retailers contacted by the BBC earlier this year gave breakdowns or further information. The rest said they could not help or did not respond at all.\n\nThe fashion industry is taking steps to reduce the environmental impact of clothing, according to the British Retail Consortium. It says members are now designing products that are made to last and encouraging customers to return unwanted clothes for reuse."

We see them as part of the team,\" she said.\n\nThe tourist attraction, as well as the adjacent public park, were closed on Friday \"to facilitate containment of the river otter\".\n\nThe Vancouver Park Board has hired a wildlife relocation expert to catch the creature and transport it to the Fraser Valley in south-western British Columbia.\n\nParks director Howard Normann said the first trap set earlier this week failed when the hinge that would have captured the otter ended up blocked by a branch and the animal simply feasted on the bait.\n\n\"The otter did take our tuna, did take our trout, did take our chicken,\" he told the BBC.\n\nNow, a series of traps will be placed around the garden and park so they can catch the otter and allow it to be relocated to \"a really nice new home\".\n\nGarden staff say they are looking forward to life returning to normal for both the otter and their fish.\n\nThe classical Chinese garden is billed as the first of its kind built outside China.\n\nModelled after the Ming Dynasty scholars' gardens in Suzhou, a city west of Shanghai, it is located in Vancouver's Chinatown neighbourhood."

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The heat wave experienced across the UK in the summer of 2018 could become the norm\n\nIn its first major update on climate change in almost 10 years, the Met Office has warned of significant temperature rises in the decades ahead.\n\nThe UK Climate Projections 2018 study is the most up to date assessment of how the UK may change over this century.\n\nIt says that under the highest emissions scenario, summer temperatures could be 5.4C hotter by 2070.\n\nThe chances of a summer as warm as 2018 are around 50% by 2050.\n\nOne key figure in the report is the rise in summer temperatures - up to 5.4C warmer than the average between 1981-2000.\n\nThis would only happen, according to the Met Office, if the world was to continue increasing emissions of carbon dioxide rather than reducing them as most governments intend.\n\nSo for a central location in England like Nottingham, the Met Office says that, under a high emissions future (where greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere over coming decades are at the high end of all possible scenarios), temperatures could rise by between 1.1C to 5.8C.\n\nFor other central locations in the nations of the UK, there are similar ranges of projected temperature rises.\n\nIn Scotland, at Pitlochry, the summer rise ranges from 0.6C to 4.8C warmer. Around Aberystwyth in Wales, they range from 0.9C to 5.9C warmer while Cookstown in Northern Ireland could be 0.8 to 4.9C hotter.\n\nBut even under a low emissions scenario, the Met Office says that the UK will see an increase in the average yearly temperature of up to 2.3C by 2100.\n\nSummers as warm as the one just past, are likely to be very common, with a 50% chance of occurring.\n\n\"With really hot summers like this year's - in the 1990s that was a less than 5% chance of getting those,\" said Met Office chief scientist Dr Stephen Belcher.\n\n\"Now we are up to a 15-20% chance. By 2050 that's a normal summer\u2026By late century it depends what we do about greenhouse gases.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The UK faces wetter winters and drier summers\n\nThese warmer summers of the future are likely to be much drier too, with average summer rainfall dropping by 47% by 2070. Winters could be warmer by up to 4.2C but they will also see more rainfall, increasing by up to 35% by 2070, under the worst emissions scenario.\n\nRaised sea levels are also one of the consequences of a warmer world and according to the report, they could increase by 1.15 metres in London by 2100.\n\nThe report says the UK is set to see an increase in both the frequency and magnitude of extreme water levels.\n\nJust a few weeks ago the UK's Committee on Climate Change (CCC) warned that by 2080 up to 1.2 million homes may be at increased risk of flooding.\n\n\"The UK18 projections are further evidence that we will see more extreme weather in the future - we need to prepare and adapt now, climate change impacts are already being felt with the record books being re-written,\" said Emma Howard Boyd, chair of the Environment Agency.\n\n\"The Environment Agency cannot wall up the country, but will be at the forefront - protecting communities, building resilience, and responding to incidents.\"\n\nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove praised the new study as an \"invaluable tool\" as it will help with decisions on large infrastructure.\n\n\"It is clear that the planet and its weather patterns are changing before our eyes,\" he said, launching the report at the Science Museum in London.\n\n\"We know, more than ever before, the urgency of acting.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why there were so many heatwaves around the world in 2018\n\nMr Gove has been stressing that Britain has a good track record on climate change, having cut emissions by 40% since 1990 while continuing to grow the economy. However, other political figures say that the new report underlines how much more needs to be done.\n\n\"These projections paint a devastating picture of what climate breakdown means for the UK if we continue down the path we're on,\" said Green party MP Caroline Lucas.\n\n\"Michael Gove's vague talk of mitigating the worst impacts of floods, droughts and storms are far from reassuring.\"\n\nSome researchers were also critical of the report, saying that it gave the impression that scientists can give more detail about the future than is possible.\n\n\"It (the report) feeds our desire for specifics and for high resolution pictures,\" said Prof David Stainforth from the Grantham Research Institute on climate change and the environment.\n\n\"It is valuable in bringing to life the types of changes we want to avoid. It is, however, based on research at the edge of scientific understanding, using methods whose reliability has been questioned. It is not reliable and robust in the way that knowledge of the climate change threat is, so it creates its own risks.\"\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter."

    "text": "An average of 137 women across the world are killed by a partner or family member every day, according to new data released by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).\n\nThey say it makes \"the home the most likely place for a woman to be killed\".\n\nMore than half of the 87,000 women killed in 2017 were reported as dying at the hands of those closest to them.\n\nOf that figure, approximately 30,000 women were killed by an intimate partner and another 20,000 by a relative.\n\nBBC 100 Women wanted to find out more about the women behind the numbers. We spent October monitoring reports of gender-related killings of women on the first day of that month. We will share some of their stories below and find out more about how these killings were reported.\n\nMale homicide rates still higher\n\nThe data collected by UNODC highlights that \"men are around four times more likely than women to lose their lives as a result of intentional homicide\".\n\nThe UN indicates that men accounted for eight out of 10 homicide victims worldwide.\n\nHowever, the same report suggests that more than eight out of 10 victims of homicides committed by intimate partners are female.\n\n\"Intimate partner violence continues to take a disproportionately heavy toll on women,\" the report states.\n\nForty-seven women, 21 countries, one day\n\nThe UN statistics summarise the findings for 2017 based on homicide statistics provided by government sources. The figures for \"gender-related killings of women and girls\", or \"femicide\", are collated using the criteria of intimate partner/family-related homicide.\n\nBBC 100 Women and BBC Monitoring set out to find out more about the women behind the numbers.\n\nWe monitored press coverage of women killed by another person on 1 October 2018 around the world.

This appears to be the case with another long-term couple who were found dead in Brazil on the same day that Zeinab was executed.\n\nImage copyright Reproduction / Facebook\n\nSandra Lucia Hammer Moura, 39, Brazil\n\nSandra Lucia Hammer Moura married Augusto Aguiar Ribeiro at the age of 16.\n\nThe couple had been separated for five months when she was killed by him.\n\nPolice in Jardim Taquari confirmed to BBC Brasil that she was stabbed in the neck.\n\nThey found a video of her husband confessing to the crime on his mobile phone. In it, he said that Sandra was already dating another man and he felt betrayed.\n\nHe also said in the video that he would not be arrested as the couple would go to the \"glory of the Lord\" together. He then hanged himself in what had been their bedroom.\n\nSandra's case highlights a form of killing known as a \"murder-suicide\" - when an individual kills one or more people before killing themselves.\n\nBBC Monitoring found 14 cases of women killed on 1 October this year in Latin America.

    "authors": [
      "Matt Mcgrath",

    ],
    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nThe European Union says it is aiming to become the first major economy to go \"climate neutral\" by 2050.\n\nUnder the plan, emissions of greenhouse gases after that date would have to be offset by planting trees or by burying the gases underground.\n\nScientists say that net-zero emissions by 2050 are needed to have a fighting chance of keeping global temperatures under 1.5C this century.\n\nThe EU says the move will also cut premature air pollution deaths by 40%.\n\nWhat is climate neutrality?\n\nClimate neutrality means your emissions are balanced by methods of removing warming gases from the atmosphere. So the warming emissions that are created by cars and power plants should be counteracted by the greenhouse gases removed from the air by the planting of new forests or through carbon capture technologies which would see the CO2 buried underground.\n\nGetting to this point would require large cuts in emissions from the current position. Since 1990 the EU has cut its emissions by over 20% while the economies of member states have continued to grow.\n\nThey have set themselves much harder targets for 2030 of cutting emissions by 40% - The EU says it will achieve this target but now plans to go much further again by becoming climate neutral by 2050.\n\nHow will they get there?\n\nThe EU have set out eight scenarios for member states to cut warming gases - two of these strategies would see Europe become climate neutral.\n\nThe EU says that this can be done with existing technologies such as solar and wind energy which would have to be ramped up to provide 80% of electricity. Energy efficiency measures such as home insulation would also need to be boosted to reduce energy consumption by half by the middle of the century.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\n\"With this plan, Europe will be the world's first major economy to go for net-zero emissions by 2050,\" said EU climate commissioner Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete. \"We have all the tools to be ambitious.\"\n\nThe EU believes that the measures will help achieve the goals of the Paris agreement will be expensive but will boost economies by 2% of GDP by 2050 and reduce energy imports by over 70%, saving up to three trillion euros a year.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nThe IPCC report on keeping temperatures below 1.5C was a \"wake-up call\" said Mr Ca\u00f1ete. Reports in recent days have also underlined just how far the gap has grown between what countries promised to do under the Paris agreement, and how far they've gotten with those endeavours.\n\nThe UN emissions gap study also showed that the majority of rich countries are not on track to meet their carbon cutting commitments by 2030.\n\nWith global climate talks due to start in a few days in Poland the EU's move, although still a strategy and not a firm commitment, will be welcome news.\n\n\"If we do not lead, no one else will,\" said Mr Ca\u00f1ete.\n\nIs everyone in Europe happy with the new strategy?\n\nNot quite. Some countries such as Germany are struggling with their current commitments and are worried that further cuts would threaten their industries. Others such as Poland are still reliant on coal and would object to even more stringent restrictions on the use of fossil fuels.\n\nSome countries though are keen to press ahead - a group of ten, including Denmark, Sweden and Spain have written a letter to the EU asking for a \"clear direction\" towards net-zero emissions.\n\nClimate campaigners say the step, though welcome, doesn't go far enough fast enough.\n\nThey are worried that there is no plan to increase the intermediate targets for 2030, which many scientists say is crucial. They also want the net-zero date brought forward.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption EU climate commissioner Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete\n\n\"We are calling for 2040 as the time that would be most in line with safer scenarios to keep temperatures under 1.5C,\" said Wendel Trio from Climate Action Network Europe.\n\n\"Going to net-zero by 2050 as the Commission proposes might need a lot of reliance on carbon removal techniques, there are lots of proposals but it is not clear that it can actually happen.\"\n\nHas anyone else signed up to climate neutrality?\n\nSweden has legislated to achieve net zero emissions by 2045. Other countries are looking at it, including the UK which has asked the Committee on Climate Change to report on the idea.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe EU says there needs to be a debate among member states about how to achieve this long term goal. The plan is to adopt and submit the ambitious strategy to the UN by early 2020.\n\nHowever any further development could be held up by the fact that a new EU commission will be selected next year."

When owner Geoff Pearson tried to put him up for auction last month, meat processors said they simply couldn't handle him - so Knickers avoided the abattoir.\n\nHe will now live out the rest of his life on Lake Preston feedlot in Myalup, 136km (85 miles) south of Perth.\n\n\"Knickers lives on,\" says Mr Pearson, who has been fielding calls from local journalists since the Australian public broadcaster drew attention to the enormous steer - a Holstein Friesian, but significantly taller than the average for that breed.\n\nHe was first bought as a \"coach\" - a steer that leads other cattle - at the age of about 12 months. Steers are castrated males.\n\n\"He was always a standout steer from the others, a bit bigger than the rest,\" says Mr Pearson. Although \"some of his mates\" were sent for slaughter at an early age, \"he was still a standout so we thought let's leave him there, he's not hurting anyone\".\n\nBut after a few more rotations of cattle, the cattle farmers \"realised he wasn't stopping growing\". And now he's too big to sell.\n\nMr Pearson - who owns about 20,000 cattle - reckons Knickers has a few years left. He's a hit with the other cattle, who follow him around the paddocks in their hundreds. Many of the cattle are wagyu and are dark brown. Black and white Knickers stands out even more in a pack because of his colour.\n\nAnd where did the name come from?\n\n\"When he was young, when we first got him, we had a Brahman steer [a breed of cattle] which was a friend of his,\" explains Mr Pearson. \"So his name was bra... so we [had] bra and knickers.\n\n\"We never thought he would turn into a big knickers.\"\n\nAccording to the record books, the tallest living steer is Bellino - who was 2.027m tall when he was measured in 2010 in Italy."

It represents the person's high social status,\" says coffin maker Steve Ansah.\n\nYou may also like:\n\nMost people call the pieces of art fantasy coffins, but they are locally called Abeduu Adekai, which means \"proverb boxes\".\n\nThis is because there is a symbolic meaning behind each design.\n\nImage copyright Fellipe Abreu\n\nAeroplanes are also among the popular designs. This one is for a child. It symbolizes his successful journey to the afterlife.\n\nSometimes community members chip in to help with the costs of making a coffin.\n\nImage copyright Fellipe Abreu\n\nIn recent years, the real estate sector has boomed in Ghana. This coffin is for a landlord who was widely appreciated by his community for building and renting homes to them.\n\n\"Generally, it's the responsibility of loved ones and family members to buy the coffin for the deceased. But they also have to pay for the ceremony, including buying food and drink, and clothing for the deceased.\"\n\n\"The ceremony happens from Thursday to Monday. On Thursday the family gets the coffin; on Friday the body is brought from the mortuary; on Saturday the funeral takes places, while on Sunday people go to church. On Monday family members count the money that was invested and donated,\" Mr Adjetey says.\n\nImage copyright Fellipe Abreu\n\nCarpenters carve the coffin, then sand it to create a uniform surface ready to be painted. A local singer will be buried in this microphone-shaped coffin.\n\n\"We don't know the person's size so we ask the family, or even rely on photos,\" says Mr Ansah, the carpenter.\n\nImage copyright Fellipe Abreu\n\nIn recent years, other carpenters have started making custom-made coffins to meet the booming local demand.\n\nImage copyright Fellipe Abreu\n\nThe palanquin and queen is actually not a coffin, it was custom-made for an art gallery in Philadelphia in the US.\n\nCustomers in more than 20 countries have bought these coffins over the last decades.\n\nThe coffin designs have also attracted interest from woodworking students in South Korea, Russia, US and Denmark, who have come to Ghana to learn the trade.\n\nLocal carpenters often use simple handmade tools to sand the wood and carve the wood into a coffin shape.\n\nImage copyright Fellipe Abreu\n\nText and photos by Fellipe Abreu and Henrique Hedler"

    "text": "Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption The government blamed illegal logging for the rise\n\nDeforestation of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil has hit its highest rate in a decade, according to official data.\n\nAbout 7,900 sq km (3,050 sq miles) of the world's largest rainforest was destroyed between August 2017 and July 2018 - an area roughly five times the size of London.\n\nEnvironment Minister Edson Duarte said illegal logging was to blame.\n\nThe figures come amid concerns about the policies of Brazil's newly elected president, Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nDuring the 2018 election campaign, Mr Bolsonaro pledged to limit fines for damaging forestry and to weaken the influence of the environmental agency.\n\nAn aide for the president-elect has also announced the administration will merge the agriculture and environment ministries, which critics say could endanger the rainforest.\n\nThe latest government data says most of the deforestation occurred in the states of Mato Grosso and Par\u00e1, and marked a 13.7% rise over last year's figures.\n\nMato Grosso is the top producer of grains in Brazil, and critics say expanding agriculture is also encroaching on the rainforest.\n\nMr Duarte blamed \"an upsurge in organised crime\" for the illegal deforestation, and said the country must broaden the fight against \"environmental violations and in defence of sustainable development of the biome\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Amazon is sometimes called the lungs of the planet\n\nSatellite data from the deforestation monitoring project known as Prodes informed the annual survey.\n\nWhile the rate does mark a significant rise from last year, when the rate of deforestation dropped 16% in a 12-month period, it still marks a 72% drop from 2004, when the Brazilian federal government launched measures to combat deforestation.\n\nIn that year, an area the size of Haiti - more than 27,000 sq km - was cleared from the rainforest.\n\nThe Amazon region holds the largest tropical rainforest in the world and is home to plant and animal species that are still being discovered by scientists.\n\nMost of its millions of square kilometres are inside Brazil, where under laws dating back to 1965, landowners must keep a percentage of their property forested."

Some 2.5 million more workers are expected to arrive over the next three years - placing the fast-growing city under housing strain.\n\nMr Forlales' modular CUBO homes will be used to house the newcomers, before being extended to the slums at large.\n\nImage caption Mr Forlales will start work on the first of his modular homes in 2019\n\nImage caption The project is designed to help the influx of workers moving to Manila's slums\n\nThe young designer was inspired by his grandparent's rural bamboo house - though his bamboo will be treated and laminated for a 10-times-longer lifecycle.\n\nThe material is an eco-friendly choice, as it releases 35% more oxygen than trees and can be harvested annually without causing soil degradation.\n\nThe CUBO homes also have slanted roofs to catch rainwater, and stilts to keep out floodwater.\n\nMr Forlales has picked out a plot of land in Manila for the project's first homes, and hopes his design can help other crowded cities too. In theory, it's viable anywhere that bamboo grows - which includes South-East Asia, and parts of Africa and Latin America.\n\nHe plans to raise funds for the project by selling waste plastic to factories.\n\nImage caption Bamboo is readily available in the Philippines, and can be grown on poor-quality land\n\nImage caption At \u00a350-60 per sq metre, the housing is considered highly affordable\n\n\"CUBO started as nothing more than an idea, conceived while spending time at my grandparent's house - it is incredible to think that it now will become a reality,\" Mr Forlales said.\n\n\"I would like to thank RICS for the opportunity to develop the idea, and look forward to working with them to put this money to good use in Manila, and then hopefully elsewhere around the world.\""

A student city like Brighton throws away tens of thousands of duvets a year.\n\nThey are buried in landfill or burned - but researchers are trying to insulate walls with them instead.\n\nIt's the sort of idea being promoted at a waste summit in London on Thursday to be addressed by the Prince of Wales and Environment Secretary Michael Gove.\n\nThe summit brings together 200 leaders from business, government, universities and voluntary groups in a bid to squeeze more useful life out of the materials we use.\n\nMaking goods (like polyester duvets) uses energy and releases greenhouses gases \u2013 and the Prince and the politician both say we can\u2019t tackle climate change unless we use materials more intelligently.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Cat Fletcher combs abandoned office buildings for unwanted treasures.\n\nThe target for firms at the summit is to reduce avoidable waste by 2030 and double the nation\u2019s resource productivity \u2013 that means getting more service from existing materials, and finding new uses for old materials.\n\nWhere denim legs keep a house warm\n\nThe Waste House in Brighton \u2013 where the duvet experiment is happening - offers a lesson in re-use of resources that would otherwise have been scrapped.\n\nThe house looks normal but its structure is built from construction waste, which forms the majority of the waste stream in the UK.\n\nIn its hollow walls they are testing the insulation qualities of an unlikely host of scrap - including old floppy discs; audio cassette cases; unfashionable rolls of wallpaper and \u2013 bizarrely - 1.8 tonnes denim legs cut off from trousers to make shorts.\n\nThe black tiles on the exterior walls look traditional, but are in fact carpet tiles with the waterproof rubber back facing outwards.\n\n'I just hate waste'\n\nCat Fletcher, who calls herself the \"Resource Goddess\" and runs re-use programmes in Brighton, told BBC News: \u201cI just hate waste. I hate it passionately. We simply can\u2019t afford to keep throwing things away like we do on our planet with finite resources.\u201d\n\nMore than 40 leading businesses have signed a commitment to the so-called Waste to Wealth summit. It\u2019s organised by the Prince\u2019s Business in the Community (BITC), which encourages responsible business.\n\nThey are committing to devising creative solutions for re-using waste materials, and to designing products that use less material in the first place.\n\nThe initiative will support the government\u2019s forthcoming Waste and Resources Strategy, which is due before Christmas.\n\nMinisters are under pressure from waste campaigners to produce policies that minimise waste. They want the Treasury, for instance, to scrap VAT on refurbishment on homes.\n\n'Insane' tax break to demolish buildings\n\nImage caption The Waste House incorporates wall tiles made from crushed waste oyster shells\n\nDuncan Baker-Brown, the architect of the Waste House, told BBC News: \"You pay 20% VAT to refurbish a building, but zero VAT to demolish and rebuild. There is a tax incentive to knock buildings down, which is frankly insane.\"\n\nA survey of over 2,000 UK adults published today by BITC and Ipsos MORI shows consumers want to do their bit to reduce waste.\n\nThe most popular actions from business to help consumers were:\n\nMoney-back incentives to encourage return of used packaging\n\nDedicated spaces in shops to return used packaging and clothing\n\nLoyalty points\n\nHiring things rather than buying them\n\nWaste Facts\n\nIn 2014 the UK generated 202.8 million tonnes of total waste. 59.4% came from construction, demolition and excavation, with households responsible for a further 13.7%. \u2013 DEFRA.\n\nAmanda Mackenzie, chief executive of Business in the Community, said: \u201cThe old adage \u2018waste not want not\u2019 has never been more relevant.\n\n\u201cThe research shows that customers welcome action from business which encourages them to do the right thing. Let\u2019s tackle this critical problem together and lead the world in doing so.\u201d\n\nSome other nations are, in fact, well ahead of the UK in re-using items. Finland is one of many countries with sophisticated superstores for up-cycled and second-hand goods.\n\nIn the UK, Devon County Council has taken a lead on the issue, and the website Freegle offers people the opportunity to give unwanted items away.\n\nSignatories to the BITC initiative so far include Co-Operative Bank, Deloitte, Greggs, Heineken, Iceland, Lloyds Banking Group, Marks & Spencer, PwC, Sky, Thames Water, Toyota, Costain, Arup, Marshalls, Unilever and Veolia.\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter."

    "authors": [
      "Rachel Nuwer"
    ],
    "text": "One hundred years ago nearly to the day, flu season seemed to be wrapping up without further incident. Most of those who had fallen ill in the spring had made a speedy recovery, and death rates were no higher than usual. Global headlines were dominated by news about the Great War, not the flu.\n\nCome autumn, however, everything changed. The formerly unexceptional virus reappeared as an exceedingly virulent strain, tearing through populations in North America and Europe and often killing its victims in a matter of hours or days. Within four months, the Spanish Flu, as it came to be known, had spread around the world, making its way to even the most isolated communities. By the time the pandemic flamed out the following spring, an estimated 50 to 100 million people \u2013 as much as 5% of the world\u2019s population \u2013 were dead.\n\nA century later, the 1918 pandemic seems as remote a horror story as that of smallpox, the bubonic plague and other deadly diseases that we have wholly or largely eradicated. Yet influenza never left \u2013 it continues to claim some 250,000 to 500,000 lives annually. Each year delivers a slightly different strain of the seasonal flu, while pandemics may arise by an assortment of influenza viruses in animal hosts. In addition to 1918, the last century has seen pandemics in 1957, 1968, 1977 and 2009.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nGiven the virus\u2019 propensity for mutation and its constant presence in nature (it occurs naturally in wild water birds), experts agree that it is only a matter of time until a strain emerges that is just as contagious and deadly as the Spanish flu \u2013 and possibly even worse.\n\n\u201cInfluenza pandemics are like earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunamis: they occur, and some are much worse than others,\u201d says Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThe idea that we would not have another 1918-like event is foolish.\u201d\n\nBut when that will happen, he continues, is impossible to predict: \u201cFor all we know, it could be starting as we speak.\u201d It\u2019s also impossible to predict exactly how things will play out when a Spanish flu-like strain does reemerge \u2013 but we can make some educated guesses.\n\nFor starters, the virus\u2019 impact would depend on whether we caught it early enough to contain it, says Robert Webster, from the Department of Infectious Diseases at St Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital. There are systems in place to do just that: the World Health Organization\u2019s influenza surveillance team constantly monitors the virus\u2019 development at six key labs around the world, and a complimentary set of agriculture-oriented labs do the same for poultry and pig samples.\n\n\u201cOur surveillance is probably as good as we can make it, but we can\u2019t survey every bird and pig in the world \u2013 it\u2019s just impossible,\u201d Webster says. \u201cWe would have to get damned lucky to contain it.\u201d\n\nAs history attests, deaths probably would not be evenly distributed across populations\n\nThe reality, he continues, is that the virus would almost certainly get out. Once that happened, it would make its way around the globe, likely in a matter of weeks, given the level of mobility today. \u201cThe flu is one of those viruses that, once it gets into a susceptible population, it really takes off,\u201d says Gerardo Chowell, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Georgia State University. \u201cIndividuals are already spreading it about one day before they have any symptoms.\u201d\n\nBecause the number of humans on the planet has jumped more than fourfold over the last century, there would likely be correspondingly higher numbers of infections and deaths compared to 1918. If the flu killed 50 million in 1918, we could expect to see more than 250 million casualties today, says Osterholm. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of body bags \u2013 which we\u2019d run out of very quickly.\u201d\n\nAs history attests, deaths probably would not be evenly distributed across populations. The Spanish flu saw a 30-fold mortality difference in various countries. In India, for example, the virus took out 8% of the population, while less than 1% died in Denmark. Similarly, during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, deaths in Mexico exceeded those in France by a factor of 10.\n\nExperts believe the disparities were influenced by a number of factors, including a population\u2019s prior exposure to similar influenza strains and genetic vulnerabilities of certain ethnic groups (New Zealand\u2019s native Maori, for example, were seven times more likely to die after contracting the 1918 flu than the global average).\n\nPoverty-related factors such as sanitation, baseline health and access to care, Chowell says, also play an important role in influencing an influenza virus\u2019 outcome. \u201cIn 2009 in Mexico, a lot of people came to the hospital only after they became very, very sick, and it was just too late,\u201d he says. For many of those victims this was an economic decision: going to the doctor meant taking a day off work, and thus a day off earning a salary. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that applied to every single Mexican, but it did apply exactly to the most vulnerable populations,\u201d Chowell says.\n\nInfluenza vaccines \u2013 which didn\u2019t even become available until the 1940s \u2013 are faster than ever to make, but that process still takes months\n\nShould a pandemic hit the US or other places without socialised healthcare, the same socioeconomic patterns would almost certainly play out in relation to the uninsured. To try to avoid steep medical bills, those without health insurance would likely wait as late as possible to visit the hospital \u2013 at which point it may be too late. \u201cWe already see that in terms of other infectious diseases and access to care,\u201d Chowell says.\n\nVaccines are the best means for stopping a pandemic, says Lone Simonsen, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Roskilde University in Denmark and George Washington University. But this requires first identifying the virus, creating a vaccine and then distributing it around the world \u2013 a task that\u2019s easier said than done. Influenza vaccines \u2013 which didn\u2019t even become available until the 1940s \u2013 are faster than ever to make, but that process still takes months. And even if we were successful at developing such a vaccine, it would simply be impossible to create enough doses for everyone, Osterholm says. \u201cWorldwide, in the first six to nine months, only 1-2% of the population would have access to a vaccine,\u201d he says. Another limitation, he adds, is that current seasonal flu vaccines are, at very best, just 60% effective.\n\nLikewise, while we have drugs like Tamiflu to combat influenza, we do not stockpile supplies for tackling a pandemic. \u201cWe don\u2019t have today enough antivirals even for the richest country in the world, the US,\u201d Chowell points out. \u201cSo what can we expect for India, China or Mexico?\u201d\n\nOn top of that, the drugs we do have are also less effective than comparative treatments for other diseases, primarily because \u201cthe world treats seasonal influenza as a rather trivial disease\u201d, Webster says. \u201cIt\u2019s not until you have serious outbreaks, like with HIV, that the scientific community gives a disease greater attention.\u201d\n\nGiven these realities, hospitals would quickly be overrun, Osterholm says, and drugs and vaccines would almost immediately run out. \u201cWe already overwhelmed the healthcare system here in the US with just the seasonal flu this year, and this wasn\u2019t even a particularly severe year,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it shows you just how limited our capacity is to respond to a major increase in cases.\u201d\n\nIf a pandemic causes disruption in the production and transportation of these drugs, we\u2019ll see people dying in short order - Michael Osterholm\n\nJust as happened in 1918, as infections and mortalities increased, cities around the world would most likely collapse. Businesses and schools would shutter; public transportation would not run; electricity may switch off; and bodies would begin to pile up in the streets. Food would soon be in short supply, as would life-saving drugs that currently keep millions with diabetes, cardiac disease, immunosuppressive conditions and other life-threatening issues alive.\n\n\u201cIf a pandemic causes disruption in the production and transportation of these drugs, we\u2019ll see people dying in short order,\u201d Osterholm says. \u201cCollateral damage from a 1918-like pandemic could be dramatic.\u201d\n\nEven after the virus fizzled out on its own, the impacts would be long-lasting. The 1918 virus was \u201cextra horrible\u201d, Simonsen says, in that 95% of those it killed were not the very young and very old, as per usual for influenza, but otherwise healthy adults at the peak of their working lives. This effectively removed a significant portion of the workforce and had profound effects on families, leaving countless children orphaned.\n\nScientists only learned why this likely was in 2005, when researchers reconstructed the Spanish flu virus using samples recovered from Brevig Mission, an Alaskan village in which 72 of 80 total residents were killed by the disease in less than a week. One victim\u2019s body had been preserved in permafrost well enough to allow a determined microbiologist to recover her lungs, which still contained the virus\u2019 genes.\n\nIn animal tests using the reconstructed viruses, scientists discovered that the 1918 strain multiplied exceptionally well. This triggered a natural immune response called a cytokine storm, in which the body goes into overdrive chugging out chemicals meant to stem the invasion. Cytokines are somewhat toxic themselves \u2013 they are responsible for the aches and pains experienced during a bout of the flu \u2013 and too many of them can overwhelm the organs and cause overall system failure.\n\nBecause adults have stronger immune systems than children and the elderly, researchers believe that their stronger responses to the flu may have proved deadly. \u201cWe finally understood why the virus was so enormously pathogenic,\u201d Webster says. \u201cThe body essentially killed itself.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t do much better with cytokine storms today than we did back in 1918 \u2013 Michael Osterholm\n\nIn the decades since the Spanish flu, researchers have developed various immunomodulatory therapies that can help mitigate cytokine storms. But those treatments are hardly perfect, and nor are they widely available. \u201cWe don\u2019t do much better with cytokine storms today than we did back in 1918,\u201d Osterholm says. \u201cThere are some machines that can breathe and circulate blood for you, but overall the outcome is still very, very bleak.\u201d\n\nThis means that, as in 1918, we would likely see a huge loss of life among young adults and the middle-aged.

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nNearly one in four young women has a mental illness, with emotional problems such as depression and anxiety the most common, figures for England show.\n\nThe official NHS report found young women aged 17 to 19 were twice as likely as young men to have problems, with 23.9% reporting a disorder.\n\nProblems are less common in younger age groups, but are rising, albeit slowly.\n\nIn children aged five to 15, one in nine had a disorder, up from one in 10 when the review was done 13 years ago.\n\nThe findings are based on a survey of more than 9,000 young people.\n\nThe results have been gathered by statistics body NHS Digital and assessed by experts to try to ensure only diagnosable conditions are included.\n\nDr Bernadka Dubicka, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the numbers of young women with problems was \"alarming\".\n\nShe said body image pressures, exam stress and the negative effects of social media may all affect girls disproportionately, while they were also more likely to be victims of abuse and sexual assault.\n\n\"We can only speculate. We still do not fully understand this - all we know is that we see more girls in our clinics.\n\n\"We have to make sure services are available for them.\"\n\nIt comes as the Children's Commissioner for England warned there was a \"vast gap\" in NHS mental health support.\n\nAnne Longfield's report criticised slow progress made in improving specialist community services for children.\n\nShe said waiting times were too long and she was concerned about numbers being rejected by services in some areas.\n\nNearly half of those in their late teens with mental health problems had self-harmed or attempted suicide. For younger teens it was about a quarter.\n\n'I've missed so much of my life'\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Poor mental health \"has taken so much of my life from me\"\n\nEmma Blezard, 18, says her mental health problems have robbed her of her teenage years.\n\nShe started experiencing difficulties when she was 13, suffering from anxiety and panic attacks before developing an eating disorder.\n\nIt was a year before she let on to her parents. She ended up having suicidal thoughts and was sectioned in hospital at one point.\n\n\"I've missed so much of my life because of this illness - I've lost friends, I've missed birthday, holidays.\n\n\"I wish I could do things over.\"\n\nEven when she was receiving treatment, she felt she did not deserve it.\n\n\"I became really isolated. At school I spent a lot of time out of lessons with the nurse. It was very difficult.\"\n\nShe has travelled all over the country for treatment and says she still struggles, although her problems are more manageable now.\n\n\"I don't think they will ever go away.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How should we talk about mental health?\n\nIs social media to blame for problems young people face?\n\nIt may be a factor, although it is hard to tell.\n\nThe NHS Digital review found children aged 11 to 19 with a mental health problem were more likely to use social media.\n\nNearly a third of them spent over four hours a day on social media.\n\nThose who did not have a mental health problem were two to three times less likely to spend that amount of time on it.\n\nThe young people with mental health problems were more likely to say their mood was affected by the number of \"likes\" they got and they were also more likely to compare themselves to others on social media.\n\nThe report cited cyber-bullying as an issue too.\n\nBut while this does suggest social media can have a negative impact, it does not prove it is to blame.\n\nPeople with mental health problems may be just more likely to find themselves on it, rather than it causing their problems in the first place. Indeed, they could even be using social media for support.\n\nAdolescence is key\n\nThe majority of problems reported, particularly in the older age groups, are linked to emotional disorders.\n\nThese are on the rise, whereas the other disorders they looked at - behavioural and hyperactivity - have remained relatively stable over time.\n\nUniversity College London psychiatrist Dr Michael Bloomfield said: \"Adolescence is a critical period for a person's development, particularly as our brains go through important changes during our teenage years.\n\n\"Since prevention is better than cure, it is really important for all of us in society to understand together why this is and start reducing the rates of mental disorders in young people.\"\n\nHow many children get help?\n\nThe NHS is only treating a fraction of the young people who have problems.\n\nThe Children's Commissioner's analysis of NHS figures from 2017-18 show that 325,000 children were treated by community services, while there are another 5,000 in hospital.\n\nThat is fewer than 3% of the population.\n\nThe figures showed that more than a third of young people referred to community services were turned away.\n\nThis could be because their needs were not severe enough to need help and could be dealt with through other services, such as in school or by charities and council social care teams.\n\nBut Ms Longfield said she was concerned children were getting turned away because services simply did not have time to see them.\n\nHer report also raised concerns about waiting times. Just under half of people who received treatment after a referral in 2017-18 had waited longer than six weeks. The average waiting time was nearly two months.\n\nWhat needs to happen?\n\nThe commissioner believes children's services are under-funded. Around \u00a3700m is spent on child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) and eating disorders support.\n\nBy comparison, services for adults receive 15 times more despite children representing 20% of the population.\n\nThe commissioner said an extra \u00a31.7bn would need to be invested to bring children's services in line.\n\nShe said this could help pay for more early help by funding NHS counsellors in schools for example.\n\nEmma Thomas, chief executive of the Young Minds charity, said there was a lack of support for children.\n\nShe said the charity gets \"calls every day\" about children who are waiting for help or have been denied help.\n\n\"This can have devastating consequences - in some cases, children start to self-harm, become suicidal or drop out of school while waiting for the help they need.\"\n\nShe agreed early intervention and better funding were essential.\n\nWhat is the government doing?\n\nBoth NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care have made improving children's mental health care a priority.\n\nIn fact, the commissioner's report noted that investment was increasing and there had been good progress in terms of tackling eating disorders with new services and strict targets for access.\n\nLast month, in his Budget, the chancellor announced at least \u00a32bn of the extra \u00a320bn earmarked for the NHS by 2023 would go on mental health.\n\nA new four-week target for access to CAMHS is also going to be piloted soon and NHS England has promised another 70,000 children will be able to access support in the coming years.\n\nNational mental health director Claire Murdoch said the scale of the problem identified by NHS Digital showed the importance of \"ramping up\" access to services.\n\nShe said the NHS long-term plan, due out soon, would set out more details about future investment.\n\n\"Everyone who works with children and young people, whether in the public, private or voluntary sector, has to play their part if we are to protect young people's mental wellbeing.\"\n\nMinisters have also being putting pressure on social media firms to do more about cyber-bullying and aggressive behaviour online.\n\nOne option being considered is a new regulator for the internet."

At the moment, she said, it was being left to parents and teachers to teach about the dangers of betting.\n\n'Out of sight'\n\nGambling Commission executive director Tim Miller called for a \"joined-up approach\" to keep children safe.\n\n\"There's no doubt that today's figures on children and gambling should make people sit up and listen,\" he said.\n\n\"But while discussions about children gambling might conjure up images of kids sneaking into bookies or sitting alone on their iPad gambling on an online casino, our latest research paints a more complex picture.\n\n\"The most common activities that children gamble on are not licensed casinos, bingo providers or bookies.\n\n\"Instead we found children preferred to gamble in informal environments, out of sight of regulation - private bets between friends or playing cards with their mates for money.\""

    "authors": [
      "Martha Henriques"
    ],
    "text": "Overweight people face a barrage of prejudice in many areas of life \u2013 from being less likely to be offered a job to being unfairly judged as lazy or weak-willed. In shops, for example, sales assistants are less likely to meet their eyes or smile.\n\nAn undercover shopping experiment has now shown that this bias even extends to the shapes of products that customers are recommended: customers of a greater weight are encouraged to buy rounder items.\n\nWhen an actor with a BMI within the healthy range went shopping for watches and perfume, she was offered a range of products from sales assistants. Two covert researchers shadowed the actor\u2019s progress without the shop assistants\u2019 knowledge, recording how angular or round the products they recommended were.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 The benefits of having a babyface\n\n\u2022 Five myths about the body\n\n\u2022 The air that makes you fat\n\nNext, the actor donned a professionally constructed body prosthesis that made her appear to be obese. She wore the same clothes as before in a larger size \u2013 a plain blue-green T-shirt layered over a long-sleeve white top, dark jeans and flip-flops. She went back to the shops, still trailed by the two researchers.\n\nIn total, she had 37 sales encounters, collecting up to three watch or perfume recommendations from each. After analysing the results, the researchers found that when wearing the prosthesis, the actor was recommended rounder watches and rounder bottles of perfume.\n\n\u201cOur thinking was these subtle prejudices that lead to these effects are based on something more than superficial shape-matching,\u201d says study author Beth Vallen, a researcher at Villanova University in the US.\n\nOnline experiments with study participants who weren\u2019t shop assistants confirmed the bias Vallen and her colleagues measured in the real-life setting. Participants were shown a picture of a potential customer and asked to recommend products, selecting from pairs of images that were either round or angular.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to show that this was a bias that reflects the thoughts and decisions processes of all people, not just sales people,\u201d says Vallen.\n\nThis turned out to be the case: they found the same effect of matching rounder products to people with a higher BMI. It also held across different types of products \u2013 from watches to mirrors, lamps and candles. And it happened whether the imaginary customer was male or female.\n\nThe bias goes beyond an urge to match people of a particular body type with a particular shape of product, the researchers suggest. Instead, they say it is the stereotypes associated with the product and the people that are at play.\n\nIn particular, one stereotype is that overweight people are friendlier. Rounded shapes are also seen as friendlier.\n\nThe researchers tested whether this stereotype caused the product recommendations, designing other experiments with actors behaving in a friendly or unfriendly way. Indeed, they found that the actors were recommended more rounded products when they were smiling than when they were stern-faced \u2013 an effect that held whether they were wearing a body prosthesis or not.\n\nThis prejudice may work against both people who are overweight and those who aren\u2019t.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t find any evidence that overweight people themselves prefer round products, or that normal weight people prefer angular products,\u201d says Vallen.\n\nAs a result, this bias may well mean that people end up being systematically recommended things they don\u2019t like, or not being recommended things they would.\n\nAnd similar biases may well apply in other areas of bias beyond weight, Vallen says.\n\n\u201cYou can look at gender, racial discrimination, people with babyfaces \u2013 I think there are a lot of different physical cues you could look at to see if there\u2019s this \u2018matching\u2019 in other contexts.\u201d\n\nOne way out of the problem? Training sales people to \u201cdig deeper\u201d, says Vallen, and find out what people actually like rather than making split-second judgments based on irrelevant factors like body size.\n\nOf course, this discovery is among the more harmless implications of weight bias. Having a slightly pointier or rounder lamp than you might have wanted probably isn\u2019t going to cause anyone a serious problem. But it is another a glimpse into just how much body size prejudice permeates our experiences in day-to-day life.\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "text": "We\u2019ve all seen how powerful images can make abstract crises feel concrete. Think of the photographs of a Chinese man blocking a column of tanks a day after the Tiananmen Square massacre, a naked Vietnamese girl fleeing from napalm in 1972 or of 7-year-old Amal Hussain wasting away from hunger in Yemen. When done well, photographs help people around the world make sense of unseen disasters.\n\nNow close your eyes and try to picture climate change \u2013 one of our generation\u2019s most pressing crises. What comes to mind? Is it smoke coming out of power plants? Solar panels? A skinny polar bear?\n\nThat\u2019s problematic, says psychologist Adam Corner, director of Climate Visuals, a project that aims to revitalise climate imagery. \u201cImages without people on them are unable to tell a human story,\u201d says Corner.\n\nAnd that kind of imagery might be a big part of why so few of us are prioritising climate action.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 What can I do about climate change?\n\n\u2022 The Arctic town that is melting away\n\n\u2022 How climate change will transform business and the work force\n\nClimate change has an inherent image problem. While you can clearly visualise plastic pollution or deforestation, climate change has a less obvious mugshot: the gases that cause global warming, such as carbon dioxide and methane, are colourless, while impacts are slow-paced and not always visually striking.\n\nSo in the 1990s, reporters, politicians and others began using the sort of imagery that would help us begin to grasp the situation. That idea helped us understand the subject then. But it now needs revamping. For one thing, climate impacts are more evident now: take the frequency of wildfires, coastal flooding, droughts and heat waves.\n\nBut another reason to update climate change\u2019s visuals is that, for the general public, \u2018traditional\u2019 climate images aren\u2019t that compelling.\n\nWondering if there was a better way to tell climate change stories, Climate Visuals tested what effect iconic climate images \u2013 like that lonely polar bear \u2013 really had.\n\nAfter asking people at panel groups in London and Berlin and through an online survey with over 3,000 people, the team concluded that people were more likely to empathise with images that showed real faces \u2013 such as workers installing solar panels, emergency respondents helping victims of a typhoon or farmers building more efficient irrigation systems to combat drought.\n\nIt also helped when photographs depicted settings that were local or familiar to the viewer, and when they showed emotionally powerful impacts of climate change.\n\nRespondents in their study were also cynical of \u2018staged\u2019 pictures\u2026 and of images with politicians.\n\nClimate Visuals\u2019 quest is not entirely new. For over a decade, scholars have analysed the way NGOs and governments represent climate change visually, examined how the public reacts to different types of images and come up with new approaches. What it\u2019s done differently, though, is to create the world\u2019s largest climate image library based on those lessons.\n\nAnd for better or for worse, it\u2019s no longer that difficult to find human-led photographs of the consequences of climate change.\n\n\u201cThe stories we need to tell are all around us in a way they were not 20 years ago when the polar bear became an icon,\u201d says Corner.\n\n--\n\nDiego Arguedas Ortiz is a science and climate change reporter for BBC Future.

    ],
    "text": "The number of sheep and cattle in the UK should be reduced by between a fifth and a half to help combat climate change, a report says.\n\nThe shift is needed, the government\u2019s advisory Committee on Climate Change (CCC) maintains, because beef and lamb produce most farm greenhouse gases.\n\nThe report foresees an increase in the number of pigs and chickens because these produce less methane.\n\nThe farm union NFU said it did not agree with reducing livestock numbers.\n\nBut environmentalists say the recommendations are too timid.\n\nThe CCC says a 20-50% reduction in beef and lamb pasture could release 3-7m hectares of grassland from the current 12m hectares in the UK.\n\nThe un-needed grassland could instead grow forests and biofuels that would help to soak up CO2.\n\nThe committee\u2019s advice on producing less red meat is less radical than NHS Eatwell guidelines on healthy eating, which proposes a reduction in consumption of 89% for beef and 63% for lamb, and a 20% decline in dairy products.\n\nBBC News understands that the committee have deliberately taken a more conservative position in order to minimise confrontation with the farmers\u2019 union, the NFU.\n\nTurning farmland into forests\n\nThe chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), Chris Stark, told BBC News: \u201cClimate change is going to change the way the UK looks \u2013 and we also have to alter the way we use land so we don\u2019t make climate change worse.\n\n\u201cBrexit offers the government the opportunity to introduce fundamentally new policies that will reward farmers for producing less greenhouse gases and for capturing carbon emissions.\u201d\n\nCarbon is stored in plants and in the soil, so the CCC recommends that farm subsidies should raise the proportion of UK land under forestry from 14% to 19%, and restore peat bogs.\n\nNFU President Minette Batters said: \"The NFU has been clear with its position on British farming's role in tackling climate change - reducing livestock numbers in the UK is not a part of that policy.\n\n\"We are disappointed to see the Committee on Climate Change include that recommendation in its report. The report simply does not recognise the environmental benefits grass-fed beef and sheep production brings to the UK.\n\n\"It would be a fundamental mistake to design a farming system solely around an approach that mitigates greenhouse gases without any regard to the wider impact of such a policy for our environment and our food supply. It risks producing a one-eyed policy.\"\n\nEarlier, the NFU had said that it welcomed the report's call for diversification of land use.\n\nWhat do environmentalists say?\n\nThe environmental campaigner George Monbiot told BBC News: \u201cThis is a timid and inadequate report. Roughly four million hectares of uplands is used for sheep, yet sheep account for just 1.2% of our diet.\n\n\u201cAllowing trees to return to a significant portion on this land has a far greater potential for carbon reduction than the puny measures proposed in this report.\u201d\n\nFriends of the Earth's Guy Shrubsole said: \"We need to reforest far more of Britain than the government's current puny tree-planting targets - going beyond what this report calls for and doubling forest cover to lock-up carbon and help prevent floods.\"\n\nThere may be controversy, too, over the committee\u2019s recommendation for the UK to grow more trees and plants to burn for energy \u2013 known as biomass.\n\nA separate CCC report says biomass can play an important role in cutting emissions in the UK \u2013 but only if it\u2019s produced in a way that doesn\u2019t harm the environment. It could only be used after 2030 if carbon capture equipment were fitted.\n\nHow climate change is already changing the landscape\n\nThe CCC says climate change is already changing the landscape. it says as UK temperatures have risen by 0.8\u00b0C over the last 40 years, farmers have made the impacts worse.\n\nLoss of soil fertility, plant and animal species are now apparent, it says, mainly driven by intensive food production.\n\nProjections suggest more warming, sea level rise, greater risks from flooding and drought.\n\n\"Despite some opportunities,\u201d the report says,\"The negative impacts on our soils, water, vegetation and wildlife are likely to be significant.\u201d\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter."

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Green in the new black\n\nWhen we go shopping, a lot of us try to save money.\n\nBut when you pick up that shopping basket, do you ever think about saving the planet?\n\nOk, so you already have a reusable bag but there are other ways to help the environment.\n\nThere's a lot of focus on how we can all do more as individuals, so here are Newsbeat's tips on how to be an eco-friendly shopper (and no, you don't have to be vegan).\n\nBring your own bottle\n\nBYOB is not just for parties. Some supermarkets are encouraging customers to bring their own containers.\n\nMorrisons and Tesco offer shoppers the option to have raw meat and fish weighed at the counter which can then be placed into their own containers. Tesco is also trialling in-store recycling machines which will pay customers for every plastic bottle returned.\n\nIn September, Lidl announced it would no longer be using black plastic for its fruit and veg range. Black plastic can't be easily scanned by recycling machines, which makes the process complicated.\n\nIt's not just the major retailers doing their bit. Local stores like The Clean Kilo supermarket in Digbeth, Birmingham class themselves as \"zero-waste supermarkets\".\n\nImage copyright The Clean Kilo Image caption The Clean Kilo supermarket allows customers to fill up their own containers\n\nShoppers bring in their own containers, which could be \"an old margarine tub or an old washing up liquid bottle\" says co-founder Tom Pell.\n\nContainers can be filled with products like pasta, cereals, rice and crisps. Your shopping is weighed and customers are charged accordingly.\n\nTom says shoppers should try to choose items with recyclable packaging.\n\n\"Quite often you'll get biscuits that are individually wrapped and have another big wrapper around them and then come in a multi-pack. It's those situations where it's almost ridiculous,\" he tells Newsbeat.\n\nDo you need a receipt?\n\nMany shops are no longer automatically tearing off a receipt at the till. Now, you're often asked if you actually need a receipt.\n\nProof of purchase is obviously necessary for those panic buys during lunch breaks that need to be returned.\n\nBut lots of high street stores now give the option to have a receipt emailed instead of a printed one.\n\nSome stores do still automatically roll out extra long receipts or multiple receipts including offers and vouchers.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Do you really need a printed receipt?\n\nIt's a lot of paper, which often goes to waste and some of it is not recyclable.\n\nThermal receipts are the ones on shiny paper which is coated with a substance called bisphenol A (BPA) or alternatively BPS.\n\nBoth substances have been banned from other plastic products because they can be harmful when ingested in large amounts. Thermal receipts end up in the bin because they can't be recycled.\n\nHow far has your food travelled?\n\nFood miles is the distance food has travelled to get to your plate. The further food has travelled, the greater the impact on the environment.\n\nThis is because of the pollution from carbon dioxide emissions, which comes from the vehicles transporting the food.\n\nBuying food from stores which stock products from local farmers can keep your food mileage down.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Do you know where your oranges have travelled from?\n\nShould you stay or should you go?\n\nOne way to cut down the mileage when you're shopping, is to stay indoors. Online shopping eliminates car trips and carbon emissions by using one delivery van for multiple shoppers. But....\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Add items to shopping basket, add more items, choose free delivery, click checkout\n\n....anyone who's ordered clothes online will know, many parcels arrive as a plastic bag.\n\nInside, each item is usually individually wrapped in another plastic bag. The package will also contain a large, often A4, paper receipt with various thermal labels. You've probably noticed there'll also be other papers thrown in - promotional flyers, offers, samples, etc.\n\nGreen is the new black\n\nInstead of buying new clothes, think about second hand options and recycling your unwanted outfits.\n\nFashion bloggers and influencers are all over our timelines wearing a new outfit for every post #outfitoftheday. That's a lot of clothes, but where do they end up?\n\n\"At the moment in the UK, 50 trailers of clothes go to the UK landfill every single day. We're talking a vast amount,\" says Jack Ostrowski, the founder and CEO of the reGAIN app.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption #outfitoftheday #instafashion #lookoftheday\n\nWith the reGAIN app, you can recycle unwanted clothes in exchange for discounts for many different retailers.\n\nThere are lots of other apps which fashion bloggers use to sell their second hand clothes, like Depop and Poshmark.\n\nMany councils also have information about your local textile bank to recycle clothes.\n\nJack Ostrowski told Newsbeat the aim is to create a circular fashion shopping habit - \"so people can buy but then actually find a way of recycling. Rather than throwing clothes into the bin they can either be reused or recycled or upcycled\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to eradicate all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042\n\nTheresa May has made a 25-year plan to protect the environment. \"In the UK alone, the amount of single-use plastic wasted every year would fill 1,000 Royal Albert Halls,\" she said.\n\nThe Prime Minister has pledged to eradicate all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here."

She later retracted her confession.\n\nRomanian authorities were given a canvas on Saturday night, thinking it \"might be\" Picasso's painting, which is estimated to be worth \u20ac800,000 (\u00a3710,000).\n\nDutch writer Mira Feticu had dug up the artwork wrapped in plastic in a Romanian forest, after receiving an anonymous letter around 10 days before.\n\nOn Sunday however, Ms Feticu, who is of Romanian origin, told news agency AFP the tip-off \"with instructions regarding the place where the painting was hidden\" was a \"publicity stunt\".\n\nShe told Dutch public broadcaster NOS she was duped as part of a \"performance\" by two Belgian directors who emailed to explain the letter was part of a project called True Copy, dedicated to the notorious Dutch forger Geert Jan Jansen.\n\nThe master forger spent decades making fake paintings, and selling them off as original Picassos, Klimts and Appels before he was finally caught in 1994.\n\nThe production company says on its website it would not comment further for the time being."

    "text": "Image copyright Luke McSweeney Image caption Rachael Miller believes the Cora Ball could hugely reduce microfibre pollution\n\nConcern is mounting over the volume of plastics in our oceans and, in particular, how tiny particles of plastic and other synthetic materials are infiltrating every part of our ecosystem. Can technology help address the problem?\n\nIn October 2009, windsurfing teacher Rachael Miller went to help clean up an island off the coast of Maine in the north-east of the US.\n\nThere had been a heavy storm and \"we found the beach covered in debris\", she says, mostly washed up plastic fishing gear.\n\nHer husband was incensed. \"Marine debris is one of the few things that really make me angry,\" he said.\n\nSo Ms Miller, who had studied marine archaeology, decided to devote herself to keeping plastics from ever reaching the ocean.\n\nIn April, she began selling a special gadget for capturing those tiny bits of synthetic material - called microfibres - that come off our clothes in the wash.\n\nFour inches (10cm) in diameter and made from recycled and recyclable plastic, the Cora Ball imitates the structure of coral in the ocean. While it doesn't catch everything, the company says it captures between a quarter and a third of microfibres in every wash.\n\nImage copyright David A. Seaver Image caption Cora Ball founder Rachael Miller works to prevent microplastics entering the oceans\n\nCustomers on the crowdfunding site Kickstarter pre-ordered 15,500 of these in 2017.\n\nCora Ball is one of several small start-ups working to keep microplastics and other microfibres out of the water system.\n\nThe shocking truth is that we could be ingesting 11,000 pieces of plastic a year just through eating shellfish, says Ghent University's Lisbeth Van Cauwenberghe.\n\nIt's a pollution we all contribute to when we wash our clothes.\n\nUp to 700,000 microfibres can shed from a typical 6kg (13lb) household load, says Imogen Napper, a postdoctoral marine science researcher at the University of Plymouth in the UK.\n\nAnd a sizable minority can make it into the ocean. So laundry is turning oceans into \"a big plastic soup\", says Ms Napper.\n\nHow can I stop my washing putting plastic into the sea?\n\nImage copyright IMOGEN NAPPER Image caption Marine scientist Imogen Napper says laundry is a big contributor to microfibres in the oceans\n\nMany of these fibres, which can be as small as three microns, a thirteenth the width of a human hair - are too small for water treatment plants to remove.\n\nDespite being so small, organic pollutants in the oceans, like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (DDT), can stick to them, creating a nasty amalgam.\n\nThere can be as many as 100,000 microplastics in a cubic metre of ocean, researchers say, which are then eaten by marine creatures.\n\nMore than two thirds of fish species in California markets have microfibres in them, says Chelsea Rochman, an aquatic ecology professor at the University of Toronto.\n\nTwo other people working to keep microfibres out of the water are Alexander Nolte and his friend Oliver Spies, both enthusiastic surfers from Berlin.\n\nThey invented a laundry bag called Guppyfriend after coming up with the idea while brainstorming at a beer garden, says Mr Nolte.\n\nImage copyright Guppyfriend Image caption The Guppyfriend bag collects microfibres shed from synthetic clothes in the wash\n\nThe bag cushions clothes to release fewer plastic fibres, and catches those that form, he says.\n\n\"If you wash synthetic textiles, there are 86% fewer fibres that break, and those that do break are in the bag,\" Mr Nolte explains.\n\nLike Cora Ball, they started with a Kickstarter campaign, which closed in December.\n\nAt first they thought the bag was a \"quite amusing idea, and we can bring it to market very quickly,\" says Mr Nolte, \"and we were fundamentally wrong.\"\n\nThe biggest challenge, he says, was to get openings in the bag the right size to let in enough water, without letting microfibres escape.\n\n\"It is pretty easy to make a bag, but to do it in a way that gets the filament right to reduce fibre shedding is pretty high tech,\" Mr Nolte observes.\n\nMore Technology of Business\n\nIn Denmark, 60% of all sewage sludge is \"getting used in agriculture,\" says Lars Monster from the KD Group, a wastewater tech company in the southern Danish town of Vejle.\n\nThese solid remnants from waste water treatment are distributed on farmland as fertiliser. But plastics in the sludge then enter the food chain.\n\nOne problem is that most wastewater treatment plants don't aim to remove microfibres, largely because regulations don't require them to.\n\nSo Mr Monster's company has developed a new filtration technology that can remove 90% of microplastics, he says. He's hoping to get the figure up to 96%.\n\nThe ultimate aim is to recycle all the removed plastics, says Mr Monster, and \"get to the point where microplastics are a resource\".\n\nFour science and bioengineering students at London's Imperial College won a prize in October for coming up with an inexpensive way to remove microplastics from wastewater.\n\nImage copyright Imperial College London Image caption Students Jedidiah Cheung and Dario Mongiardi are working on filtering out microplastics\n\nIntroducing an additional compound to the filtration stage of treatment could remove upwards of 99% of microplastics cheaply without retrofitting a treatment centre, says Dario Mongiardi, one of the students.\n\nCora Ball's Ms Miller - who also runs a clean-water non-profit, the Rozalia Project - says these laundry and wastewater treatment technologies are complementary.\n\nIf just 10% of US households used Cora Ball it would keep the equivalent of 30 million water bottles from washing into public waterways a year, claims Rachael Miller.\n\n\"If you eat or drink or wear clothes or use objects,\" she says, \"this affects you.\""

The problem is what happens to them next.\n\nWet wipes are behind up to 80% of blockages in UK sewers, a key element of the infamous giant obstacles known as fatbergs, according to water companies.\n\nThey say it costs \u00a3100m a year to deal with them.\n\nSkips full of wipes are caught by the filters at water treatment works and end up in landfill.\n\nFrom their treatment sites across the North West, United Utilities collect around 12,000 tonnes of wipes and other rubbish every year.\n\nImage caption Wet wipes causing a blockage at a house on the outskirts of Manchester\n\nTony Griffiths, from United Utilities, said: \"It's extremely frustrating. The amount of money that gets spent on dealing with blockages and disposing of this material could be reinvested in our ageing infrastructure.\"\n\nHe added: \"If we're not spending all this money, we could actually work to reduce customer bills.\"\n\nSome in the water industry are losing patience.\n\nMatt Wheeldon, a director at Wessex Water, has been pushing for action to prevent wipes being labelled as flushable.\n\nHe said: \"I think they're a complete scourge on our society.\n\n\"Whoever came up with the bad idea didn't think about the impact they're going to have on the environment.\"\n\nHe added that it was \"technically illegal to put anything down the toilet that's going to block up the sewer\".\n\n\"Despite what the label says, these wipes definitely shouldn't be flushed down the toilet,\" agrees Natalie Fee, founder of campaign organisation City to Sea.\n\nShe points out that most manufacturers specify that so-called flushable wipes should only be flushed \"one at a time\".\n\n\"Manufacturers clearly know this is a problem. We need to start seeing them change what they say [on the packaging]. It can be confusing for consumers,\" she told BBC News.\n\nDeadly consequences\n\nMeanwhile, wipes which escape the filters have an even greater environmental impact, ending up in rivers and on beaches.\n\nThe wipes contain tiny plastic fibres which go on to harm fish and other marine life as the fibres are released and ingested, sometimes with deadly consequences.\n\nIn addition, the plastic fibres might then go on to be consumed by other animals potentially entering the human food chain.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Wet wipes clogging up London sewers\n\nThames21 is an environmental charity which organises clear-ups of wet wipes from the banks of the Thames.\n\nIn the first six months of 2018, volunteers picked up around 120,000 wet wipes from one stretch of the riverbank near Hammersmith Bridge.\n\nAJ McConville, from the charity, said: \"The wet wipes are changing the shape of the foreshore.\n\n\"What seems to be happening is that wet wipes are getting snagged on something, and then they will slow down the water around them by creating turbulence, and by doing that they therefore attract even more wet wipes and more sediment to accumulate around them.\"\n\nImage caption Wet wipes on the riverbed of the Thames at low tide\n\nManufacturers have made efforts to improve the packaging of non-flushable wipes, making the \"do not flush\" logo larger and more prominent.\n\nBut it is the wipes marked \"flushable\" where there is disagreement.\n\nScientists at WRC, a water-testing laboratory in Swindon, carry out tests on wet wipes to assess their ability to disintegrate when they are flushed into the sewers.\n\nThey put wipes into conical flasks full of water and rotate them on a shaking platform - which they believe mimics the turbulence of water conditions in a sewer.\n\nUsing this technique, they have found that none of the wipes marked \"flushable\" which are currently available for sale in the UK pass the test.\n\nThere is hope on the horizon though. They also test new products still in development, and have found some wipes which do break down - but none of these are yet available on the UK market.\n\nThe manufacturers use a different test. It is more vigorous, and means that wipes break up more quickly.\n\nSome water industry experts likened this to putting the wipes in a washing machine, and said it didn't realistically reflect what happened in the sewers.\n\nImage caption There are many brands of wet wipes available, but only some of them are marketed as 'flushable'\n\nBut the manufacturers insisted their test was adequate, and believed that wipes marked \"flushable\" weren't the problem.\n\nLast year, the government asked the manufacturers and water companies to agree a flushable standard.\n\nBut these efforts have failed, leaving the water companies to insist that only three 'Ps' should go down the toilet: pee, poo and paper.\n\nHear more on Costing The Earth on BBC Radio 4 on 13 November at 15:30 BST, repeated on 14 November at 21:00."

    "text": "Susie McKinnon doesn\u2019t remember being a child or remember being any age other than she is now: in her 60s. She can\u2019t remember special events, either. She knows she went to her nephew\u2019s wedding. She knows her husband went with her. But she can\u2019t actually remember being there.\n\nIn fact, she has very few memories from her life \u2013 but she doesn\u2019t have amnesia.\n\nFor many years, McKinnon had no idea she was different. We tend to assume our minds work in the same way. We don\u2019t often discuss what having a memory feels like. McKinnon assumed that when people told in-depth stories about their past, they were just making up the details to entertain people. But then a friend who was training in medicine asked if she could try out a memory test on her as part of her of studies. This is when both of them realised McKinnon\u2019s autobiographical memory was lacking.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 An effortless way to improve your memory\n\n\u2022 The woman who can\u2019t forget\n\n\u2022 How it feels to learn your memories are fiction\n\nMcKinnon researched amnesia, but the stories of people who lost their memories as a result of illness or brain injuries didn\u2019t seem to fit her experience. She could remember that events had happened; she just didn\u2019t recall what it was like to be there. A little more than a decade ago, after breaking her foot and having little to fill her time, she began reading about research on mental time travel and made the decision to contact a research scientist working in the field.\n\nShe was nervous the day she sent an email to Brian Levine, a memory scientist at the Rotman Research Institute at Baycrest in Toronto. Levine called it was one of the most exciting days of his career. The result of their communication was the identification of a new syndrome \u2013 Severely Deficient Autobiographical Memory.\n\nHumans have the extraordinary ability to mentally time travel, going backwards and forwards in our minds at will. Think back to being in the classroom at primary school, or imagine that next weekend you\u2019re sitting on a beach towel watching dolphins cross the horizon. It\u2019s probably not just the facts about those situations that you imagine; you picture the actual experience of being there. This is what McKinnon is unable to do.\n\nAs Brian Levine told me on All in the Mind on BBC radio, \u201cFor her, past events are experienced almost as if they were in the third person, as if they could have been someone else\u2019s past episodes.\u201d\n\nTo an extent we all do this, forgetting most things that happen to us, but for McKinnon it\u2019s much more extreme.\n\nThis syndrome is very different from amnesia, which usually occurs after a particular event or brain injury, and makes it difficult for the person to retain new information in order to make new memories. People with Severely Deficient Autobiographical Memory or SDAM can learn and retain new information \u2013 but that information is devoid of the richness of real life experience. If McKinnon can remember details about an event, it\u2019s because she\u2019s seen a photo or deliberately learnt a story about what happened. She can\u2019t picture being there or what she was wearing or who she was with.\n\nInside my head I don\u2019t have any proof that I was there. It doesn\u2019t feel like something I did \u2013 Susie McKinnon\n\nAs she said to me on All in the Mind, \u201cIt could just have well have been somebody else attending a family wedding and not me. Inside my head I don\u2019t have any proof that I was there. It doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s something that I did.\u201d\n\nThis means McKinnon can\u2019t experience the nostalgia of reliving the best times in life \u2013 but the upside is that she can\u2019t recall the pain associated with the bad things either. Something difficult like the death of a family member feels just as intense at the time, but the feeling soon fades. And it could make her a nicer person too. She doesn\u2019t hold grudges, because she can\u2019t conjure up the emotion that made her feel bad in the first place.\n\nAs for the cause, so far researchers can\u2019t find any disease or injury associated with the condition and have to conclude that people are probably born with it. But Levine and his team are studying possible links with other conditions.\n\nMcKinnon also has aphantasia, which means she can\u2019t picture images. (Find out more about aphantasia and the people whose minds are \u2018blind\u2019). Is this preventing her from holding rich recollections of events in mind, compared to other people? It\u2019s hard to know for sure. Decades of memory research have shown that we reconstruct an event in our minds each time we recall it \u2013 but we don\u2019t know if we all do this in the same way. Some people might see an image or video in the mind\u2019s eye; others might think more in terms of abstract ideas or facts.\n\nCatherine Loveday, professor of cognitive neuroscience at the University of Westminster, wonders whether there are parallels with our memory of very early life. We are able to describe events that happened to us before the age of three, because we might have heard a lot about them or seen photos. But we find it difficult to recall what the experience felt like.\n\nAt the moment the prevalence of SDAM is unknown, although Levine and his team are trying to find out, with an online survey. Five thousand people have already taken part, with many saying they believe they have this condition. This is of course a self-selecting sample, but the numbers suggest it might not be rare.\n\nLevine\u2019s team is investigating the idea that autobiographical memory might lie on a spectrum. SDAM might lie at one end, while people with highly superior autobiographical memory who barely forget anything, however mundane, are at the other.\n\nSo does it matter if you have this condition? If it\u2019s not affecting the way you live your life, probably not.\n\nI really am in the moment all the time \u2013 McKinnon\n\nFor McKinnon, she\u2019s always lived like this \u2013 so knowing that it\u2019s an actual condition which has probably been with her all her life is simply interesting and makes sense of the differences she\u2019s sometimes noticed between her and other people. And she now understands that other people are not making up stories. \u201cI\u2019ve never had it any other way. So for me it\u2019s not a loss,\u201d she says. \u201cSince I\u2019ve never really had that ability, I can\u2019t really feel the lack of it.\u201d\n\nAnd McKinnon sees another advantage of not being about to dwell on the past or daydream about the future: \u201cI know that a lot of people strive for that notion of really being in the moment, but it\u2019s effortless for me because it\u2019s the only way my brain operates. So I really am in the moment all the time.\u201d\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

That's the hope of scientists who are scrambling to reverse the dramatic declines in bee populations.\n\nBees are in trouble, but we're not quite sure why.\n\nIt could be the overuse of insecticides; air pollution; warming temperatures; the varroa destructor mite; or even interference from electromagnetic radiation.\n\nOr it could be a combination of all these factors. But until we have more data, we won't know for sure.\n\nSo the World Bee Project and IT firm Oracle are creating a global network of AI \"smart hives\" to give scientists real-time data into the relationships between bees and their environments.\n\nUp to six sensors will be mounted on hives, capturing the sound of the bees' buzzing, the movement of their feet and wings, the weight of their honey, the hive's humidity, as well as local weather and pollution levels.\n\nImage copyright Christina Shand Image caption Sensors will provide data on sound, temperature, humidity and weight of honey in a hive\n\nSensors on beehives aren't new, but using AI and machine learning to analyse the data they collect should yield new insights, says John Abel, vice-president of cloud and technology at Oracle.\n\n\"Sound is probably the most important data set,\" he says.\n\n\"We convert it into a data feed and use this via machine learning to inform the beekeeper. And with Oracle Cloud we can get lots of data into it very quickly - we've got technology which is self-learning, self-tuning and self-patching, so it can automate what it needs to do.\"\n\nOracle - which says the data will be owned by the World Bee Project - will use blockchain to verify that the data is coming from a particular hive and hasn't been tampered with.\n\nSimon Potts, professor of biodiversity at Reading University, says it can be quite hard with simple laboratory or field experiments to tease out what is affecting bees.\n\nImage copyright Reading University Image caption \"Honey bees are the single most important pollinator on the planet,\" says Simon Potts\n\n\"With AI and machine learning we can start to put together the signature of health and unhealthy hives,\" he says.\n\n\"The holy grail would be to indentify early warning indicators of problems.\"\n\nFor instance, when bees swarm, the existing hive can lose half its population and half of its honey, as those bees about to leave will gorge themselves first.\n\nSo beekeepers want to minimise swarming.\n\nBees often swarm due to inadequate ventilation or high temperatures, so having live data on humidity, temperature and the weight of a hive's honey would all give early indications of problems.\n\nA beekeeper would then be able to take preventative action.\n\nWhy are bees so important?\n\nBees are crucial for agriculture: 1.4 billion farming jobs and three-quarters of the world's food supply - worth about $577bn (\u00a3447bn) a year - depend on the pollination of crops.\n\nAnd of the 100 crop species that feed 90% of the world's population, 70 are pollinated by domesticated and wild bees.\n\n\"Honey bees are the single most important pollinator on the planet,\" says Prof Simon Potts.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Honey bee numbers have fallen dramatically in the UK in the past 70 years\n\nIn the past 50 years, the volume of agricultural production dependent on pollination has risen by 300%, yet at the same time bee populations have plunged.\n\nIn the UK, for instance, the number of honey bees fell by 54% between 1985 and 2005. In the US the number of honey-producing bee colonies fell from 5.9 million to 2.4 million between 1947 and 2008 - a fall of 59%.\n\n\"Over-industrialisation, the use of pesticides, the destruction of natural habitats and climate change are all behind this,\" says Sabiha Rumani Malik, founder and executive president of the World Bee Project, which aims to monitor the health of bees across the planet.\n\nImage copyright World Bee Project Image caption World Bee Project founder Sabiha Malik believes climate change has contributed to bee decline\n\nMore than 40% of invertebrate pollinator species - particularly bees and butterflies - are facing extinction, and the potential impact of this on agricultural production is just one of the factors behind last year's stark warning on global food security from the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).\n\nYet what scientists have lacked is a comprehensive set of data to analyse the rates of bee declines in different regions of the world and the differing reasons for this.\n\nIn the UK, an invasive species that is now threatening bees is the Asian hornet. Whereas in Asia when the much larger hornet enters a hive, eastern honey bees can surround it and effectively cook it (and themselves) to death by raising their own body temperatures - European honey bees have not developed this defence mechanism.\n\nLive monitoring would again allow earlier action to be taken in removing such predators.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Asian hornet is considered to be a threat to the honey\n\nIn Manchester, Cisco and the city's Mi-Idea innovation centre have partnered with Australia's data innovation group, Data61, to track bees' movements by using IoT technology.\n\nThe team wants to understand phenomena such as colony collapse disorder, which sees the worker bees disappearing and leaving the queen isolated.\n\nThe project fits RFID [radio-frequency identification] chips safely onto individual bees so researchers can record their movements.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Bees 'go online' in Manchester\n\n\"We need to increase food production in the next two decades and we have declining bee populations around the world,\" says Peter Carter at Data61.\n\n\"So we're using the data analytics and machine learning to accelerate the rate at which we're making discoveries. We can then make smart decisions about where we invest our human resources, our scientists.\"\n\nMore Technology of Business\n\nOnce the AI has been taught what to look for on UK bee hives, the World Bee Project plans to roll out these smart hives globally. Farmers and beekeepers around the world have already expressed interest in joining the AI hive network.\n\n\"Every additional hive we connect gives us hundreds of thousands more data points,\" says Oracle's John Abel. \"It will get more and more accurate.\"\n\nThe aim is to attune the AI to different environments.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Beekeeping in Ethiopia. The country is Africa's largest honey producer\n\n\"The challenge for a beekeeper in, say Burkina Faso, is different from one outside London,\" says Mr Potts.\n\n\"There will be some general points that all honey bees respond to, but that won't tell us the full story, so we will have to work with local keepers.\"\n\nSabiha Malik is hopeful: \"Technology can allow us to move swiftly and make a significant change. With collaboration we can arrest the decline of bees and improve the situation.\""

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption People in Manchester explain why \"freakshakes\" hold such appeal\n\nThe campaign group Action on Sugar is demanding a ban on freakshakes and all milkshakes with more than 300 calories.\n\nIt surveyed milkshakes sold in restaurants and fast food shops in the UK and found they contained \"grotesque levels of sugar and calories\".\n\nFreakshakes are milkshakes that also contain chocolates, sweets, cake, cream and sauce.\n\nThe Toby Carvery Unicorn Freakshake came top of the survey with 39 teaspoons of sugar or 1,280 calories.\n\nThat is more than half the daily recommended amount of calories for an adult and over six times the amount of sugar recommended for seven to 10-year-olds.\n\nIn terms of sugar, it is the equivalent of drinking more than five cans of cola.\n\nThe British Heart Foundation calculates an average 25-year-old would need to jog for nearly three hours or vacuum the house for five hours to burn off the calories.\n\nThe researchers found that many other shakes contain more than half the daily recommended amount of calories for an adult.\n\nThey say that of the 46 products included in the survey with nutrition labelling available online, all would receive a red/high label for excessive levels of sugar per serving.\n\nAction on Sugar, which is made up of specialists concerned with sugar and its effects on health, are calling for mandatory traffic light-coloured nutrition labelling across all menus.\n\nThe government is currently consulting on menu calorie labelling.\n\nPublic Health England (PHE) also has a sugar reduction programme as part of the government's childhood obesity plan. It is challenging businesses to cut sugar by 20% by 2020 and milkshakes are included in that.\n\nAction on Sugar chairman Graham MacGregor, professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at London's Queen Mary University, said that does not go far enough.\n\n\"These very high calorie drinks, if consumed on a daily basis, would result in children becoming obese and suffering from tooth decay - that is not acceptable,\" he said.\n\n\"These high calorie milkshakes need to be reduced immediately below 300kcal per serving.\"\n\nRegistered nutritionist Kawther Hashem, a researcher at Action on Sugar based at Queen Mary, said it was \"shocking this information is hidden from the consumer, who would struggle to find it\".\n\nShe said it was \"time the government introduced legislation to force companies to be more transparent about what is in their products\".\n\nDr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE, said: \"The food and drink industry - including restaurants, manufacturers and retailers - has a key role in helping to tackle this, by reducing the amount of sugar we buy and consume, and we hope to see them step up to the challenge.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nFreakshakes were invented in Australia, but have become increasingly popular in the UK in recent years and with their photogenic qualities are a popular posting on social media.\n\nThe Toby Carvery Unicorn Freakshake is made with grape and raspberry flavoured ice cream, blackcurrant jelly pieces, milk, freshly whipped cream and topped with marshmallow, skittles and almond macaroon.\n\nToby Carvery had two freakshakes in the top 10 of the survey, as did Harvester.\n\nBoth companies told the BBC that they shared their nutritional information online, took their nutritional responsibilities seriously, had committed to PHE's sugar reduction programme and also were not targeting children with their shakes.\n\nA Toby Carvery spokesperson added: \"We also regularly work with our suppliers to explore ways we can reduce sugar levels in our dishes.\"\n\nAnd a Harvester spokesperson said: \"We have also been recognised by the Soil Association Out to Lunch campaign for continuing to develop our children's menu and offering healthier choices for young guests.\"\n\nSupermarkets\n\nAction on Sugar also looked at supermarket milkshakes and found that 90% of the 41 products surveyed would receive a red/high label for excessive levels of sugars.\n\nThe top three for sugars and calories were Muller Milk Frijj in chocolate, fudge brownie and cookie dough flavour.\n\nA spokesperson for Muller said: \"We know that for health conscious consumers, the choice of reduced sugar is important, without compromising on taste. That's why we introduced a Frijj zero added sugar range.\n\n\"Milk contains naturally occurring sugars in the form of lactose but we would stress that it is also a natural and nutrient rich product, containing essential nutrients such as protein, calcium and vitamins.\""

    "title": "Five myths about wildfires",
    "authors": [
      "Diego Arguedas Ortiz"
    ],
    "text": "Wildfires are currently raging through California, with thousands of people forced to flee their homes and dozens of residents killed. Earlier this year, a series of wildfires in the Greek coast killed 99 people in the deadliest wildfire worldwide since 2009. In July 2018, smoke from fires in Russia reached as far as North America. This is a new normal.\n\nBut as fires multiply around the world, so do questions about them \u2013 and misconceptions. Here are five common myths about wildfires \u2013 some of which can undermine our success in fighting them.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 The quest to predict \u2013 and stop \u2013 the spread of wildfires\n\n\u2022 Ten simple ways to act on climate change\n\n\u2022 The jaw-dropping missions of fire-fighting pilots\n\nMyth #1: Regularly logging forests prevents forest fires\n\nA common assumption is that logging, or removing some trees, would prevent fires. In fact, many forest experts say that logging is ineffective. This is because the tree remnants left over after logging, such as stumps and branches, provide a super-fuel for fire \u2013 one that is even drier (and more flammable) in the absence of a forest canopy.\n\nThere is plenty of science backing these claims. For instance, a recent study showed that burn severity tended to be higher in areas with higher levels of management. Scholars working on wildfire conservation have also rebuked arguments that logging protects endangered species from forest fires, a common argument in favour of tree removal; in fact, it seems that animals like the iconic spotted owl still benefit from a burned-out forest and that removing the trees could hurt them. Even post-fire logging is counterproductive and can lead to more fires.\n\nA different practice is clearing entire areas of a forest, a common approach used by firefighters to prevent the fire from spreading.\n\nMyth #2: There is nothing you can do to protect your property\n\nWildfires are powerful and threatening, but households can reduce their risk by taking action at home. The building itself should be the first concern. Houses with fire-resistant roofs stand a better chance of surviving a blaze. Owners also should remove combustible materials from around the structure, including leaves in gutters and rooflines.\n\nFamilies can create a \u2018defensible zone\u2019 between their homes and their surrounding wilderness. This means clearing anything that could catch fire, like brush, dried leaves and wood piles within 30 feet (9m) of structures. When they are 30-100 feet (9-30m) away from homes, trees should have large distances between canopies \u2013 12 feet (3.6m) of space between tops that are between 30-60ft (9-18m) from a home, and 6 feet (1.8m) of space for tops that are 60 feet (18m) away. This interrupts the fire\u2019s path and slows its pace.\n\nMyth #3: Wildfires are an inevitable fact of nature\n\nWhile wildfires are a natural phenomenon, the extent and intensity to which they\u2019re happening now are not \u2013 and one of the effects of climate change.\n\nWe saw fewer fires between 1930 and 1980, a period that coincided with cooler and moister conditions. But as the climate has become hotter and drier in the last four decades, the number of fires have increased. In only two years between 1980 and 1999 did wildfires burn more than 6 million acres (2.4m hectares) of US wilderness. But between 2000 and 2017, there were 10 years with burnt acreage above that threshold.\n\nGlobally, the length of the wildfire season increased by nearly 19% between 1978 and 2013.\n\nWhile you can\u2019t point to climate change as causing any particular fire on its own, it does influence factors that help spark and spread fires, like major drought, high temperatures, low humidity and high winds. As a result, scientists say that the increase of wildfires around the world, from Siberia to Portugal, is linked to climate change.\n\nMyth #4: All wildfires are bad and must be quenched immediately\n\nFires have played a crucial role in ecosystems for millennia and life has evolved beside them: some beetles breed only in the heat of fires, pine cones germinate with periodical fires and cleared space from burnt trees allows for new plants to spring.\n\nIn fact, the benefits that many people now hope to achieve with logging or forest management \u2013 the clearing of dense woods \u2013 is naturally done by forest fires. The flames periodically consume smaller branches and trees, culling the forest which otherwise would otherwise serve as fuel.\n\nBy fighting wildfires relentlessly during the past century, we have prevented this \u2018cleansing\u2019: less than 1% of US fires are allowed to burn. This strategy works better when there are fewer wildfires \u2013 but in our current extreme conditions, pumping more money to fighting fires might have a diminishing rate of returns.\n\nMyth #5: It is possible to eradicate (or control) all wildfires\n\nAs we have already seen, climate change, alongside other factors such as the spread of human settlements, is expected to increase wildfires, particularly in mid-to-high latitudes, in the coming decades. The tropics might see a decrease in fires, which might come as a relief for countries nearer the equator. But the rest of the globe would have to deal with an increasing number of them.\n\nSome fires, like California\u2019s Camp Fire, are too fast to be managed. Evacuation and relocation are the only reasonable responses. This leads to the question of whether communities like Paradise, which was destroyed almost entirely by the fire, should stay where they are \u2013 or move elsewhere.\n\nSome experts are calling for a return to traditional indigenous fire knowledge to deal with the flames. As efforts to cull fires seem insufficient \u2013 and as fires are likely to only get worse \u2013 those are questions policymakers must face.\n\n--\n\nDiego Arguedas Ortiz is a science and climate change reporter for BBC Future.

    "text": "Image copyright Peter Daniel Image caption Juan Mino was reunited with Kiara in Bangor more than a year after she was stolen from his garden in London\n\nAn 11-year-old dog has been found nearly 300 miles from home more than a year after she was stolen.\n\nPomeranian Kiara was taken from her garden in London in August 2017.\n\nBut when two stray dogs wandered into Peter Daniel's house in Bangor, Gwynedd, he was able to find Kiara's owners Juan and Antoinette Mino via her microchip and reunite the family.\n\nMrs Mino said she was \"so thankful\" her precious pooch had been found after she had given up hope.\n\nMr Daniel said he spotted two dogs going through his bins on Saturday while he got ready to go to his work, before one of them - Kiara - walked into his house and made herself at home.\n\nAfter he put out posts on lost dog groups on social media, Tess Jones volunteered to scan the dogs for microchips on Sunday - and while the other dog did not have one, Kiara's contained a phone number for her owners.\n\n\"They couldn't get their heads around it, I can't believe it myself,\" Mr Daniel said.\n\n\"While I was on the phone to the lady that owned the dog, her partner was getting in the car to drive the six or seven hours up here.\"\n\nImage copyright Antoinette Mino Image caption Kiara at home in London before she was stolen last year\n\nCo-operative worker Mr Daniel said when Mr Mino was reunited with Kiara, there was not a dry eye in the house.\n\n\"It was lovely,\" he said.\n\n\"I think we all shed a tear. Dogs are family members.\"\n\nWhen Kiara was taken, Mr and Mrs Mino printed 500 lost dog posters, offered a reward and kept across lost dog agencies and councils.\n\nBut after a year went by with two false alarms and no sign of Kiara, they gave up hope - until this weekend.\n\n'Christmas miracle'\n\nFinally reunited with her dog on Monday, Mrs Mino said she had spent more than a year haunted by thoughts of Kiara being abused or killed.\n\n\"I've just been crying for days, I am so thankful,\" she said.\n\n\"We are animal lovers and we have had dogs who have died before but with Kiara, we were always thinking 'what's happened to her? Was she ill-treated? Was she killed? Are they hitting her?'\n\n\"My husband was home when she was stolen and he always felt guilty.\n\nImage copyright Peter Daniel Image caption Peter Daniel with the other stray dog who he has now fostered\n\n\"It is so nice to have her back.\"\n\nBut alongside the celebrations, Kiara will need some tender loving care while she recovers.\n\n\"She came home in such a state, and she smells, apparently she was with another dog and they had been living rough for months.\"\n\nMrs Mino added Kiara's coat is in knots and she will have to be shaved by a vet, along with needing health checks and vaccinations.\n\nBut Mr Daniel's life has also been changed after finding the dogs - as he is now fostering Kiara's stray friend with a view to permanently adopting the Jack Russell if its owners cannot be found.\n\nHe described the weekend's events as a \"Christmas miracle\"."

    ],
    "text": "When I was 19 years old, after five years of back-and-forth trips that grew longer each time, I finally relocated officially from the United States to France. Already armed with a fairly good grasp of the language, I was convinced that I would soon assimilate into French culture.\n\nOf course, I was wrong. There\u2019s nothing like cultural nuance to remind you who you are at your core: my Americanness became all the more perceptible the longer I remained in France, and perhaps no more so than the day a French teacher told me his theory on the key distinction between those from my native and adopted lands.\n\n\u201cYou Americans,\u201d he said, \u201clive in the faire [to do]. The avoir [to have]. In France, we live in the \u00eatre [to be].\u201d\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 Why Finnish people don\u2019t like to chat\n\n\u2022 The odd philosophy Icelanders live by\n\n\u2022 Why people think Germans aren\u2019t funny\n\nThe moment he said it, it made perfect sense. I thought back to my life in New York, where every moment was devoted to checking tasks off a perpetual to-do list or planning for the days, weeks and years to come. In France, however, people were perfectly contented to just be.\n\nDuring two-hour lunch breaks, they sat at sidewalk cafes and watched the world pass them by. Small talk was made up not of what they did for a living, but where they had recently been on holiday. Women working at the post office chatted lazily with one another as the queue ticked slowly forward, enjoying the company of their co-workers while I impatiently waited to buy stamps so that I could fulfil my self-assigned obligation of sending postcards home.\n\nI wanted very badly to blend in and live in the \u00eatre, but it was harder than it looked. It seemed that no matter what I did, I exposed myself as an American. I smiled too much. I spoke too loudly. And I got excited way too often.\n\nI knew before moving that the French word \u2018excit\u00e9\u2019 was verboten. It is one of the first \u2018false friends\u2019 that a student of the language becomes aware of. Most French learners can recall the day that a classmate first uttered the phrase \u2018Je suis excit\u00e9\u2019 (which literally translates as \u2018I am excited\u2019) only to have their teacher hem and haw uncomfortably before explaining that the word excit\u00e9 doesn\u2019t signal emotional but rather physical excitement. A better translation of the phrase Je suis excit\u00e9 into English would be \u2018I am aroused\u2019.\n\nFrench doesn\u2019t have the excited/aroused lexical pair that English does, so one word does both jobs. Excit\u00e9 technically denotes excitement both \u201cobjective (a state of stimulation) and subjective (feelings),\u201d according to Olivier Frayss\u00e9, professor of American Civilization at Paris-Sorbonne University, but the physical sensation is the one most often implied. \u201cIf \u2018aroused\u2019 existed, it would be unnecessary to interpret \u2018excit\u00e9\u2019 this way,\u201d he explained.\n\nOur cooler, calmer, more reticent sides come out when we're speaking French\n\nAnglophones, meanwhile, blessed with both words, are free to use \u2018excited\u2019 as we please \u2013 which we (particularly Americans) do with reckless abandon. We\u2019re excited for our weekend plans, for the summer holiday, to get home after a long day of work and relax in front of our favourite Netflix show. But English speakers who live in France have no way to express this sentiment in the language of our adopted country. As opposed to other false friends \u2013 like \u2018Je suis pleine\u2019, which means not \u2018I\u2019m full\u2019, as its literal translation suggests, but \u2018I\u2019m pregnant\u2019, forcing Francophones to use phrases like \u2018J\u2019ai assez mang\u00e9\u2019 (\u2018I\u2019ve eaten enough\u2019) or \u2018je suis repu\u2019 (\u2018I am sated\u2019) \u2013 not only is \u2018Je suis excit\u00e9\u2019 not the appropriate way to convey excitement, but there seems to be no real way to express it at all.\n\n\u201cI usually say \u2018Je suis heureuse\u2019 [\u2018I\u2019m happy\u2019] or \u2018J\u2019ai h\u00e2te de\u2019 [\u2018I\u2019m looking forward to\u2019],\u201d one bilingual friend said. Neither quite captures the intensity of excitement, but it seems these are the best substitutes that French has to offer.\n\n\u201cI think it's safe to say I express excitement often and outwardly,\u201d said bilingual Australian Dr Gemma King, who teaches French language and cinema at the Australian National University in Canberra, noting that when she speaks French, it is another story entirely. \u201cMy students and I often joke that our cooler, calmer, more reticent sides come out when we're speaking French,\u201d she said.\n\nThis is not, then, a mere question of translation, but rather a question of culture. Like other untranslatable terms like Japan\u2019s shinrin-yoku (the relaxation gained from being around nature) or dadirri (deep, reflective listening) in aboriginal Australian, it seems as though the average French person doesn\u2019t need to express excitement on the day to day.\n\nFor Julie Barlow, Canadian co-author of The Story of French and The Bonjour Effect, this is largely due to the implied enthusiasm in the word \u2018excited\u2019, something that\u2019s not sought after in French culture. She notes that Francophone Canadians, culturally North American rather than French, find work-arounds such as \u2018\u00c7a m\u2019enthousiasme\u2019 (\u2018It enthuses me\u2019).\n\n\u201c[The French] don't appreciate in conversation a kind of positive, sunny exuberance that's really typical of Americans and that we really value,\u201d Barlow explained. \u201cVerbally, \u2018I'm so excited\u2019 is sort of a smile in words. French people prefer to come across as kind of negative, by reflex.\n\nMy French husband agrees.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re too happy in French, we\u2019re kind of wondering what\u2019s wrong with you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in English, that\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nFor some, however, it\u2019s not necessarily negativity that the French seek, but reserve.\n\n\u201cI think there is something cultural about the greater level of reservation French people tend to show in everyday conversation,\u201d Dr King said. \u201cFrom my perspective, it doesn't mean they show less enthusiasm, but perhaps less of an emotional investment in things they are enthusiastic about.\u201d\n\nIndeed, those who are unable to show the proper emotional detachment within French society can even be perceived as being somehow deranged, something that is exemplified by the pejorative labelling of former President Nicolas Sarkozy as \u2018l\u2019excit\u00e9\u2019, due to the zeal he shows in public appearances.\n\nAmerican Matt Jenner lived in France for several years and is bilingual. For him, it is not necessarily a matter of the French not being able to express their excitement, but rather that English speakers \u2013 and Americans in particular \u2013 tend to go overboard. The American public, he says, has been trained \u201cto have a fake, almost cartoonish view on life, in which superficial excitement and false happiness are the norm.\u201d By comparison, he notes, in France, \u201cexcitement is typically shown only when it is truly meant.\u201d\n\nAuthenticity has been important to the French since the Revolution, according to Brice Couturier at France Culture. \u201cThe Ancien R\u00e9gime, indeed, had cultivated a culture of the court and of salons, based on the art of appearances and pleasing,\u201d he said. \u201cThis culture implied a great mastery of the behavioural codes of the time, as well as an ability to conceal one\u2019s true emotions.\u201d\n\nExcitement is typically shown only when it is truly meant\n\nIn reaction, Couturier continued, the French revolutionaries fought back against these masks and this hypocrisy \u2013 something that the French maintain today by expressing their emotions as truthfully as possible to avoid appearing inauthentic.\n\nThis tendency was something that irked me when I first noticed it: French friends saying that a dish they tried in a restaurant was just \u2018fine\u2019, or shrugging nonchalantly when I asked if they were looking forward to their holiday. Their attitude struck me as unnecessarily negative. But on our first joint visit to the US, my husband opened my eyes to the somewhat forced hyperbole of American excitement. After our server cheerfully greeted us at a restaurant, he asked if she was a friend of mine; he could think of no other reason why her welcome would be so enthusiastic.\n\n\u201cI used to judge Americans because I thought they were always too ecstatic, always having disproportionate reactions,\u201d he told me years later, though now, he added, \u201cI feel like I have two worlds in my head, one in French and one in English. I feel like the English world is a lot more fun than the French one.\u201d\n\nAfter 11 years of living in France, my innate desire to say \u201cJe suis excit\u00e9e\u201d has faded. But I still fixate on the idea that the French live in the \u00eatre.\n\nWhen we were first dating, my husband used to watch me buzzing around like a busy bee, making plans for the future. He, meanwhile, was able to find not excitement, but contentment, in nearly everything. His frequent motto, whether we were drinking ros\u00e9 in the sunshine or just sitting in a park, was: \u201con est bien, l\u00e0\u201d \u2013 we are good, here.\n\nExcitement, after all, has a forward-thinking connotation, a necessary suggestion of the future. Ubiquitous in Anglophone culture, where we are often thinking about imminent or far-off plans, about goals and dreams, this is far less present among French people who, on the contrary, tend to live more in the moment. It\u2019s not necessarily that they don\u2019t think of the future but that they don\u2019t fixate on the future. They consider it, cerebrally, but their emotions are in the present.\n\n\u201cLife in France places you happily in the present tense,\u201d Paris-based author Matthew Fraser told The Local, \u201cunlike in Anglo-Protestant countries where everything is driving madly towards the future.\u201d\n\nLife in France places you happily in the present tense\n\nThe excitement that drives Anglophones to action, motivating us and driving us to look ahead is not nearly as present in France. But joie de vivre and contentment in simple pleasures certainly are. And when one is living in the moment, there\u2019s no need to think about \u2013 or get excited about \u2013 what\u2019s next.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

    "text": "Why are there no chairs in the Bible, or in all 30,000 lines of Homer? Neither are there any in the play Hamlet \u2013 written in 1599. But by the middle of the 19th Century, it is a completely different story. In Charles Dickens\u2019s Bleak House, suddenly there are 187 mentions of them. What changed?\n\nWith sitting sometimes being described as \u2018the new smoking\u2019, we know that spending too much time in chairs is bad for us. Not only are chairs unhealthy, but like air pollution, they are becoming almost impossible for modern humans to avoid.\n\nWhen I started researching my book about how the world we have created around us is changing our bodies, I was surprised to discover just how rare chairs used to be. Now they\u2019re everywhere \u2013 in offices, trains, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, pubs, cars, concert halls, cinemas, doctor\u2019s surgeries, hospitals, theatres, schools, lecture halls, and all over our houses (I guarantee you have more than you think).\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 Should we really all fly less?\n\n\u2022 The shocking new cure for extreme pain\n\n\u2022 Why happy music makes you do bad things\n\nIf I was asked to make even a conservative estimate of the number of chairs in the world, I\u2019d find it hard to go lower than eight to 10 per person. Applying that logic, there could be more than 60 billion of them on the planet. Surely chairs should be one of the universal signals that mark the arrival of our current geological epoch, the Anthropocene? Like other markers of our shift to a new time period, chairs are to be found on every continent.\n\nAs to why there are suddenly so many chairs, there is no single clear reason. It is a confluence of fashion, politics, changing work habits, and the lust for comfort. The last of these requires no explanation in a culture where ease and comfort are among the strongest drivers of consumer decision-making.\n\nWhile chairs began to appear with a little more frequency in the early modern period (1500-1800), it seems that they became much more popular during the Industrial Revolution.\n\nBefore the 18th Century, a chair was relatively easily come by, but the majority of the population had little use for them. Even today, it is not easy to sit on a hard wooden chair for sustained periods and upholstered chairs were prohibitively expensive. But the fashion for a new reclining culture, which spread from the French court of the 18th Century, helped to popularise their early use.\n\nFor centuries before, chairs had persistently been associated with power, wealth and high status\n\nFor centuries before, chairs had persistently been associated with power, wealth and high status. They were about as widely used by the peasantry as a crown. There is an instructive stage direction in the First Folio of King Lear in which the monarch enters while being carried by servants \u201cin a chair\u201d. The idea of chairs as a symbol of status still persists today. The highest attainment in my own profession, academia, is called \u2018a chair\u2019. The individual that runs a meeting is called \u2018a chair\u2019. The head of a company is also a chairman or woman. And it is a truth, universally acknowledged, that the best chair in any office building always belongs to the boss.\n\nOnce the use of chairs was democratised (particularly after the French Revolution in France and the 1832 Great Reform Acts in the UK), this coincided with a slow change in our working patterns. The majority of work done in the Victorian period would have been understood as manual labour or factory work.\n\nBut towards the end of the 19th Century, as the second wave of a technological revolution gathered pace with inventions such as the typewriter, telegraphy and the expanding uses of electricity, the labour market also began to change. The new category of office clerks was the fastest-growing occupational group in the latter half of the period. In 1851, the census suggests that fewer than 44,000 people were performing administrative work. In just two decades, sedentary workers had more than doubled to 91,000.\n\nToday, sedentary workers are in the majority. And, throughout the 20th Century, a forest of other sedentary activities have sprouted around us to match our new working lives.\n\nNovel reading increased hugely in popularity throughout the 19th Century \u2013 and further sedentary leisure activities followed with the arrival of cinema, radio and television. More recently, computer gaming, media streaming and other screen-time activities lead us to sit still in contemplation. The Anthropocene human needs chairs to fulfil all of these \u2018activities\u2019.\n\nResearch conducted by the British Heart Foundation suggests that we enjoy about 9.5 hours per day of sedentary time\n\nIf modern life presents us with a bouquet of sedentary behaviours, then chairs are the stalks. They are so necessary to leading a modern life that most of what we do seems unimaginable without them. Research conducted by the British Heart Foundation suggests that we enjoy about 9.5 hours per day of sedentary time. This means that modern humans are inactive for about 75% of their time. There are a few problems with this.\n\nThe health of our hard and soft tissues can be boiled down to the adage \u2018use it or lose it\u2019. Muscle and bone respond either to increased load or the cessation of use. Bones become denser or thinner while muscles get stronger or weaker. Seated so much, with most of the musculature in our backs disengaged as they recline in a chair, it is little wonder that with our weakened spines, back pain is now the number one cause of disability, globally.\n\nJust as we have an Anthropocene environment, we might equally class ourselves as Anthropocene humans. Palaeolithic humans died most frequently in infancy. Violence and injury were also common causes of mortality in later life. Modern humans, though, overwhelmingly die as a result of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease and some cancers \u2013 all strongly linked with inactivity: namely, chair use.\n\nA 2012 study investigating the effects of inactivity collated behavioural data from 7,813 women and found that those that sat for ten hours a day had shorter telomeres (an indicator of cellular ageing). Their sedentary habits had aged them biologically by about eight years. Some studies even suggest that the effects of sitting for sustained periods cannot be offset by a little exercise.\n\nThese studies and many others attest to the fact that we should be thinking carefully about investing any further in our relatively new-found and passionate love affair with the chair.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Conversation, and is republished under a Creative Commons licence.\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\n\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Populations of brown bears have increased in many parts of Europe\n\nThe EU is to allow farmers to receive full compensation for any damages caused by attacks from protected animals like lynxes, wolves and bears.\n\nOther expenses including installing electric fences or acquiring guard dogs to prevent damage will also be fully reimbursed.\n\nThe EU says the move will help protect large predators in areas where they have come into conflict with humans.\n\nCampaigners hope it will limit the need for culls.\n\nAfter many decades of decline, the numbers of large carnivores like wolves and bears are stable or increasing in many parts of Europe, often due to concentrated conservation efforts.\n\nThere are now around 17,000 brown bears in Europe, spread over 22 countries. While they remain threatened they have done well in places such as Cantabria in northern Spain where their numbers have almost doubled in ten years.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Wolf sightings have increased in Germany and France in recent years\n\nBut conservation success is also increasing the chances of human-wildlife conflict.\n\nWolf numbers have increased in Germany to such an extent that the animals now roam into the Netherlands where they have been linked to an increase in attacks on sheep.\n\nDespite these wild carnivores being protected by law in most countries, that hasn't stopped farmers reaching for their guns when their domestic animals have been attacked.\n\nThis has become a significant issue in some countries. In France, around 10,000 sheep were killed in wolf attacks in 2016, with the government paying out some \u20ac3.2m in compensation.\n\nNow the EU hopes that by relaxing the rules on reimbursing farmers for the damage done by carnivores, it will lessen the need for farmers to kill these threatened species.\n\nUnder the new arrangement, member states will be able to fully compensate farmers for damages caused by wolves and bears. The farmers will also be entitled to compensation for building electric fences and buying guard dogs.\n\nIndirect expenses, including veterinary bills for the treatment of wounded sheep or cattle, and the costs of searching for missing animals, will also be fully met.\n\nAnimal rights campaigners welcomed the move.\n\n\"It's taking away an excuse for killing the animals by saying there are preventative measures you can take which can reduce, if not completely eliminate the threat,\" said Dr Jo Swabe from Humane Society International.\n\n\"We hope it will make a difference on the ground.\"\n\nImage copyright NurPhoto Image caption French farmers have held protests against plans to allow wolf numbers to increase\n\nThere has been a lot of pressure from governments in Germany and France to allow culls of wolves as a way of protecting domestic livestock. And some have raised concerns that humans could also be attacked.\n\n\"You have essentially scaremongering politicians saying we need to have this option because sometimes it could be a child that's attacked,\" said Dr Swabe.\n\n\"But if you look at wolf behaviour, it's highly unlikely that a child would ever be attacked. They have more to fear from us than we have from them.\"\n\nWhile the EU has sanctioned increased payments for farmers in the hope that this might reduce the need for culling, the money has not always been forthcoming from governments. Experts say that in Romania, for example, payments for damage caused by large carnivore attacks have been withheld.\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Are you guilty of poor cyber-security habits?\n\nHumans are often the weakest link in the chain when it comes to computer security. So how can we stop doing silly things that play into the hands of cyber criminals?\n\nWhen you ring IT support, you know the geek on the other end of the line thinks you're an idiot. It's the heavy sigh and patronising tone that give it away.\n\nIn fact, they have an acronym for us - PEBKAC. It stands for Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair. That's you and me.\n\nAnd before you get on your high horse full of indignation, ask yourself: when did I last back up my data? How many online accounts do I use the same password for? How many times have I clicked on a link in an email without really knowing who sent it?\n\nEvery year we're reminded how dumb we are when it comes to choosing passwords.\n\nThese range from the obviously bad \"123456\" and \"password\", to the only marginally improved \"12345678\" and \"admin\".\n\nOther popular ones, according to a list drawn up from those found in breaches, are \"letmein\", \"iloveyou\", \"welcome\" and \"monkey\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Admit it, you've often written down your password in a place anyone could see it, haven't you?\n\nWith passwords like these, a child of two could probably break in to your account after bashing on the keyboard with a toy hammer for a few hours.\n\nThe fact is we're lazy.\n\n\"A lot of people forget their password and then just use the temporary password the IT department gave them,\" says Thomas Pedersen from OneLogin, an identity and access management company.\n\n\"The problem is that these temporary passwords can sometimes last a month.\"\n\nSo in a large organisation, there are potentially hundreds of people using the same password.\n\n\"This makes them vulnerable to a password scrape attack - taking the most common passwords and trying them on millions of accounts,\" says Mr Pedersen.\n\n\"The hackers will get a hit every 5,000 to 6,000 times.\"\n\nOnce inside the system, the hackers can cause havoc.\n\nHow not to be a password poodle\n\nUse as long a password as you can cope with - at least more than eight characters\n\nMix upper case and lower case characters with symbols and numbers\n\nTry not to use easily guessable words - the names of your children, spouse, pets, favourite sports teams and so on\n\nAvoid sharing passwords with other people\n\nUse different passwords for different sites and services\n\nUse two-factor authentication\n\nConsider using a password manager such as Dashlane, Sticky Password or Roboform\n\nThe UK's National Cyber Security Centre has also published lots of advice about choosing and using good passwords\n\nMajor data breaches are becoming almost weekly occurrences, with Facebook, Cathay Pacific, British Airways, Reddit, Wonga, and Dixons Carphone joining a long list of corporate victims in recent months.\n\nTwo-factor authentication - using your smartphone or a separate dongle to provide an extra layer of security on top of your main log-in details - is becoming more common, especially using biometrics such as voice, fingerprint, and facial recognition.\n\nBut these are less suited to the corporate environment because desktops don't usually come with fingerprint readers or video cameras built in, Mr Pedersen points out.\n\nWe're also pretty dumb when it comes to clicking on links and downloading content we shouldn't, says Ian Pratt, co-founder of cyber-security firm Bromium.\n\nA lot of these links are loaded with malware - programs designed to burrow though corporate security systems, steal data or even take remote control of machines.\n\n\"More than 99% of [malicious links] are run-of-the-mill criminal malware that are not targeted,\" he says. \"That malware is trying to spread pretty aggressively, but they do not use any clever tricks.\"\n\nThe simple stuff works.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Many cyber-attacks were successful because we clicked on something we shouldn't have\n\n\"More than 70% of the breaches that we hear about have started on a PC with some hapless user clicking on something that lets attackers get on to the network,\" says Mr Pratt.\n\nAnd hard-pressed IT departments have had their lives made even more difficult in recent years by the surge in mobile phones, laptops and tablets we use for work as well as for private purposes.\n\nSo, many large firms are focusing on making the desktop PC idiot-proof.\n\nBromium's tech works by isolating each and every action that takes place on a PC - sandboxing to use the jargon.\n\n\"Almost every task performed effectively gets its own computer,\" explains Mr Pratt. \"As soon as you finish that task we effectively throw that laptop away and get out a new one.\"\n\nThis means that if you click on a malicious link, the malware is isolated and can't escape to infect the rest of the network.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Would face recognition and other biometrics improve security in the workplace?\n\nBut keeping an eye on what we're doing across a sprawling IT network is very hard, says Paul Farrington, a former chief technology officer for Barclays and now a consultant at security firm Veracode.\n\nLarge organisations being clueless about the extent and reach of their IT assets is \"very common\", he says.\n\nA project Veracode carried out for one high street bank discovered 1,800 websites the organisation had not logged.\n\n\"Their perimeter can be 50% larger than they originally thought it was,\" says Mr Farrington.\n\nAnd this ignorance can also extend to the number of computers - or \"endpoints\", in the jargon - sitting on a corporate network, says Nathan Dornbrook, founder and head of security firm ECS.\n\nOne of his clients has more than 400,000 machines to manage, and several other customers have similar numbers.\n\n\"The machines could contain substantial amounts of information and customer data, passwords to internal systems, and all sorts of bits and pieces in the easy single sign-on applications that cache credentials locally,\" he says.\n\nIn other words, just one of these PCs could be an Aladdin's cave to a hacker.\n\n\"If one attack gets inside,\" says Mr Dornbrook, \"you lose the whole enterprise.\"\n\nMore Technology of Business\n\nSo given that we're PEBKACs and IT departments are overloaded, automated systems are becoming increasingly necessary, cyber-security experts say.\n\nFor example, ECS uses the Tachyon tool from security firm 1E to help monitor millions of PCs and keep them updated with the latest software patches and security updates.\n\n\"Otherwise you just don't have time to react,\" says Mr Dornbrook.\n\nMany other cyber-security companies are moving from a firewall approach to automated real-time traffic monitoring, looking for strange behaviour on the network.\n\nBut it would certainly help if we all didn't behave like PEBKACs at work and casually give away the keys to the kingdom."

However, both have health problems of their own and cannot breed naturally.\n\nThe southern white rhino is found in southern Africa, including South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.\n\nNumbers dropped to a few hundred individuals around a century ago, but conservation efforts led to a recovery. About 20,000 exist in protected areas and private game reserves.\n\nWhat would it take to save the northern white rhino?\n\nThe survival of the northern white rhino looks bleak, and relies on last-ditch hotly-debated conservation efforts, which involve IVF and cloning.\n\nA priceless store of frozen sperm from male northern white rhinos still exists, but conservationists are divided about how it should be used.\n\nIn July, one team took eggs from female southern rhinos - which number around 20,000 in the wild - and fertilised them with frozen sperm from a male northern white rhino, to create hybrid embryos.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Southern white rhino at Londolozi Reserve in South Africa\n\nThe new study suggests this sort of approach might pay off, given that the two rhinos are closer genetically than once thought.\n\n\"We think it improves the chances,\" said Prof Bruford. \"It is difficult to predict what might happen if we cross the two subspecies but given the current options for the northern white rhino it becomes a more viable option, should other approaches fail.\"\n\nOther options include using frozen tissue from a wider pool of northern white rhinos to generate stem cells that have the capacity to develop into eggs and sperm.\n\nThis would avoid diluting the gene pool, but is more challenging to achieve.\n\nThe research, by scientists in the UK, South Africa, Czech Republic, Austria, Germany and the US, is published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B.\n\nFollow Helen on Twitter."

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nSome 250 big organisations have now pledged to eradicate plastic waste by 2025, including Coca Cola, H&M and L'Oreal, up from 40 in April.\n\nAll promised that 100% of their plastic packaging would be reused, recycled or composted within seven years.\n\nThe aim is to combat plastic waste pollution, which is harming the seas.\n\nThe Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which is behind the campaign, said if current trends continue, there could be more plastic than fish in the seas by 2050.\n\nThe foundation was launched in 2010 by the record-breaking yachtswoman to improve environmental standards, particularly on plastic use, after she was shocked by the level of plastic pollution she observed on her round the world sailings.\n\nAn estimated 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic had been produced since the early 1950s, with 60% of it ending up in landfills or the natural environment.\n\nAnd while packaging, such as bottles, yoghurt pots and wrappers, is not the sole source of plastic pollution, it represents the biggest use of plastic.\n\nThe move was welcomed by environmental campaigners, Friends of the Earth.\n\nFriends of the Earth plastics campaigner Julian Kirby said: \"It's encouraging that more firms and governments are listening to public demands to curb plastic waste and are pledging to act. A global movement on this issue is urgently needed.\"\n\nAccording to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, signatories to the pledge - which include big firms like Burberry and Mars, as well as governments and NGOs - have made commitments to:\n\nEliminate \"problematic or unnecessary\" plastic packaging and move from single-use to reusable packaging by 2025\n\nEnsure all plastic packaging can be \"easily and safely\" recycled or composted\n\nIncrease the amounts of plastics reused or recycled into new packaging or products.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Pyramid-shaped PG Tips teabags are now made from biodegradable material\n\nOne signatory, Marmite-maker Unilever, told the BBC it recycles about two thirds of the plastic it produces but has been cutting plastic waste for some time.\n\nIn February, stopped sealing its pyramid-shaped PG Tips teabags with polypropylene, using corn starch instead.\n\n'Circular approach'\n\nIt is also looking at ways of reusing black Tresemme shampoo bottles and getting recycled plastic into Hellmann's mayonnaise bottles.\n\nCurrently Hellmann's bottles can be recycled but contain no recycled plastic.\n\n\"The aim is to move towards a circular approach, where you are only using recycled content and you work toward eliminating single-use packaging,\" Mr Blanchard told the BBC.\n\n\"We are seeing consumers wanting fully recyclable solutions. In the next few years people who use our products will be looking for packs that are recyclable or use recycled content, and we will be telling them on the packaging when that's the case.\"\n\nDame Ellen MacArthur, founder of the MacArthur Foundation, said the pledge offered a \"clear vision for what we need to create a circular economy for plastic\".\n\nSignatories have agreed to publish annual data on their progress, with targets become \"increasingly ambitious\" over the coming years."

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nA \"meat tax\" could prevent almost 6,000 deaths per year in the UK, according to researchers, but should politicians be telling people what they can and can't eat?\n\nScientists at the University of Oxford say governments should consider imposing price hikes on red meat - such as beef, lamb and pork - to reduce consumption.\n\nThey say it would save lives and more than \u00a3700m in UK healthcare costs, according to new research.\n\nSo why can red meat be harmful?\n\nVarious research has linked eating red meat to an increased risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes.\n\nIn 2015 the World Health Organization warned that processed meats, like bacon, sausages and ham, could cause cancer, while unprocessed red meat could also increase your risk.\n\nAnd eating lots of red meat doesn't just have an impact on your own health.\n\nResearchers at the University of Oxford said meat eaters were also increasing the burden on the health service and the economy, due to a loss of workforce from ill health.\n\nThere is also a growing awareness of the environmental impact of eating red meat.\n\nThe high levels of land and water use and carbon emissions associated with its production mean cutting down is one of the key ways individuals can help tackle climate change.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dr Marco Springmann tells Today eating only one portion of red meat a week could help tackle global warming\n\nHow could a tax work? And what would it do to prices?\n\nResearchers say a meat tax could cut consumption of processed meat by about two portions per week in high-income countries.\n\nIn the UK, the study suggests a tax of 14% on red meat and 79% on processed meat.\n\nThis would mean the price of a 227g Tesco Sirloin Steak would increase from \u00a33.80 to \u00a34.33.\n\nAnd for a pack of eight pork sausages from Sainsbury's the price would increase from \u00a31.50 to \u00a32.69.\n\nHas there been anything like this before?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sugar tax: Drinks becoming pricier and in smaller bottles\n\nEarlier this year the government introduced a sugar tax on soft drinks, meaning manufacturers have to pay a levy on high-sugar drinks.\n\nThe tax has already had an effect, with some leading brands reducing the sugar content in their products to avoid the levy.\n\nBut whether it means consumers buy fewer sugary drinks remains to be seen.\n\nThe impact of charging 5p for single-use carrier bags suggests financial incentives can change behaviour.\n\nThe number of plastic bags handed out by supermarkets in England has drastically decreased since the change was introduced.\n\nHowever the government has been less keen on the idea of a \"latte levy\" on disposable coffee cups.\n\nMinisters prefer the idea of shops offering discounts to customers bringing their own cups rather than an extra charge.\n\nWhat are the arguments against?\n\nAttempts by the government to tell people what to do don't always go down well.\n\nChristopher Snowdon from the Institute for Economic Affairs, a free market think tank, said taxing food was \"the next battleground for the nanny state\".\n\nLast month climate minister Claire Perry told BBC News it was not the government's place to tell people they can't eat steak and chips, despite the environmental impact.\n\nMr Snowdon also argued it would be \"absurd\" to raise the cost of living through a meat tax.\n\nThere's also the concern that it targets foods bought by those on lower incomes.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @innov8tor3 Those advocating a meat and processed meat tax have not considered where the greatest impact would be. Those around the poverty line would likely be pushed further into poverty as a result.#PreventPoverty@GarethThomasMP \u2014 Peter Jones (@innov8tor3) November 7, 2018 Report\n\nAnd then there is the question of whether it would work.\n\nThe cost of a fry-up would be more expensive, but would this actually discourage meat-lovers from buying their favourite foods?"

    "authors": [
      "Diego Arguedas Ortiz"
    ],
    "text": "In a new report published in September 2018, the world\u2019s leading climate scientists made their starkest warning so far: our current actions are not enough for us to meet our target of 1.5C of warming. We need to do more.\n\nIt\u2019s settled science that climate change is real, and we\u2019re starting to see some of the ways that it affects us. It increases the likelihood of flooding in Miami and elsewhere, threatens the millions of people living along the Brahmaputra River in north-eastern India and disrupts the sex life of plants and animals.\n\nSo we don\u2019t need to ask whether climate change is happening \u2013 or whether humans are causing it. Instead, we need to ask: \u201cwhat can we do?\u201d\n\nWhat can you do that will have the biggest impact? Here\u2019s our guide.\n\n1. What is the single most important thing humanity has to do in the coming years \u2013 and what does that mean for me?\n\nThe number one goal? Limiting the use of fossil fuels such as oil, carbon and natural gas and replacing them with renewable and cleaner sources of energy, all while increasing energy efficiency. \u201cWe need to cut CO2 emissions almost in half (45%) by the end of the next decade,\u201d says Kimberly Nicholas, associate professor of sustainability science at the Lund University Centre for Sustainability Studies (LUCSUS), in Sweden.\n\nThe road towards that transition includes daily decisions within your reach \u2013 like driving and flying less, switching to a \u2018green\u2019 energy provider and changing what you eat and buy.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s true that climate change won\u2019t be solved by your buying or driving habits alone \u2013 although many experts agree these are important, and can influence others to make changes too (more on that later). Other changes are needed that can only be made on a bigger, system-wide basis \u2013 like revamping our subsidy system for the energy and food industries, which continue to reward fossil fuels, or setting new rules and incentives for sectors like farming, deforestation and waste management.\n\nOne good example of the importance of this regards refrigerants. An advocacy group of researchers, business-people and NGOs called Drawdown found that getting rid of HFCs (chemicals used in fridges and air conditioning) was the number-one most effective policy to reduce emissions. That\u2019s because they are up to 9,000 more warming for the atmosphere than CO2. The good news is that we have made global progress on this, and two years ago 170 countries agreed to start phasing out HFCs in 2019.\n\nThis is important because we need \u201cunprecedented changes in all aspects of society to deal with climate change, says the IPCC report. \u201cEveryone is going to have to be involved,\" says Debra Robert, co-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the group tasked with the report.\n\n2. Changing how industries are run or subsidised doesn\u2019t sound like anything I can influence... can I?\n\nYou can. Individuals need to exercise their rights both as citizens and as consumers, Robert and other experts say, putting pressure on their governments and on companies to make the system-wide changes that are needed.\n\nAnother way, increasingly undertaken by universities, faith groups and recently even at a countrywide level, is to \u2018divest\u2019 funds out of polluting activities \u2013 such as avoiding stocks in fossil fuels, or banks that invest in high-emission industries. By getting rid of financial instruments related to the fossil fuel industry, organisations can both take climate action and reap economic benefits.\n\n3. Other than that, what\u2019s the best daily action I can take?\n\nOne 2017 study co-authored by Lund University\u2019s Nicholas ranked 148 individual actions on climate change according to their impact. Going car-free was the number-one most effective action an individual could take (except not having kids \u2013 but more on that on that later). Cars are more polluting compared to other means of transportation like walking, biking or using public transport.\n\nIn industrialised countries such as European nations, getting rid of your car can reduce 2.5 tonnes of CO2 \u2013 about one-fourth of the average yearly emissions (9.2 tonnes) contributed by each person in developed countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\n\u201cWe should choose more efficient vehicles and, whenever possible, switch directly to electric vehicles,\u201d says Maria Virginia Vilarino, co-author of the mitigation chapter in the IPCC\u2019s latest report.\n\n4. But isn\u2019t renewable energy extremely expensive?\n\nActually, renewables like wind and solar are becoming increasingly cheap across the world (although final costs are subject to local circumstances). The latest report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) found that several of the most commonly used renewables, like solar, geothermal, bioenergy, hydropower and onshore wind, will be on par with or cheaper than fossil fuels by 2020. Some are already more cost-effective.\n\nThe cost of utility-scale solar panels has fallen 73% since 2010, for example, making solar energy the cheapest source of electricity for many households in Latin America, Asia and Africa. In the UK, onshore wind and solar are competitive with gas and by 2025 will be the cheapest source of electricity generation.\n\nSome critics argue that these prices disregard the price of integrating renewables on the electricity system \u2013 but recent evidence suggests these costs are \u2018modest\u2019 and manageable for the grid.\n\n5. Could I make a difference by changing my diet?\n\nThat\u2019s a big one, too. In fact, after fossil fuels, the food industry \u2013 and in particular the meat and dairy sector \u2013 is one of the most important contributors to climate change. If cattle were their own nation, they would be the world\u2019s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China and the US.\n\nThe meat industry contributes to global warming in three major ways. Firstly, cows\u2019 burping from processing food releases lots of methane, a greenhouse gas. Secondly, we feed them with other potential sources of food, like maize and soy, which makes for a very inefficient process. And finally, they also require lots of water, fertilisers that can release greenhouse gases, and plenty of land \u2013 some of which come from cleared forests, another source of carbon emissions.\n\nBy reducing your consumption of animal protein by half, you can cut your diet's carbon footprint by more than 40%\n\nYou don\u2019t have to go vegetarian or vegan to make a difference: cut down gradually and become a \u2018flexitarian\u2019. By reducing your consumption of animal protein by half, you can cut your diet's carbon footprint by more than 40%. A larger-scale approach could be something like banning meat across an organisation, as office-sharing company WeWork did in 2018.\n\nThis explainer of sustainable diets by the World Resources Institute (WIR) and its longer associated report provides more answers to questions about food and carbon emissions.\n\n6. How harmful are my flying habits?\n\nPlanes run on fossil fuels, and we haven\u2019t figured out a scaleable alternative. Although some early efforts to use solar panels to fly around the world have had success, we are still decades away from commercial flights running on solar energy.\n\nA normal transatlantic round-trip flight can release around 1.6 tonnes of CO2 \u2013 almost as much as the average yearly emissions of one person in India.\n\nA normal transatlantic round-trip flight can release around 1.6 tonnes of CO2, according to Nicholas\u2019s study \u2013 almost as much as the average yearly emissions of one person in India. This also highlights the inequality of climate change: while everyone will be affected, only a minority of humans fly and even fewer people take planes often.\n\nThere are groups of scientists and members of the public who have decided to give up flying or who fly less. Virtual meetings, holidaying in local destinations or using trains instead of planes all are ways to cut down.\n\nWondering how much your travel contributes to climate change? Measure your carbon emissions in this calculator by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n7. Should I be shopping differently?\n\nMost likely. That\u2019s because everything we buy has a carbon footprint, either in the way it is produced or in how it is transported.\n\nFor instance, the clothing sector represents around 3% of the world\u2019s global production emissions of CO2, mostly because of the use of energy to produce attire. The hectic pace of fast fashion contributes to this figure as clothes are discarded or fall apart after short periods.\n\nInternational transport, including maritime and air shipping, also has an impact. Groceries shipped from Chile and Australia to Europe, or the other way around, have more \u2018food miles\u2019 and usually a higher footprint than local produce. But this is not always the case, as some countries grow out-of-season crops in energy-intensive greenhouses \u2013 so the best approach is to eat food that is both locally grown and seasonal. Even so, eating vegetarian still beats only purchasing local.\n\n8. Should I think about how many children I have (or don\u2019t have)?\n\nNicholas\u2019s study concluded that having fewer children is the best way to reduce your contribution to climate change, with almost 60 tonnes of CO2 avoided per year. But this result has been contentious \u2013 and it leads to other questions.\n\nOne is whether you are responsible for children\u2019s climate emissions, and the other is where are these babies born.\n\nIf you are responsible for your kids\u2019 emissions, are your parents responsible for yours? And if you are not, how should we consider the fact that more people will likely have more carbon emissions? We also could ask whether having offspring is a human right beyond questioning. And we could ask if having children is necessarily a bad thing for solving climate change: our challenges may mean we will need more problem-solvers in future generations, not fewer.\n\nThose are hard, philosophical questions \u2013 and we\u2019re not going to try to answer them here.\n\nWhat we do know is that no two people have the same emissions. Although the average human releases around 5 tonnes of CO2 per year, each country has very different circumstances: developed nations like the US and South Korea have higher national averages (16.5 tonnes and 11.5 tonnes per person, respectively) than developing countries like Pakistan and Philippines (around 1 tonne each). Even within national borders, richer people have higher emissions than people with less access to goods and services. So if you choose to take this question into account, you have to remember that it\u2019s not just about how many children you have \u2013 it\u2019s where (and who) you are.\n\n9. But if I eat less meat or take fewer flights, that\u2019s just me \u2013 how much of a difference can that really make?\n\nActually, it\u2019s not just you. Social scientists have found that when one person makes a sustainability-oriented decision, other people do too.\n\nHere are four examples:\n\nSocial scientists believe this occurs because we constantly evaluate what our peers are doing and we adjust our beliefs and actions accordingly. When people see their neighbours taking environmental action, like conserving energy, they infer that people like them also value sustainability and feel more compelled to act.\n\n10. What if I just can\u2019t avoid that flight, or cut down on driving?\n\nIf you simply can\u2019t make every change that\u2019s needed, consider offsetting your emissions with a trusted green project \u2013 not a \u2018get out of jail free card\u2019, but another resource in your toolbox to compensate that unavoidable flight or car trip. The UN Climate Convention keeps a portfolio of dozens of projects around the world you can contribute to. To find out how many emissions you need to \u2018buy\u2019 back, you can use its handy carbon footprint calculator.\n\nWhether you are a coffee farmer in Colombia or a homeowner in California, climate change will have an impact on your life. But the opposite is also true: your actions will influence the planet for the coming decades \u2013 for better or for worse.\n\n--\n\nDiego Arguedas Ortiz is a science and climate change reporter for BBC Future.

    "title": "How antibiotic resistance could take us back to the 'dark ages'",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nScientists are working on a new antibiotic that has produced promising results in early trials. Medicine will need more of these in coming years if increasing bacterial resistance is not to pose a very serious threat to human health.\n\nWhen they were introduced, in the 1940s, antibiotics were hailed as a \"wonder drug\". But there are major concerns that over-prescription has led to increasing resistance to the drugs.\n\nLast week, the Chief Medical Officer for England, Prof Dame Sally Davies, went as far as to say we were \"at risk of putting medicine back in the dark ages\" - but why has this happened?\n\nWhat are antibiotics?\n\nScottish chemist Alexander Fleming discovered the first true antibiotic, penicillin, in 1928, as a mould on a petri dish that inhibited the growth of bacteria. His discovery revolutionised the treatment of certain types of bacterial infection, saving countless lives in the process.\n\nAntibiotics fight bacteria in a number of ways, including by killing them or preventing them from spreading.\n\nHowever, they also have a major weakness.\n\nResistance\n\nAntibiotics are very effective at killing most, but not all, bacteria. Some bacteria acquire genes that protect them from the drug's attack.\n\nThey survive treatment and reproduce themselves, spreading the key genes more widely so the drug becomes ever less effective.\n\nIf somebody is infected by these drug-resistant bacteria, then it can become harder to deploy antibiotics to treat them successfully.\n\nAt present other types of antibiotic might do the trick but the options are starting to narrow as bacteria develop the ability to block more than one drug.\n\nIn the past four years in England, there has been a 35% increase in antibiotic-resistant blood infections. This is because there have been greater efforts by clinicians and other health professionals to identify sepsis cases.\n\nHowever, even though the absolute number of infections being detected has increased, the relative proportion of blood infections resistant to antibiotics has remained stable.\n\nFrom the point of view of health experts, a key to reduce antibiotic-resistant blood infections is to ensure that resistant bacteria cannot become prevalent in the first place.\n\nA recent report highlights that without effective antibiotics, life-threatening infections linked to operations such as hip replacements and Caesarean sections could increase.\n\nOverprescribing\n\nSince 2013, Public Health England has actively been campaigning to reduce the amount of antibiotics taken by patients.\n\nThey say that over-prescription of antibiotics is a major cause of the increase in resistance to them. This is because the more antibiotics are used are used, the less effective they become.\n\nIn addition, GPs have been prescribing antibiotics to patients who are not infected with bacterial diseases, even though they will never work.\n\nAntibiotic consumption in England has decreased by about 5% since 2013 - but the average daily dose per 1,000 people varies across the country.\n\nPublic Health England points out that antibiotic resistance and prescription are \"inextricably linked - areas with high levels of antibiotic prescribing also have high levels of resistance\".\n\nIts campaign involves ensuring all areas have access to best practices for using antibiotics - in particular in community care, as 90% of antibiotics are prescribed by GPs.\n\nThey want to see patients and carers educated about the inappropriate use of antibiotics and greater efforts by health professionals in preventing infections in the first place.\n\nAnd in 2016 the government called for a 50% reduction in the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics by 2021.\n\nAbout half of all patients with a cough or cold leave their GP's surgery with a prescription for antibiotics.\n\nAnd there are concerns that patient expectations are driving the problem.\n\nRecent research suggests 38% of people expect to be prescribed antibiotics when they go to the doctor.\n\nSo efforts are now being made not only to reduce the number of antibiotics prescribed but also for GPs not to prescribe antibiotics for conditions that will naturally clear up by themselves after a few days.\n\nHow does the UK compare?\n\nOver-prescription is not a problem unique to the UK.\n\nThe European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption Network has called the spread of drug-resistant bacteria a \"public health threat\", with estimates suggesting that 25,000 people die in Europe from linked infections every year.\n\nCurrently, the UK has below average consumption compared with other EU countries.\n\nEfforts to mitigate future costs related to the problem have led countries with high consumption to learn from others - in particular in northern Europe - who consume fewer antibiotics.\n\nThe global picture\n\nOne of the biggest global concerns regarding antibiotics is over drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB).\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), TB remains the world's deadliest infectious disease.\n\nTreatment has been effective, with an estimated 54 million lives saved through diagnosis and treatment between 2000 and 2017.\n\nEven so, and with the global incidence of TB falling at about 2% per year, it remains one of top 10 causes of death worldwide.\n\nIn 2017, 10 million people fell ill with TB and 1.6 million died from the disease, mainly in developing countries.\n\nThe WHO says that 490,000 people have multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), when bacteria do not respond to the two most powerful first-line anti-TB drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin.\n\nSecond-line drugs can treat and cure MDR-TB. However, such treatment options can mean that patients have to undergo up to two years of chemotherapy involving costly and toxic medicines.\n\nLooking to the future\n\nIt has been 30 years since a new class of antibiotic became available.\n\nAnd resistance has developed to all those that do exist.\n\nBut antibiotics are expensive to produce and can take a long time to become available to clinicians and patients.\n\nIn 2017, Public Health England warned that a failure to address resistance to antibiotics could lead to an estimated 10 million deaths every year globally by 2050 at a cost of \u00a366trillion in lost productivity to the global economy.\n\nThat is why they, and other health organisations, are calling for a reduction in the overuse and misuse of antibiotics."

It's the Holy Grail of influenza.\n\n\"There will be an appetite, but it depends how well these things work, how easy it is to produce and also how costly it will be.\"\n\nFollow James on Twitter."

It totally trusted me, lost all fear, it would take me on hunting expeditions and let me into its secret world.\n\n\"Octopuses have different personalities, some are quite bold, others very shy, she was in between,\" Mr Foster told the BBC, describing how she would come over and greet him when she became accustomed to his visits.\n\n\"It is a great privilege to step into that world to learn - not like a mammal - but like a fellow spineless creature in her invertebrate world,\" he said.\n\nHer den was mainly a hole she had dug in the ocean floor, which the diver described as a \"proper home\".\n\n\"She hunts over 50 species but you can only find that out when you're allowed into her den and can pick up the bones of the animals she has eaten,\" he said, referring to the lobster and crab shells he saw.\n\n\"You realise, my goodness, her life is so detailed and crazily connected to everything around her.\"\n\n'Human are not on a shark's menu'\n\nThe diver has also had amazing encounters with great white sharks, possibly some of the ones that have been responsible for attacks on surfers and bathers on surfers and bathers in nearby False Bay over the years.\n\nUnlike the aggressive hunters of human flesh they are often portrayed to be, he paints a totally different picture of a magnificent serene animal.\n\nImage copyright Sea Change Project Image caption There are more than 500 species of shark\n\n\"When the great white sees a human it scans us, its search image is picking up something that's not prey. They are not sure what we are, they may be curious but it's not something that's good for them to eat and they know that.\n\n\"They aren't animals that are after us, if they were, there would be attacks every day. If they see a seal, a fish or some of the other prey that's a different story but humans are not on their menu.\n\n\"The one attack a year is an aberration. There's something in that person they attack that's triggering a response in that shark, it's incredibly rare. Maybe it's the muscle tension that's high, maybe the shark is in a bad mood.\n\nYou may also want to read:\n\n\"I have made eye contact with them. I once had five great whites circling me in open water and I could see no aggression towards me whatsoever,\" Mr Foster said.\n\n\"I've had a couple of close meetings with Tiger Sharks but they're also very gentle if you're relaxed. These animals are not the killers they're made out to be.\"\n\nMr Frylinck, despite a scary maiden encounter with a big shark, has also become more comfortable with the much-feared animal.\n\n\"White sharks very rarely enter the kelp forest, they patrol the fringes. They swim around this bay which has one of the highest concentrations of white sharks in the world.\n\n\"One day we were swimming around the edge of the forest and Craig's friend Danny, who was with us, told me a white shark had just swum three to four metres away from my shoulder and had watched me quite intently. He described it as an absolute monster - between four and five metres,\" Mr Frylinck said.\n\nUnderwater tracks\n\nMr Foster, an award-winning film-maker of natural history, managed to adapt to the underwater world the tracking techniques he learnt in the Kalahari desert from the San people, widely regarded as being the best trackers in the world.\n\nImage copyright Sea Change Project Image caption The coast off Cape Town has a rich variety of sea life\n\n\"It involves a number of things like looking at subtle changes in sand and sand texture to see what animals have been around, looking to see if, for example, there's been a kill, if a worm has been digging, slime trails, egg casings - there are a multitude of signs underwater.\n\n\"Initially I thought it would be impossible to try and track underwater but I was desperate to try and break into this very cryptic world,\" he said.\n\n\"This crazy idea was in my mind for a long time and then eventually I started seeing the first underwater tracks, that's when I first thought it could work but I had no idea that I could develop it into such a detailed way understanding of animals underwater.\"\n\nDiving 365 days a year\n\nIt was this understanding that led to Mr Foster uncovering eight new species of shrimp, one of which - Heteromysis Fosteri - has been named after him.\n\nThe three new species, mostly bright red to orange in colour with series of either spots or stripes, belong to the genus Heteromysis and differ from previously known species by colour pattern, eye shape and the patterns of spines on their legs and tails.\n\nImage copyright Sea Change Project Image caption Argonauts are said to be rare visitors to the kelp forest off Cape Town's coast\n\nHaving managed to meet his commitment to do 365 dives a year, he said his interaction with sea life has made him realise the importance of changing the way he lives.\n\n\"The whole way I've been taught by other humans to live on this planet is completely unsustainable and I've also realised that these animals, particularly the phytoplankton, provide the oxygen for every breath I take. They provide the basis for every meal I have.\n\n\"They have taught me that all the financial, political and other issues we hear about in the news are inconsequential compared to that natural foundation that holds everything up and we're chipping away at it,\" Mr Foster said.\n\n\"We need to nurture it rather than doing the opposite.\"\n\nAll pictures from Sea Change Project."

reducing the strain on natural resources - a 2016 Swedish study unearthed evidence of an unusual drawback.\n\nIn her doctoral thesis at Lund University, Lina Nikoleris found the hormone ethinyl-estradiol (EE2) - a synthetic version of oestrogen found in birth control pills - was changing both the behaviour and genetics of some fish.\n\nWhen released into water as waste, EE2 was changing \"the genetic balance\" in fish such as salmon, trout and roach - which have more oestrogen receptors than humans.\n\nThe study also found EE2 made it harder for the fish to catch food.\n\n\"Previous studies have shown that the fish also develop problems with procreation,\" said Ms Nikoleris.\n\n\"This can lead to the complete disappearance of an entire fish population, and consequences for entire ecosystems.\"\n\nAvocados\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nBad news, avocado fans.\n\nNot only is your favourite breakfast component preventing you from getting on the housing ladder, it is also bad for the environment.\n\nThe Water Footprint Network, which campaigns for more efficient water use, calculated that it took around 272 litres of water to grow a single avocado - with a potentially devastating effect on regions where it is grown.\n\nIn 2011, an investigation by the Chilean water authority found at least 65 examples of avocado farms illegally diverting rivers and other water sources to their plantations.\n\nThat, in turn, was blamed for causing droughts, forcing local villagers to choose between drinking and washing.\n\nPineapples\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nAnother UK supermarket favourite also leaves a sour taste in the mouth.\n\nThe pineapple, which according to Tesco overtook the avocado as the fruit with the fastest-growing UK sales last year, is being grown at such a rate that it is having a detrimental impact on the environment in some parts of the world.\n\nIn Costa Rica, one of the world's largest producers, thousands of hectares of forest have been cleared to make way for pineapples.\n\nThe Costa Rican Conservationist Federation says complete forests have disappeared overnight, causing irreversible damage to the country.\n\nPineapples are grown in vast monocultures - the intense production of only one crop - and require a large amount of pesticides, which can also be harmful for the environment.\n\nShampoo\n\nImage copyright PA\n\nPalm oil is one of the most efficient and versatile vegetable oils on the planet - but its widespread use has led to significant deforestation.\n\nIn a 2018 report, conservation group the WWF warned the conversion of tropical forests and peat land to palm oil plantations was releasing \"massive quantities of carbon dioxide, fuelling climate change, and destroying the habitat of species like orangutans\".\n\nWhile you may be aware of palm oil's presence in edible products such as chocolate, margarine, ice cream, bread and biscuits, fewer people know of its role in numerous household products.\n\nIn shampoo, for example, palm oil is used as a form of conditioner to help maintain your hair's natural oils, which would otherwise be stripped away by chemicals.\n\nPalm oil is also found in products such as lipstick, washing detergents, hand soap and toothpaste.\n\nAir fresheners\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe dangerous levels of air pollution in the UK have been well publicised - but did you know that air fresheners could be part of the problem?\n\nA 2016 report, from the Royal College of Physicians, warned that it was not just outdoor air pollution which people needed to be wary of but also poor air quality in our homes, caused by everyday household products such as air fresheners.\n\nThese often contain a chemical called limonene, which is commonly used to give a citrus smell - and is also used in food.\n\nIt is not a chemical that poses a big hazard to health on its own but once released into the air it can become a problem.\n\nAn experiment carried out by the BBC's Trust Me, I'm a Doctor show found that when limonene reacted with the ozone present in air, it produced formaldehyde.\n\nEveryday exposure to formaldehyde may contribute to increasing incidences of asthma and other illnesses.\n\nLinks between formaldehyde and cancer were established in the 1980s, and since 2011 it's been listed as a known human carcinogen."

    "text": "In 2016, designer Liz Ciokajlo received a commission from the Museum of Modern Art (Moma) in New York: revisit the Moon Boot, a fluffy-looking snowshoe inspired by the footwear used by the Apollo astronauts.\n\nLaunched in 1972 at the height of the lunar missions, the Moon Boot is an icon of the 20th Century\u2019s \u2018plastic age\u2019 and the museum curators wanted a new take on it.\n\nCiokajlo set out to reimagine it. She knew only a biomaterial would work in a post-plastic age, but the designer also wanted a new destination to inspire it. Our generation\u2019s space travel obsession is not the Moon, she thought, but the red planet - Mars. And Mars allows you to really think outside of the box.\n\n\u201cMars has always been a place where you can dream,\u201d Ciokajlo says. \u201cIt is a place where you can reimagine how to live on Earth.\u201d\n\nYou might also like:\n\nThe final design can be manufactured with almost only human sweat and a few fungus spores, ideal for a seven-month trip to Mars with limited check-in luggage\n\nThe commission lead her to a wondrous biomaterial that had already attracted the attention of engineers innovating in building materials and of top space agencies like Nasa and the European Space Agency (Esa). Her final design, a tall, female, rough-looking boot, can be manufactured on board a spaceship with almost only human sweat and a few fungus spores, ideal for a seven-month trip to Mars with limited check-in luggage.\n\nThis magic biomaterial is mycelium, the vegetative part of the fungus. If you imagine that mushrooms are the \u2018fruits\u2019 of the fungus, mycelium could be regarded as its roots or stems. It looks like a mass of white thread-like structures, each called hyphae, which crisscross soil and other material in which fungi grows. Collectively, these threads are called mycelium and are the largest part of the fungus.\n\nMycelium has amazing properties. It is a great recycler, as it feeds off a substrate (like sawdust or agricultural waste) to create more material, and has the potential of almost limitless growth in the right conditions. It can endure more pressure than conventional concrete without breaking, is a known insulator and fire-retardant and could even provide radiation protection on space missions.\n\nOn Earth it\u2019s currently used to create ceiling panels, leather, packaging materials and building materials, but in outer space it stands out for its architectural potential, says artist and engineer Maurizio Montalti, who has teamed up with Ciokajlo.\n\n\u201cYou rely on the cells capacity to replicate themselves, thus creating more material in short time,\u201d says Montalti.\n\nFor her revisited boot, Ciokajlo wanted to use the human body as the source for some of the building materials and decided to employ sweat. Reusing perspiration is not entirely new in space exploration (the International Space Station currently reuses astronauts\u2019 urine and sweat for drinkable water) but a novelty approach for footwear. She thinks it might make astronauts feel closer to home during the long journey to Mars.\n\nMycelium materials can take shape in several ways\n\nMycelium\u2019s adventures in space go beyond material innovation. As she researched the commission, Ciokajlo came across a feminist novel from 1893 that imagined Mars as a planet where gender roles reversed \u2013 which is why their creation is a boot for women. The novel propelled her to imagine a new society where biomaterials provide a new way to interact with our surroundings. Even the boot\u2019s name, Caskia, comes from the novel: it is the planet\u2019s only region with equal standing between men and women.\n\nThe design is still hypothetical, because the real boot submitted for Moma \u2013 and currently in display at the London Design Museum \u2013 did use mycelium but not human sweat, as their deadline was too tight, but the science checks out.\n\nMycelium materials can take shape in several ways. If you have solid waste (like sawdust), you want to sterilise it and add the fungus so its spread can start. By incubating it in controlled conditions for temperature and humidity, the white veiny hyphae would compact to create a fibrous solid material. This is how Nasa and Esa hope to use mycelium for their Mars bases.\n\nFor Caskia, a special type of fungus (there are more than five million species) would feed off the nutrients diluted in human sweat after it is filtered for impurities. The \u2018wet material\u2019, as Montalti calls it, would be shaped with a mould directly around the astronaut\u2019s feet and kept fed by sweat production.\n\nIn both methods, the fungus growth can be stopped by heating to up to 70 or 80C (F), which means either using an oven on Earth or exposing the culture to high temperatures on Mars or outer space.\n\nThe substrate would possibly need an additional nutritional supplement to promote its growth, acknowledges Moltalti, but it is rooted in current mycelium science. The boot they created for MoMA used a special diluted formula.\n\n\u201cFor each of our cultural inspirations you could find scientists that back this up,\u201d says Ciokajlo.\n\nThe European Space Agency (Esa) is likewise pushing boundaries with mycelium. In a joint project with Montalti and the University of Utrecht, the agency is exploring whether fungi could be used to grow buildings, like labs and other facilities, in space.\n\nLaunching from Earth with a fully formed Mars facility is expensive, with payload prices ranging at $10,000 (\u00a37,700) per pound. Mining in Mars is also problematic and costly. Add that to the ever-present question of how to manage waste in space, and mycelium\u2019s ability to decompose and recycle starts to look very promising.\n\nThe team had provisional results in October and Montalti says they are encouraging (Esa is still double-checking them, so they are not yet public). The engineer dreams about combining mycelium with 3D printing or even genetic manipulation to have more options.\n\n\n\nOn our planet, many projects have used mycelium as a structural component\n\nOn the other side of the Atlantic, Nasa is also examining whether their Mars missions could grow surface structures on the planet itself. The Americans are considering producing on Earth a flexible plastic shell seeded with mycelium and then activating the fungal growth once in Mars. That way a thin film can become thick roof or walls in a matter of days or weeks. The building could be malleable: fungus growth stops when their feedstock is consumed, their ideal temperature is withdrawn or the mycelia is killed via heat, yet the dormant fungi can be reactivated into growth, if repairs are needed.\n\nOne of the most appealing aspects of mycelium in relation to space architecture is the capacity of certain fungi to express melanin, a biomolecule that can shield humans from cosmic radiation. Montalti and ESA tested this property as part of their project.\n\nOn our planet, many projects have used mycelium as a structural component. For instance, a collaboration between the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) used 3D printing to create a branching structure that can support a roof.\n\nFor many, mycelium provides a golden example of circular economy. Waste comes in as input for the mycelium and the resulting material is potentially biodegradable, just like wood.\n\n\u201cCurrently our materials come from extraction,\u201d says architect Adi Reza Nugroho, from the Indonesian firm MycoTech that provided the mycelium for ETH and KIT. \u201cNow we want to have a closed-loop cycle.\u201d\n\nIf Nasa and Esa\u2019s experiments are successful, a small group of fungus spores could provide the starting point for a living, natural settlement on Mars. From a handful of spores, they could replicate and find dozens of uses for astronauts walking around the red planet.\n\nAnd if Ciokajlo and Montalti have it their way, and these humans can spare a bit of their sweat, even the shoes on their feet will start life as a fungus.\n\n--\n\nDiego Arguedas Ortiz is a science and climate change reporter.

    "title": "Is it time to stop blaming your diet for acne?",
    "authors": [
      "Anjali Mahto"
    ],
    "text": "This article was originally published by Refinery29. Read the original post here.\n\nAs a consultant dermatologist based in London, I have been seeing patients with skin conditions for well over a decade. Acne is one of my main areas of interest. Over the past few years, there are some observations I have made which are causing me concern: with the rise of 'wellness' and its stubborn persistence, my increasing worry is how it is affecting our relationship with food in the context of managing skin problems.\n\nLet me give you a bit of background. I am aware that I see a self-selecting group of patients in my private clinics. Many suffer with a longstanding history of acne, most are female and from an affluent background \u2013 that is the nature of working in exclusive areas of London. Like many of us, they are intelligent, clued-up women who care not only about their skin health, but also their general health.\n\nBy the time many of them are sitting opposite me in clinic for their acne, they have already exhausted numerous avenues of treatment. This includes changing their skincare, often having spent thousands trying to find the right product, as well as manipulating their diet.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 Is sugar really bad for you?\n\n\u2022 Why we get acne\n\n\u2022 Is drinking water good for your skin?\n\nThe nutrition aspect is a trend that I am finding hard to ignore. Patients are telling me how they are cutting out dairy, gluten and sugar in an attempt to clear their spots. Many are actively restricting food to the point where it is clear to me it has become an unhealthy obsession: finding excuses not to go to dinner with friends, refusing to eat a slice of birthday cake that has been lovingly made by a family member, skipping meals when out and about as there is no 'clean' caf\u00e9 that can provide 'acceptable' or 'allowed' food. What I am dealing with is not just the acne itself, but also a very real fear of certain foods.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at the evidence. What is the relationship with acne and diet?\n\nThe link has been discussed for decades and remains controversial. Doing good quality dietary studies is difficult and many rely on people's memory of what they ate in the past. Can you accurately recall what you ate last week, let alone 10 years ago? (Find out more in our BBC Future article Can chocolate give you spots?).\n\nSugar may have some part to play \u2013 but the way I would translate this is not to cut out sugar altogether, but to be mindful of consumption\n\nWhat we do know is that there is a growing relationship between acne development and food that has a high glycaemic index (GI) \u2013 so, potentially, sugar has some part to play. The way I would translate this, however, is not to cut out sugar altogether but be mindful of consumption. This isn\u2019t just good for your skin, but also for your general wellbeing.\n\nThe link with dairy is actually much weaker. Still, it may have a role in acne in a small, select group of people \u2013 not everyone! For reasons that are not fully understood, low fat dairy seems to be worse than full fat. There is no acne guideline in the UK or the US which recommends cutting out dairy for the treatment of acne. There are plenty of people I see following a vegan diet who still have spots.\n\nLikewise, I have lots of patients who have cut out whole food groups, but their spots persist. Labelling food as the problem is too simplistic and fails to take account of the multi-factorial nature of acne, which includes variations in hormones and genetics.\n\nIf food restrictions weren\u2019t bad enough, the second thing I can\u2019t ignore is food shaming. This is where people think it is socially acceptable to pass unsolicited advice or judgement on someone\u2019s eating habits, blaming them for their skin disease. This has happened to me, too. The stranger in the street who tells you that you have acne because you\u2019re eating ice cream on a hot summer\u2019s day. The concerned relative who tells you to put the chocolate down as it\u2019s obviously giving you spots. The troll on social media who tells you that it\u2019s not surprising you have bad skin because you posted a picture of a slice of pizza.\n\nWe are living in a world of information overload. Everyone has a voice and a platform and social media allows us to reach a wider audience that would not have been possible 20 years ago. But how does one sort out the scientifically credible voices from the charlatans?\n\nJust because something works for one person doesn't mean it will work for you\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling desperate because of your spots and your self-esteem is in your boots, it is totally understandable why you would turn to the internet for advice. The difficulty is that not all advice is created equal, and there is a lot of conflicting information \u2013 sometimes even coming from health professionals themselves. And just because something works for one person doesn't mean it will work for you. We are all individuals, with our unique DNA, environment and gut and skin microbiome.\n\nAcne has already been linked to a number of mental health concerns such as anxiety, depression, social isolation and poor body image. Telling people who are already vulnerable to developing mental health issues to then restrict their diet is a worry. But it is happening all over social media, where people \u2013 bloggers, via naturopaths and functional medicine \u2013 promise to get to the 'root of the problem'.\n\nNo one is denying that good nutrition is important for your skin. Food has multiple roles in skin health and disease. But this is not the same as making people feel bad about their dietary choices by offering uninvited advice that is not rooted in science. This creates an unfair blame culture, criticising people who are already struggling. Patients are telling me that comments like this are affecting their mental health or creating disordered eating patterns. Many worry much more about what they eat, or think twice about eating that sugary food in public. Friends who work in nutrition and psychology tell me that I\u2019m not alone, and that they are seeing the same thing in their clinics.\n\nSo what is the solution? If you are suffering with acne and any of this resonates, then it is important to seek medical help. Likewise, if you are noticing a loved one becoming wary around food because of their spots, please encourage them to talk to someone. Be open with your GP or dermatologist about your concerns around food. It can be really helpful to work with a team of people such as a dietitian and psychologist alongside having your skin treated.\n\nFood does not have to be 'good' or 'bad' \u2013 the labels are too binary. Eating well for your skin is about sustained eating patterns over time, not just that packet of sweets you ate today.\n\nDr Anjali Mahto is a consultant dermatologist and author of The Skincare Bible: Your No-Nonsense Guide To Good Skin.\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

There can be health risks associated with a low BMI such as anaemia, osteoporosis, a weakened immune system and fertility problems. This is not a medical diagnostic tool so don't panic if this isn't the result you were expecting to see. If you're concerned about your weight, or your health in general, speak to a healthcare professional such as your GP. You're in the healthy range which is great. Research shows that having a healthy BMI can reduce your risk of serious health problems, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke and some cancers. But not all people with a BMI in this range have a lower risk. Other factors such as smoking, high blood cholesterol or high blood pressure will increase your risk. If you're of Asian descent you have a higher risk of heart disease and diabetes at a lower BMI and waist circumference. A healthy BMI for you would be 18.5-23. We're more likely to gain weight as we get older so to stay a healthy weight you may need to make small changes to your diet or your activity levels as you age.

Your waist size BMI is not the only way of measuring whether you are a healthy weight. Doctors say that carrying too much fat around your belly can increase your risk of health problems. Excess fat in this area can stress internal organs - even if your BMI is in the healthy range. Your waist size is [size] For [gender_plural], the NHS says a waist size of: 80cm (31.5 inches) or more means an increased risk of health problems 88cm (34 inches) or more means a very high risk of health problems 94cm (37 inches) or more means an increased risk of health problems 102cm (40 inches) or more means a very high risk of health problems People from non-white ethnic groups may be at risk at a lower waist size How to check your waist with just a piece of string\n\nIf you can't see the calculator tap or click here.\n\nSome experts have questioned whether BMI is an accurate way of analysing a person's health.\n\nHowever, Dr Katarina Kos, senior lecturer in Diabetes and Obesity at the University of Exeter, believes it is.\n\n\"For the majority of people, BMI is a good measure,\" she told the BBC.\n\nDr Kos added that the report did not contain any surprises but added that overweight people who could lower their BMI may reap the health benefits.\n\n\"We know from the diabetes remission data how low-calorie diets and weight loss can improve diabetes, for example,\" she said.\n\n\"And we know weight loss can also help in improving risk so that would also then improve mortality rates.\"\n\nThe report suggested that a higher BMI in older people may not be as dangerous, because a bit of extra weight was \"protective\" for them.\n\nBut Dr Kos, who worked on a report on this topic in 60 to 69-year-olds last year, disagreed with the findings.\n\nHer report, on what is known as the obesity risk paradox, did not \"support acceptance\" of the theory."

Five things you can do to help stop rising global temperatures\n\nWhat had the researchers initially claimed?\n\nAccording to the last major assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world's oceans have taken up more than 90% of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases.\n\nBut the new study claimed that every year, for the past 25 years, we have put about 150 times the amount of energy used to generate electricity globally into the seas - 60% more than previous estimates.\n\nThe authors suggested that this had huge implications for the way that the world is warming.\n\nIf far more heat than previously believed was going into oceans, it also meant that far more heat than we thought has been generated by the warming gases we have emitted in the world to date.\n\nTherefore more heat from the same amount of gas means the Earth is more sensitive to CO2.\n\nImage copyright VictorHuang\n\nWhat had these scientists done differently?\n\nSince 2007, scientists have been able to rely on a system of almost 4,000 Argo floats that record temperature and salinity in the oceans around the world.\n\nBut prior to this, the methods used to measure the heat in the ocean had many flaws and uncertainties.\n\nThe team involved in the study used a new approach to measuring the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the air. They believed that this allowed them to accurately measure ocean temperatures globally, dating back to 1991, when data from a global network of stations became available.\n\nThe key element in this methodology is the fact that, as waters get warmer, they release more carbon dioxide and oxygen into the air.\n\n\"When the ocean warms, the amount of these gases that the ocean is able to hold goes down,\" said lead author Dr Laure Resplandy from Princeton University.\n\n\"So what we measured was the amount lost by the oceans, and then we can calculate how much warming we need to explain that change in gases.\"\n\nImage copyright monkeybusinessimages\n\nSo how were the errors detected?\n\nThey were discovered by a mathematician, Nicholas Lewis, who has long been critical of climate models, arguing that they are over-sensitive to emissions of carbon dioxide.\n\nHe reviewed the paper when it was published and found what he termed \"serious (but surely inadvertent) errors in the underlying calculations.\"\n\nThe key element deals with the amount of uncertainty in the measurements. As a result of the increased margin of error, the findings on the amount of heat being absorbed by the oceans can't be definitively supported.\n\nHow have the authors reacted?\n\nThey've put their hands up and acknowledged the error.\n\nRalph Keeling, who co-authored the study said in a statement that he takes responsibility for the \"oversights\" and would like to \"thank Nicholas Lewis for bringing an apparent anomaly in the trend calculation to our attention.\"\n\n\"These problems do not invalidate the methodology or the new insights into ocean biogeochemistry on which it is based, but they do influence the mean rate of warming we infer, and more importantly, the uncertainties of that calculation.\"\n\nThe authors say they have now reworked their calculations and submitted a correction to the journal, Nature, which originally published the study.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world\n\nWhat have the publishers of the report said?\n\nThey have issued an editor's note about the issue.\n\n\"We would like to alert readers that the authors have informed us of errors in the paper. An implication of the errors is that the uncertainties in ocean heat content are substantially underestimated. We are working with the authors to establish the quantitative impact of the errors on the published results, at which point in time we will provide a further update.\"\n\nWhat does all this mean for ocean warming?\n\nAccording to the scientists involved in the original study, the ocean is still probably warming more than the estimate used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. But the errors mean that it has a larger range of probability - between 10% and 70%. This is in line with other studies.\n\n\"Our error margins are too big now to really weigh in on the precise amount of warming that's going on in the ocean,\" Ralph Keeling said. \"We really muffed the error margins.\"\n\nUPDATE: The original version of this story was published before the errors in the study came to light."

    "text": "Halloween is a time when ghosts and spooky decorations are on public display, reminding us of the realm of the dead. But could they also be instructing us in important lessons on how to lead moral lives?\n\nThe origins of modern-day Halloween date back to \u2018samhain\u2019, a Celtic celebration for the beginning of the dark half of the year when, it was widely believed, the realm between the living and the dead overlapped and ghosts could be commonly encountered.\n\nIn 601 AD, to help his drive to convert northern Europe to Christianity, Pope Gregory I directed missionaries not to stop pagan celebrations, but rather to Christianise them.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 The truth about the paranormal\n\n\u2022 The camera tricks that can summon ghosts\n\n\u2022 Why science says you need a nap\n\nAccordingly, over time, the celebrations of samhain became All Souls\u2019 Day and All Saint\u2019s Day, when speaking with the dead was considered religiously appropriate. All Saint\u2019s Day was also known as All Hallows\u2019 Day and the night before became All Hallows\u2019 Evening, or \u2018Hallowe\u2019en\u2019.\n\nNot only did the pagan beliefs around spirits of the dead continue, but they also became part of many of early church practices.\n\nLucrative belief\n\nPope Gregory I himself suggested that people seeing ghosts should say masses for them. The dead, in this view, might require help from the living to make their journey towards Heaven.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, beliefs about souls trapped in purgatory led to the church\u2019s increasing practice of selling indulgences \u2013 payments to the church to reduce penalties for sins. The widespread belief in ghosts turned the sale of indulgences into a lucrative practice for the church.\n\nIt was such beliefs that contributed to the Reformation, the division of Christianity into Protestantism and Catholicism led by German theologian Martin Luther. Indeed, Luther\u2019s 95 Theses, nailed to the All Saints Church in Wittenburg on 31 October 1517, was largely a protest against the selling of indulgences.\n\nSubsequently, ghosts became identified with \u2018Catholic superstitions\u2019 in Protestant countries.\n\nDebates, however, continued about the existence of ghosts and people increasingly turned to science to deal with the issue. By the 19th Century, Spiritualism, a new movement which claimed that the dead could converse with the living, was fast becoming mainstream, and featured popular techniques such as seances, the ouija board, spirit photography and the like.\n\nAlthough Spiritualism faded in cultural importance after World War One, many of its approaches can be seen in the \u2018ghost hunters\u2019 of today, who often seek to prove the existence of ghosts using scientific techniques.\n\nIn Taiwan, for example, about 90% of people report seeing ghosts\n\nThese beliefs are not just part of the Christian world. Most, although not all, societies have a concept of \u2018ghosts\u2019. In Taiwan, for example, about 90% of people report seeing ghosts.\n\nAlong with many Asian countries such as Japan, Korea, China and Vietnam, Taiwan celebrates a Ghost Month, which includes a central Ghost Day, when ghosts are believed to freely roam the world of the living. These festivals and beliefs are often tied to the Buddhist story of the Urabon Sutra, where Buddha instructs a young priest on how to help his mother whom he sees suffering as a \u2018hungry ghost\u2019.\n\nAs in many traditions, Taiwanese ghosts are seen either as \u2018friendly\u2019 or \u2018unfriendly\u2019. The friendly ghosts are commonly ancestral or familial and are welcomed into the home during the ghost festival. The unfriendly ghosts are those that are angry or \u2018hungry\u2019 and haunt the living.\n\nMoral reminder\n\nAs a mythology scholar at the University of Southern California who has studied and taught ghost stories for many years, I have found that ghosts generally \u2018haunt\u2019 for good reasons. These could range from unsolved murders, lack of proper funerals, forced suicides, preventable tragedies and other ethical failures.\n\nGhosts, in this light, are often seeking justice from beyond the grave. They could make such demands from individuals, or from societies as a whole. For example, in the US, sightings have been reported of African-American slaves and murdered Native Americans. Scholar Elizabeth Tucker, from Binghamton State University of New York, details many of these reported sightings on university campuses, often tied to sordid aspects of the campus\u2019s past.\n\nSightings are often a reminder that ethical lapses can carry a heavy spiritual burden\n\nIn this way, ghosts reveal the shadow side of ethics. Their sightings are often a reminder that ethics and morality transcend our lives and that ethical lapses can carry a heavy spiritual burden.\n\nYet ghost stories are also hopeful. In suggesting a life after death, they offer a chance to be in contact with those that have passed and therefore a chance for redemption \u2013 a way to atone for past wrongs.\n\nThis Halloween, along with the shrieks and shtick, you may want to take a few minutes to appreciate the role of ghosts in our haunted pasts and how they guide us to lead moral and ethical lives.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Conversation, and is republished under a Creative Commons licence.\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\n\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

Only restricted military systems see finer detail.\n\n\"Satellites have improved so much with their spatial resolution,\" explained Hannah Cubaynes, who is affiliated to both Cambridge University and BAS.\n\n\"For the first time we've been able to see features that are truly distinctive of whales, such as their flippers and flukes.\"\n\nImage caption At a resolution of 31cm, species identification becomes much easier\n\nWhat have the scientists done?\n\nMs Cubaynes' team examined WorldView-3 photos in different parts of the globe, looking for fin whales in the northern Mediterranean; humpbacks off Hawaii; southern rights around the Pen\u00ednsula Vald\u00e9s, Argentina; and Pacific grey whales in Laguna San Ignacio, Mexico.\n\nThese are all baleens (filter feeders) and among the biggest cetaceans, reaching up to 15m or 20m in length.\n\nThe animals are detected just below, or even breaching, the sea surface. The fins and greys proved to be the easiest to identify in the pictures, in large part because their body colour contrasts well with the surrounding water and because they tend to swim parallel to the sea surface.\n\nBut, crucially, the team was able to make out the body shapes associated with the different animals, proving satellite-identification is a viable technique.\n\nImage copyright 2018 DigitalGlobe, a Maxar company Image caption WorldView-3 produces the sharpest pictures in the public domain\n\nWhy count whales from space?\n\nCurrently, most surveys are conducted from the air, from boats and sometimes from a promontory, such as a high sea-cliff. But these are very localised searches, and whales are known to range across hundreds of thousands of square km.\n\nSome of their feeding grounds will be far from land. Without more effective means to track the animals, we cannot really say how well they are recovering after centuries of over-exploitation.\n\n\"This is a potential game-changer - to be able to survey whales unhindered by the cost and difficulty of deploying planes and boats,\" said Dr Jennifer Jackson, BAS's top whale expert.\n\n\"Whales are a really important indicator of ecosystem health. By being able to gather information on the grandest scales afforded by satellite imagery, we can understand something more generally about the oceans' health and that's really important for marine conservation.\"\n\nImage copyright Rose Cole Image caption Counting from boats and planes works - but only over small areas\n\nDon't we already count smaller animals from orbit?\n\nThis is true - to an extent. BAS has already pioneered the use of satellite imagery to monitor penguins and albatrosses, for example. But there are crucial differences.\n\nIn the case of penguins, it is not really individual birds that are counted; rather it is the general size of a colony that is assessed from the black mass of animals huddled together on the their ice habitat.\n\nAnd in the case of albatrosses, the scientists know exactly where to look because the birds' breeding sites are restricted to just a handful of compact locations. A nest is just big enough to show up on a satellite picture, enabling an estimate to be made of the likely number of albatross pairs.\n\nSpacecraft will gather huge image swaths when they pass over the ocean. With the exceptional resolution now available, counting individual whales becomes practical. In a 31cm-resolution image, for instance, a grey whale's fluke will take up 10 pixels.\n\nImage caption Fin whale: Colour contrast helps with their identification\n\nWhere does this research go next?\n\nThe team is now testing various algorithms that can search satellite images automatically.\n\nThe best will shortly be applied to a WorldView-3 dataset covering the Ligurian Sea.\n\n\"The whole area is 36,000 sq km. This is simply too big to search manually,\" said BAS co-researcher Dr Peter Fretwell. \"It's a marine protected area and the worry is that there's a lot of boat traffic moving between Corsica, Italy and France.\n\n\"They're concerned about ship strikes and and we may be able to establish some information about fin whales' behaviour that will be helpful to ships' captains.\"\n\nSatellites continue to improve. DigitalGlobe, for example, plans a new constellation that promises to dramatically increase the rate at which the high-resolution pictures are acquired.\n\nAllied to the latest data analytics techniques, this should be a boon to marine biologists and ecologists.\n\nNot only will they get more robust numbers for live whale populations, but they should also have a much better idea of how many dead animals are stranding on remote coastlines around the the world.\n\nMs Cubaynes and colleagues have published their research in the journal Marine Mammal Science.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"

    "text": "Ever wondered how the chemical element strontium was named; why we use \u2018byzantine\u2019 to describe something that\u2019s extremely complex; which area gave the world the fruit known as the tangerine; or where the daiquiri cocktail was invented? Around the World in 80 Words: A Journey Through the English Language is a place-based guide to 80 wide-ranging words, including the examples above. The book, by prolific language writer Paul Anthony Jones, covers 65 countries and more than 70,000 miles as it shows the extent to which locations have influenced English vocabulary. (And those answers are: Strontium, Scotland; Byzantium, Turkey; Tangier, Morocco; and Daiquir\u00ed, Cuba.)\n\nMore like this:\n\n- Will we stop speaking and just text?\n\n- The ancient \u2018viral memes\u2019 still with us\n\n- The rebirth of Cornish and other lost UK languages\n\nEnglish is unusually promiscuous for a European language, having borrowed words from a great many others. This geographical diversity is very much on display in Around the World in 80 Words. Initially Jones thought about compiling an A to Z list of place-derived words, but he realised that there needed to be a link between the words.\n\nAfter grouping his growing list of words into regions, he hit upon the idea of linking them via a route: the round-the-world journey that Phileas Fogg famously undertakes on a bet in Jules Verne\u2019s Around the World in 80 Days. As Jones explains, his intention \u201cwas to mix together words like \u2018Brazil nut\u2019 and \u2018turkey\u2019 and those sorts of things that we do know come from places, but also drop in some other ones that you may be quite surprised have place names behind them\u201d.\n\nFowl play\n\nIn particular, \u2018turkey\u2019 has a peculiar history. The poultry has little to do with the country. Essentially, the name reflects a 16th-Century trade in birds that seemed exotic to English diners. Jones says, \u201cwe ended up with a word that comes from a place that has absolutely nothing to do with it. It just so happens that large birds were imported onto dining tables from the Eastern Mediterranean, so we just borrowed that word, even though the birds themselves came from the other side of the world.\u201d\n\nIn Turkish, the animal is known as hindi, although in Hindi, the animal\u2019s name is the very turkey-ish tark\u012b.\n\nBut English speakers weren\u2019t the only confused ones. The bird is called \u2018Indian chicken\u2019, \u2018Malay chicken\u2019, \u2018Dutch chicken\u2019, \u2018French chicken\u2019, or peru in various languages. In Turkish, the animal is known as hindi, although in Hindi, the animal\u2019s name is the very turkey-ish tark\u012b.\n\nBeyond \u2018turkey\u2019, the geographical origin stories in Jones\u2019s book show how geographically inaccurate (or inventive) so many English terms are. The Panama hat is from Ecuador but started to be traded internationally in Panama, while the conga dance is from Latin America but takes its name from the Congo. And the cocktail known as a Black Russian was invented in Belgium, while a Great Dane was originally bred in Germany.\n\nDoggone words\n\nIn fact, Jones had to limit the number of dog breeds to include in the book. As with the other entries in the book, names for dogs in English often reference the places where the breeds were developed. Jones says wryly, \u201cif it was up to me I would have written a whole book about dogs, but you know you can\u2019t have 80 chapters of \u2018this dog breed was born in this area\u2019\u201d.\n\nNames of dog breeds, far from being frivolous, have been swept up into geopolitical tensions. For instance, the \u2018Alsatian wolf-dog\u2019 comes from Alsace, a territory contested by France and Germany for many years. These canines are better known in English as German shepherds, although during the world wars, many English speakers preferred to call them \u2018Alsatian wolf-dogs\u2019 or simply \u2018Alsatians\u2019.\n\nSimilarly, German boarhounds were renamed Great Danes (possibly as a reference to an earlier breed known as grand danois in French). Great Danes may be Great, but they\u2019re not Danish.\n\nThe canine-themed nationalism went in both directions. Certain long-legged hunting hounds bred in Germany were initially called Englischer Hundes, or \u2018English dogs\u2019, because their mix included English breeds. In Germany, they were renamed Deutsche Dogges, or \u2018German dogs\u2019, even before the world wars.\n\nBadge of dishonour\n\nAs well as the deliberately altered place-origin words, some everyday words are altered forms of place names that English speakers found difficult to pronounce. For example, \u2018doolally\u2019 is one of the many silly-sounding words used in British English. Yet it has serious origins.\n\nThis piece of military slang term referred to a military camp in the town of Deolali, set up in 1861. British soldiers would depart from Deolali for Britain during the winter and spring, the only seasons when the weather made this feasible. The soldiers who arrived in Deolali outside of these months faced a long wait to return home. This wait was in squalid conditions where soldiers had little to do, and many were still grappling with the horrors of the combat they\u2019d experienced. The combination of boredom, squalor, and likely PTSD led to high rates of suicide and psychological stress. So Deolali, and then its Anglicised version \u2018doolally\u2019, became a general term for derangement, especially of the temporary kind.\n\nTo \u2018Stellenbosch\u2019 a person is to move them aside without necessarily demoting them\n\nMany of the coinages in 80 Words came out of military history, in fact. As with the dog-breed words, Jones had to stop himself from overstuffing the book with war-related terms. This was also potentially tricky because Jones was asking himself, \u201cCan I tell the story of another war that the English have been involved in? It\u2019s difficult because it can be quite a touchy subject\u2026 the kind of influence that Britain has had across the globe.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019s favourite among the 80 words is actually a military coinage. Stellenbosch is a town in South Africa, which was first a Dutch and then a British colony. It also used to be used as a verb. During the Anglo-Boer War of 1899-1902, British officers who didn\u2019t distinguish themselves were relegated to caring for horses in the Stellenbosch encampment. This was an important job but not a frontline position, so to \u2018Stellenbosch\u2019 a person is to move them aside without necessarily demoting them. Jones calls this \u201can eminently useful word\u201d, though it\u2019s little used today. He notes its relevance to business owners whose decision-making powers are stripped away by company boards, or to football managers who are shunted aside but officially remain in power. Jones is hoping that this sense of \u2018Stellenbosch\u2019 will have a resurgence.\n\nUnlike \u2018Stellenbosch\u2019, \u2018Balkanisation\u2019 persists, to describe fragmentation. Remarkably, it dates back to far earlier than the splitting of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, as it initially referred to independence movements in the Balkan region in the early 20th Century.\n\nIt may be unfair that certain regions continue to be associated with a perception of trauma or trouble in the English language. But Jones points out that this stigma can disappear over time. \u2018Vandemonianism\u2019 derives from an old word for Tasmania, and denotes the criminal behaviour of people in the convict colony. This association, like the word, is mostly gone.\n\nFound in translation\n\nThe bookalso reveals the outsize influence that certain languages and locations have had on English. Some of this is related to proximity and royal history: it notes that French, for instance, provides the etymological roots of nearly one-third of the English language. Italian, ancient Greek, and Indian languages are among the others that have significantly shaped English.\n\nIn the course of his research, Jones was surprised to see how influential South Africa has been on British English, even if verbs like \u2018Stellenbosch\u2019 haven\u2019t proved enduring. Conversely, he expected more borrowings from Canada, yet \u201cyou\u2019re hard pushed to find sort of a specific Canadianism in the dictionary\u201d. (This may be because Canadian English is a rather ambivalent amalgam of other variants of English.)\n\nJones also had to do a lot of hunting to find words from West Africa and Eastern Europe. As well, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a lot of Norse words that come from way back in the sort of old English period where the Vikings brought them over. But in terms of modern influence from Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland \u2015 countries that we\u2019re culturally very close to and historically very close to \u2013 there\u2019s not as much modern influence as I was expecting.\u201d\n\nA trip of the tongue\n\nSo what does this armchair trip around the world reveal about the English language? For one thing, as is sometimes bemoaned by language learners, English is incredibly fruitful. Jones explains, \u201cwe\u2019ve got something like 25% more words than the nearest language to us\u201d, so there\u2019s a lot of vocabulary to absorb \u2013 including from locations around the world.\n\nAt the same time, regionalisms are unlikely to disappear. Jones lives in Newcastle, for instance, which retains many specific terms (even if Geordies are unlikely to ever call something as common as coal in Newcastle). And the book details some of the many odd place-based words derived from the English Southwest, from \u2018Cornish pasties\u2019 to \u2018not a word of Penzance\u2019 (referring to a lack of support).\n\nEven though the internet has sped up the pace of language development, Jones believes that the role of local dialects will remain strong. For instance, \u201cthere are going to be words that you use in conversation with your friends where you live and where you grew up, that you wouldn't necessarily use in writing\u201d.\n\nThere\u2019s another possibility for place-based linguistic influence\u2026 If humans do ever encounter cultures from other parts of the universe, Jones says, \u201cI wouldn't be surprised if we end up sort of hoovering up words from them as well. It\u2019s what we've done for centuries, so we\u2019re going to continue.\u201d\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

      "Environment Correspondent"
    ],
    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nPalau is set to become the first country to impose a widespread ban on sunscreen in an effort to protect its vulnerable coral reefs.\n\nThe government has signed a law that restricts the sale and use of sunscreen and skincare products that contain a list of ten different chemicals.\n\nResearchers believe that these ingredients are highly toxic to marine life, and can make coral more susceptible to bleaching.\n\nThe ban comes into force in 2020.\n\nIn a statement, Palau's President Tommy Remengesau said the ban, which would see fines of $1,000 (\u00a3760) for retailers who violated the law, was timely.\n\n\"The power to confiscate sunscreens should be enough to deter their non-commercial use, and these provisions walk a smart balance between educating tourists and scaring them away.\"\n\nHow do sunscreen products harm corals?\n\nScientists have been raising concerns about the impacts of sunscreen products on marine life for many years.\n\nThey are particularly worried over the role of two ingredients called oxybenzone and octinoxate. These are used as sun protection factors as they absorb ultraviolet light.\n\nHowever, they are believed to make coral more susceptible to bleaching. Research published in 2015 showed that the oxybenzone could stunt the growth of baby corals and was toxic to several different coral species in laboratory tests.\n\n\"Oxybenxzone is probably the baddest actor out of the 10 chemicals that have been banned,\" said Dr Craig Downs, an expert on the impacts of sunscreens on marine life.\n\n\"It causes corals to bleach at lower temperatures, and it reduces their resilience to climate change.\"\n\nDr Downs says that when there's a disastrous event like mass coral bleaching, reefs should recover over the following years. That has not been happening in many parts of the world.\n\nImage copyright Global_Pics Image caption A diver among the corals in Palau\n\n\"Life doesn't scramble back in where there are tourists,\" said Dr Downs. \"The juvenile phase of coral are more susceptible to chemical pollution than adults. That's why we see these areas not coming back.\"\n\n\"They are coral reef zombies. Only the adults are left and it's only a matter of time before they go.\"\n\nHow much of a threat does sunscreen pose?\n\nResearchers say that the biggest threat to coral reefs is climate change, with estimates that 90% of reefs will succumb to rising temperatures by 2050. The second biggest threat is the suffocating threat posed by algal blooms, triggered by the runoff of nutrients from sewage and farming. Sunscreen is now seen as one of a number of other, lesser threats including ocean acidification.\n\nImage copyright Global_Pics Image caption Sunscreen has already been banned at Jellyfish Lake in Palau\n\nHow widely used are the banned sunscreen chemicals?\n\nIt has been estimated that between 6-14,000 tonnes of sunscreen wash off people and go into reef areas every year. Researchers say that several thousand sun protection products contain the two most threatening chemicals.\n\nFive years ago it was estimated to be in around 75% of products. Experts now say it's found in about half of creams and lotions.\n\nRight now the US Congress is looking at legislation to ban oxybenzone, based on the threat it poses to human health.\n\nWhy Palau and why now?\n\nPalau is located in the western part of the Pacific ocean. It is made up of one large volcanic island and several smaller coral reef associated islands. Despite its small size, it has often taken big steps in protecting the environment.\n\nIn 2015, it designated almost its entire ocean territory as a marine protected zone. Very aware of the threats of climate change, Palau became the second nation in the world after Fiji to ratify the Paris climate agreement in 2016.\n\nWhen it comes to coral reefs, the island nation has largely avoided the negative impacts of extensive coastal erosion from agriculture, pollution and rampant overfishing that have affected reefs elsewhere.\n\nThe ban on sunscreen products means Palau is determined to fight any threat to the reefs, which are visited by thousands of tourists every year.\n\nProf J\u00f6rg Wiedenmann, who studies coral ecosystems at the University of Southampton, UK, said: \"It is a sensible precaution to prevent the exposure of the vulnerable corals from the potential threats by sunscreen products in these places.\n\n\"However, reefs cannot be saved by banning sunscreens alone. There are more destructive drivers of reef decline such as sea water warming, overfishing, nutrient enrichment and pollution that need to be controlled to halt the ongoing degradation of reef ecosystems.\"\n\nHas anyone else looked to ban sunscreen with these ingredients?\n\nYes - several regions have imposed bans, including the island of Bonaire in the Caribbean and the US state of Hawaii which passed a law earlier this year. Mexico has banned sunscreen in nature reserves.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A view of some of the islands that make up Palau\n\nThe Palau restriction is set to be the most comprehensive yet, covering 10 chemicals. They include four that have an antimicrobial effect but have also been shown in the scientific literature to act as endocrine disruptors.\n\nExperts say that dozens of other countries may now look to replicate the Palau ban.\n\nAre there alternatives that don't contain these chemicals?\n\nYes, there are alternatives that don't include the two key chemicals that are being marketed as \"reef-safe\". But some scientists argue that the term is not legally enforceable, and there is no compulsion on manufacturers to demonstrate that their products don't harm coral.\n\nDr Craig Downs says the first line of protection against the sun should be clothing with built-in sun protection.\n\n\"From a conservation point of view, if you wear a sun shirt, you are reducing the sunscreen load by 50%. That's a major conservation victory.\"\n\nAnother approach would be to use mineral-based sunscreen, such as non-nanosized titanium oxide or zinc oxide.\n\nHow are sunscreen manufacturers reacting?\n\nMany of the larger corporations are against a ban on sunscreen products, saying that the evidence of a detrimental impact on coral is not strong enough.\n\n\"The big boys are fighting it. Johnson & Johnson and L'Oreal don't seem to be on board,\" said Dr Downs.\n\n\"But much of the rest of the industry have already come out with what they are calling 'Hawaii-compliant sunscreen', and it is a big marketing boost for them.\"\n\nA group of manufacturers have formed what they call the Safe Sunscreen Council. They welcomed the move.\n\n\"Palau's move to ban ingredients that have been know to cause damage to coral reefs is the right things to do,\" said Caroline Duell from the council.\n\n\"Hopefully, by Palau taking leadership on this issue, not only will they protect their sacred and economically key coral reef network, but they will show the world that it's time to change the way we think. There are many alternatives for sunscreen and personal care products that are safe, effective and enjoyable to use.\""

    "text": "Image copyright CARL DE SOUZA Image caption Rhino horn is highly prized in traditional Chinese medicine\n\nAnimal conservationists are alarmed over China's decision to partially reverse a ban on the trade of tiger bones and rhino horn.\n\nRhinos and tigers are both endangered in the wild and China prohibited their trade in 1993.\n\nBut on Monday it said parts from captive animals would be authorised for scientific, medical and cultural use.\n\nExperts worry this will increase demand for the animals and jeopardise efforts to protect them.\n\nRhino and tiger parts are highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine. They are prescribed to treat a large variety of ailments including fever, gout, insomnia and meningitis, though any benefits have not been proven.\n\n'Devastating consequences'\n\nIn a statement announcing the replacement of the 25-year old ban, the State Council said powdered forms of rhino horn and bones from dead tigers could be used in \"qualified hospitals by qualified doctors\".\n\nThe animal products can only be obtained from farms, it said.\n\nParts from those animals classified as \"antiques\" could be used in cultural exchanges if approved by the cultural authorities, the statement adds.\n\nThe World Wildlife Fund (WWF) said in a statement that the move would have \"devastating consequences\" and be an \"enormous setback\" to efforts to protect the animals in the wild.\n\n\"Even if restricted to antiques and use in hospitals, this trade would increase confusion by consumers and law enforcers as to which products are and are not legal, and would likely expand the markets for other tiger and rhino products,\" WWF said.\n\nRachel Nuwer, author of the book Poached: Inside The Dark World of Wildlife Trafficking, said on Twitter this could mean \"game over\" for the remaining tigers and rhinos in the world.\n\nShe argued that trade in legal endangered species products provides cover for parts from animals that have been illegally killed."

    "authors": [
      "Dr Michael Mosley"
    ],
    "text": "Image caption Dr Yeo tried the vegan diet for a month\n\nThere has been an explosion in interest in veganism, in recent years, driven largely by concerns about health, animal welfare and the environment.\n\nVegans, for the uninitiated, do not eat meat, poultry, fish, or any products derived from animals, including eggs, dairy products, and gelatin.\n\nThere are now four times as many vegans in the UK as there were four years ago.\n\nSo how hard is it to convert, and what are the potential health benefits?\n\nVeganism: Why is it on the up?\n\nWhy I gave up being vegan\n\nGoing vegan: Is it just a fad?\n\nWhat does a healthy vegan diet look like?\n\nFor the latest series of Trust Me I'm A Doctor, Dr Giles Yeo decided to try it for a month and see if it was a lifestyle he could imagine adopting.\n\nAs Dr Yeo quickly discovered, one of the tricky things about going vegan is that many products that don't sound as if they have anything to do with animals actually do.\n\nEggs, cheese and meat are obvious no-nos but so is mayonnaise (contains eggs), some pastas (ditto), and wine (some alcoholic drinks use fish bones or proteins from other animals as part of the production process).\n\nAs well as making sure you are not accidentally consuming animal products, one of the main challenges of going vegan is to make sure you're not missing out on any key nutrients.\n\nFollowing a vegan diet puts you at risk of getting insufficient vitamin D, which is needed for bone health.\n\nTo get this through diet, vegans may need to rely on fortified foods, including some types of soy milk, rice milk, organic orange juice, and breakfast cereals.\n\nYou may also want to consider taking a vitamin D supplement.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Seaweed is a good source of iodine\n\nIodine deficiency is very common in the UK, particularly among young women.\n\nCow's milk is our main source of iodine and non-dairy alternatives, such as almond milk, have much lower levels. You can get iodine from seaweed (though the amounts are unpredictable) but you will probably need to take a supplement.\n\nThe other big concern is getting enough vitamin B12. You won't find it in seeds, nuts or vegetables, so vegans and vegetarians will need to stock up with fortified breakfast cereal or nutritional yeast.\n\nDoes it work?\n\nWill going vegan make you healthier?\n\nA recent analysis, which pulled together the results of 10 previous studies comparing the health of vegetarian and vegans against that of omnivores, suggests it will.\n\nThe researchers found being a vegetarian or vegan was associated with a significantly lower risk of heart disease and cancer, though there was no difference in all-cause mortality.\n\nIn other words, being a vegetarian or vegan was associated with being healthier but not necessarily with living longer.\n\nI say \"associated with\" because these were not the gold standard randomised controlled studies, where you take a large group of people and randomly allocate them to being vegan or omnivorous and see what happens. Such studies would be very hard to do.\n\nInstead, they compare people who are vegans with meat eaters and look for differences.\n\nSince vegans are likely to be more health conscious than the general population, it is possible that the health differences have nothing to do with the diet itself.\n\nSo how did Dr Yeo get on? After being vegan for a month he had lost 4kg and brought in his belt by a notch. Along with the fall in his belly fat, his cholesterol also fell by 12%.\n\nSo will he keep it up? \"I've been pleasantly surprised,\" he said, \"and though I don't plan to go vegan entirely, from now on I'll try and do at least a few days every month.\n\n\"I have to admit I was apprehensive about going vegan for a month, but once I learned a few recipes I was fine and I actually ended up enjoying it. For me, the key was not to cook vegan versions of meals that I would normally eat with meat, but to opt for recipes that were designed to be vegan in the first place.\n\n\"What I missed most while on the diet was eggs - I actually expected to miss meat a lot more.\"\n\nIf you want to find out more about the benefits and risks of going vegan visit Trust Me I'm A Doctor."

    "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Is your food destroying Brazil's savanna?\n\n\"Exploding human consumption\" has caused a massive drop in global wildlife populations in recent decades, the WWF conservation group says.\n\nIn a report, the charity says losses in vertebrate species - mammals, fish, birds, amphibians and reptiles - averaged 60% between 1970 and 2014.\n\n\"Earth is losing biodiversity at a rate seen only during mass extinctions,\" the WWF's Living Planet Report adds.\n\nIt urges policy makers to set new targets for sustainable development.\n\nThe Living Planet Report, published every two years, aims to assess the state of the world's wildlife.\n\nThe 2018 edition says only a quarter of the world's land area is now free from the impact of human activity and the proportion will have fallen to just a 10th by 2050.\n\nThe change is being driven by ever-rising food production and increased demand for energy, land and water.\n\nAlthough forest loss has been slowed by reforestation in some regions in recent decades, the loss has \"accelerated in tropical forests that contain some of the highest levels of biodiversity on Earth\", the report notes.\n\nIt says South and Central America suffered the most dramatic decline in vertebrate populations - an 89% loss in vertebrate populations compared with 1970.\n\nMarine freshwater species are particularly at risk, the report says. Plastic pollution has been detected in the deepest parts of the word's oceans, including the bottom of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific.\n\nFreshwater species - living in lakes, rivers and wetlands - have seen an 83% decline in numbers since since 1970, according to the report.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Truth Behind My Fried Chicken\n\nThe WWF calls for \"a new global deal for nature and people\" similar to the 2015 Paris agreement to tackle climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\"Decision makers at every level need to make the right political, financial and consumer choices to achieve the vision that humanity and nature thrive in harmony on our only planet,\" the report says.\n\nThe data, gathered from peer-reviewed studies, covers more than 16,700 populations belonging to 4,000 species around the world.\n\nThe WWF's methodology has been criticised. One conservationist told the BBC in 2016 that the data in the 2016 report was skewed towards western Europe, where figures were more readily available.\n\nWhat the numbers show\n\nBy Robert Cuffe, Head of Statistics, BBC News\n\nThis report shows that many species are dwindling at an alarming rate. But it doesn't tell us that we've lost 60% of our wildlife.\n\nThe Living Planet Index looks at the falls in each species, rather than in the total wildlife population.\n\nA huge percentage fall in a rare species will not make much difference to the total number of animals in the world. But it will make a difference to the average fall.\n\nImagine there were only two species in the world: frogs and pandas. Say that fecund frogs, whose numbers remain in the millions, see zero fall. The poor, prudish pandas whose shyness has seen their number drop from 100 to only 20 see an 80% fall.\n\nOn average, there would be an average fall in the populations of species of 40%. But the total population of animals would not be much changed.\n\nThe former is what the Living Planet Index tells us about: how much individual species are growing or shrinking.\n\nBut that is not the same as stripping 40% (or 60%) of wildlife from the planet."

Reactions were priceless.\"\n\nAnother said: \"My mum is a double amputee and when older trick or treaters come she has me pull her prosthetic arm off and run around with it.\"\n\nApril said that she has reached a \"peaceful medium\" where she has accepted her body and wants to \"find every way to take advantage of it\".\n\nWhile many people applauded her creativity and attitude, some pointed out that those with disabilities face real barriers which cannot be overcome with positivity alone.\n\n'Legitimate limitations'\n\nOne Reddit user wrote: \"A plucky attitude is not going to make up for a lack of wheelchair ramps. It's true that a defeatist attitude can be your undoing, but there are legitimate limitations and challenges that don't care whether or not you 'let them be'\".\n\nFormer Paralympian Josh Sundquist describes himself as a \"Halloween enthusiast\" and has created a number of amazing costumes which celebrate his physique.\n\nThis year the US stand-up comedian dressed up as the genie from Aladdin, inspired by Disney animator Broose Johnson, who has two prosthetic legs.\n\nJosh was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer when he was nine and subsequently had his left leg amputated.\n\nJosh told the BBC that as a teen he wore a prosthesis everyday: \"I didn't want people to know I had one leg,\" he said.\n\n\"It takes a long time to make the psychological adjustment to be comfortable with your body after an amputation.\"\n\nIt was this acceptance of his body that enabled him to make his costumes.\n\nHe said: \"Without embracing the way my body is, it would be impossible.\"\n\nYou may also like:\n\nThe unveiling of his Halloween costumes have become eagerly awaited events for his fans, with his latest costume garnering cheers of \"awesome\", \"amazing\" and \"so creative\".\n\nJosh says that he shares his creations to \"interrupt people's day with something that might delight them\".\n\nIn 2013, John decided to mix his creativity with his seemingly impressive upper-body strength to dress as a flamingo.\n\nToni, 28, from Kent, UK, lost her eye a few years ago to cancer.\n\nShe shared an image of herself dressed as Carl Grimes, a character who loses his eye in the zombie-apocalypse show The Walking Dead.\n\nShe wrote: \"I think humour helps with the loss [of my eye] as well as knowing I did the right thing getting it removed.\"\n\nImage copyright u/bling-kofaneye Image caption Toni's costume highlights the loss of her eye\n\nToni told the BBC that since losing her eye she has come to \"understand how little our appearance really matters\" and that sharing the photo was a way of confronting people's ideas about appearance.\n\nReferring to her own appearance Toni said she struggles with the representation of disability in the media - \"usually only villains wear eye patches\" - though she said that is slowly changing."

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nIf forced to choose, who should a self-driving car kill in an unavoidable crash?\n\nShould the passengers in the vehicle be sacrificed to save pedestrians? Or should a pedestrian be killed to save a family of four in the vehicle?\n\nTo get closer to an answer - if that were ever possible - researchers from the MIT Media Lab have analysed more than 40 million responses to an experiment they launched in 2014.\n\nTheir Moral Machine has revealed how attitudes differ across the world.\n\nHow did the experiment work?\n\nWeighing up whom a self-driving car should kill is a modern twist on an old ethical dilemma known as the trolley problem.\n\nThe idea was explored in an episode of the NBC series The Good Place, in which ethics professor Chidi is put in control of a runaway tram.\n\nImage copyright NBC/The Good Place Image caption In The Good Place, Chidi must make a moral decision\n\nIf he takes no action, the tram will run over five engineers working on the tracks ahead.\n\nIf he diverts the tram on to a different track he will save the five engineers, but the tram will hit one other engineer who would otherwise have survived.\n\nThe Moral Machine presented several variations of this dilemma involving a self-driving car.\n\nImage copyright MIT Media Lab Image caption Moral Machine: Should a self-driving car save passengers or pedestrians?\n\nPeople were presented with several scenarios. Should a self-driving car sacrifice its passengers or swerve to hit:\n\na successful business person?\n\na known criminal?\n\na group of elderly people?\n\na herd of cows?\n\npedestrians who were crossing the road when they were told to wait?\n\nFour years after launching the experiment, the researchers have published an analysis of the data in Nature magazine.\n\nWhat did they find?\n\nThe results from 40 million decisions suggested people preferred to save humans rather than animals, spare as many lives as possible, and tended to save young over elderly people.\n\nThere were also smaller trends of saving females over males, saving those of higher status over poorer people, and saving pedestrians rather than passengers.\n\nAbout 490,000 people also completed a demographic survey including their age, gender and religious views. The researchers said these qualities did not have a \"sizeable impact\" on the decisions people made.\n\nThe researchers did find some cultural differences in the decisions people made. People in France were most likely to weigh up the number of people who would be killed, while those in Japan placed the least emphasis on this.\n\nThe researchers acknowledge that their online game was not a controlled study and that it \"could not do justice to all of the complexity of autonomous vehicle dilemmas\".\n\nHowever, they hope the Moral Machine will spark a \"global conversation\" about the moral decisions self-driving vehicles will have to make.\n\n\"Never in the history of humanity have we allowed a machine to autonomously decide who should live and who should die, in a fraction of a second, without real-time supervision. We are going to cross that bridge any time now,\" the team said in its analysis.\n\n\"Before we allow our cars to make ethical decisions, we need to have a global conversation to express our preferences to the companies that will design moral algorithms, and to the policymakers that will regulate them.\"\n\nSkip Twitter post by @spenley If we do ever get to the point where a car really can drive fully autonomously, it will be able to make better split second decisions, based on far more information, and with more precision, than the best human driver ever could. \u2014 Spencer Kelly (@spenley) October 26, 2018 Report\n\nGermany has already introduced a law that states driverless cars must avoid injury or death at all cost.\n\nThe law says algorithms must never decide what to do based on the age, gender or health of the passengers or pedestrians."

    "text": "It\u2019s a busy autumn morning at the Spanish Nursery, a bilingual nursery school in north London. Parents help their toddlers out of cycling helmets and jackets. Teachers greet the children with a cuddle and a chirpy \u201cBuenos dias!\u201d. In the playground, a little girl asks for her hair to be bunched up into a \u201ccoleta\u201d (Spanish for \u2018pigtail\u2019), then rolls a ball and shouts \u201cCatch!\u201d in English.\n\n\u201cAt this age, children don\u2019t learn a language \u2013 they acquire it,\u201d says the school\u2019s director Carmen Rampersad. It seems to sum up the enviable effortlessness of the little polyglots around her. For many of the children, Spanish is a third or even fourth language. Mother tongues include Croatian, Hebrew, Korean and Dutch.\n\nCompare this to the struggle of the average adult in a language class, and it would be easy to conclude that it\u2019s best to start young.\n\nBut science offers a much more complex view of how our relationship with languages evolves over a lifetime \u2013 and there is much to encourage late beginners.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 Why sleep should be every student\u2019s priority\n\n\u2022 The amazing fertility of the older mind\n\n\u2022 Can you lose your native language?\n\nBroadly speaking, different life stages give us different advantages in language learning. As babies, we have a better ear for different sounds; as toddlers, we can pick up native accents with astonishing speed. As adults, we have longer attention spans and crucial skills like literacy that allow us to continually expand our vocabulary, even in our own language.\n\nAnd a wealth of factors beyond ageing \u2013 like social circumstances, teaching methods, and even love and friendship \u2013 can affect how many languages we speak and how well.\n\n\u201cNot everything goes downhill with age,\u201d says Antonella Sorace, a professor of developmental linguistics and director of the Bilingualism Matters Centre at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nShe gives the example of what is known as \u2018explicit learning\u2019: studying a language in a classroom with a teacher explaining the rules. \u201cYoung children are very bad at explicit learning, because they don\u2019t have the cognitive control and the attention and memory capabilities,\u201d Sorace says. \u201cAdults are much better at that. So that can be something that improves with age.\u201d\n\nIn a long-term study of almost Catalan-Spanish bilingual learners of English: the late starters acquired the new language faster than the younger starters\n\nA study by researchers in Israel found, for example, that adults were better at grasping an artificial language rule and applying it to new words in a lab setting. The scientists compared three separate groups: 8-year-olds, 12-year-olds, and young adults. The adults scored higher than both younger groups, and the 12-year-olds also did better than the younger children.\n\nThis chimed with the results of a long-term study of almost 2,000 Catalan-Spanish bilingual learners of English: the late starters acquired the new language faster than the younger starters.\n\nThe researchers in Israel suggested that their older participants may have benefited from skills that come with maturity \u2013 like more advanced problem-solving strategies \u2013 and greater linguistic experience. In other words, older learners tend to already know quite a lot about themselves and the world and can use this knowledge to process new information.\n\nWhat young children excel at is learning implicitly: listening to native speakers and imitating them. But this type of learning requires a lot of time with native speakers. In 2016, the Bilingualism Matters Centre prepared an internal report on Mandarin lessons in primary schools for the Scottish government. They found that one hour a week of teaching did not make a meaningful difference to five-year-olds. But even just one additional half-hour, and the presence of a native speaker, helped the children grasp elements of Mandarin that are harder for adults, such as the tones.\n\nEasy acquisition\n\nWe all start out as natural linguists.\n\nInfants already babble in their mother tongue\n\nAs babies, we can hear all of the 600 consonants and 200 vowels that make up the world\u2019s languages. Within our first year, our brains begin to specialise, tuning into the sounds we hear most frequently. Infants already babble in their mother tongue. Even newborns cry with an accent, imitating the speech they heard while in the womb. This specialisation also means shedding the skills we do not need. Japanese babies can easily distinguish between \u2018l\u2019 and \u2018r\u2019 sounds. Japanese adults tend to find this more difficult.\n\nThere is no question, Sorace says, that the early years are crucial for acquiring our own language. Studies of abandoned or isolated children have shown that if we do not learn human speech early on, we cannot easily make up for this later.\n\nBut here is the surprise: that cut-off is not the same for foreign language learning.\n\n\u201cThe important thing to understand is that age co-varies with many other things,\u201d says Danijela Trenkic, a psycholinguist at the University of York. Children\u2019s lives are completely different from those of adults. So when we compare the language skills of children and adults, Trenkic says, \u201cwe\u2019re not comparing like with like\u201d.\n\nShe gives the example of a family moving to a new country. Typically, children will learn the language much faster than their parents. But that may be because they hear it constantly at school, while their parents might be working alone. The children may also feel a greater sense of urgency since mastering the language is crucial to their social survival: making friends, being accepted, fitting in. Their parents, on the other hand, are more likely to be able to socialise with people who understand them, such as fellow immigrants.\n\nThe emotional bond is what makes you better at language learning \u2013 Danijela Trenkic\n\n\u201cCreating the emotional bond is what makes you better at language learning, in my view,\u201d says Trenkic.\n\nAdults can of course also create that emotional bond, and not just through love or friendship with a native speaker. A 2013 study of British adults in an Italian beginners\u2019 course found that those who stuck with it were helped by bonding with the other students and the teacher.\n\n\u201cIf you find like-minded people, that makes it more likely that you\u2019ll push on with a language, and that you\u2019ll persevere,\u201d Trenkic says. \u201cAnd that really is the key. You need to spend years learning it. Unless there\u2019s a social motivation for it, it\u2019s really difficult to sustain.\u201d\n\nEven native speakers learn almost one new word a day in their own language until middle age\n\nEarlier this year, a study at MIT based on an online quiz of nearly 670,000 people found that to achieve native-like knowledge of English grammar, it is best to start by about 10 years old, after which that ability declines. However, the study also showed that we can keep getting better at languages, including our own, over time. For example, we only fully master the grammar of our own language by about 30. This adds to a previous, separate online study that shows even native speakers learn almost one new word a day in their own language until middle age.\n\nTrenkic points out that the MIT study analysed something extremely specific \u2013 the ability to pass for a native speaker in terms of grammatical accuracy. To the average language student, that may not be all that relevant.\n\n\u201cPeople sometimes ask, what is the biggest advantage of foreign languages? Will I earn more money? Will I be cleverer? Will I stay healthier? But actually, the biggest advantage of knowing foreign languages is being able to communicate with more people,\u201d she says.\n\nTrenkic herself is originally from Serbia. She only became fluent in English in her twenties, after she moved to the UK. She says she still makes grammatical mistakes, especially when she is tired or stressed. \u201cYet, despite all that \u2013 and this is crucial \u2013 I can do amazing things in English,\u201d she later writes in an email. \u201cI can enjoy the greatest literary works, I can produce meaningful and coherent texts of publishable quality.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the MIT quiz classified her as a native English speaker.\n\nAt the Spanish Nursery, where the teachers are singing \u2018Cumpleanos feliz\u2019 and the book corner stocks The Gruffalo in Hebrew, the director herself turns out to be a late starter. Carmen Rampersad grew up in Romania and only really mastered English when she moved abroad in her twenties. Her children absorbed Spanish at nursery.\n\nBut perhaps the most adventurous linguist is her husband. Originally from Trinidad, he learned Romanian from her family, who live close to the border with Moldova.\n\n\u201cHis Romanian is excellent,\u201d she says. \u201cHe speaks it with a Moldavian accent. It\u2019s hilarious.\u201d\n\nJoin 800,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "text": "What do animals do in the fall?\n\nThe autumn skies might be full of migrating birds, but much of Britain\u2019s wildlife will be slowing down after a hot and hectic summer. But despite the shortening days, a handful of species are clocking in some serious overtime.\n\nFirst up, meet the mammals that embrace the romance - and drama - of the season.\n\nRed deer\n\nRed deer are the largest land mammals in the UK and are possibly best known for their breeding behaviour which occurs from the end of September to November. Known as the rut, it is a hormone-charged time as males compete for dominance and mating access to hinds (females). Stags roar, walk in parallel and shove one another with their outsized antlers. The powerful blows dealt can result in injury and death while success in battle requires further exertion to mate with harems numbering as many as 20 females.\n\nThe deer are early risers - much of the activity takes place around dawn - but fights can persist throughout the day and after dark. Even when exhausted, the males must keep their wits about them as subordinates can sneakily mount hinds that are left unattended.\n\nIt\u2019s not just males that are busy, researchers have found that some female fallow deer mate with multiple bucks throughout their rutting season. Scientists from Queen Mary University, London, theorise that this polyandry works as a type of insurance for females. If the dominant buck is older or has a large harem his sperm may be depleted, so females could improve their chances of becoming pregnant by mating more than once in a season.\n\nA Red deer stag with a hind during rutting season \u00a9 Dgwildlife/Getty\n\nGrey seals\n\nMeanwhile, female grey seals are braving stormy seas to bring new life into the world. After a summer gorging on rich fish stocks, the pregnant pinnipeds travel to northern and western rocky shorelines to give birth to their young. The weather here might be wild, but the mothers are in great shape to suckle their young \u2013 feeding them on rich milk to supercharge their development. Yet after only 2-3 weeks, the pups are abruptly weaned and left to their fates by mothers who are ready to mate again.\n\nBull seals come to shore in anticipation of the females entering oestrus (their fertile period) but can become a nuisance to the fresh, still fluffy pups. Similarly to the deer, male seals fight for dominance in aggressive tussles - so pups must contend with adults making love and war.\n\nA newly born Grey Seal pup and its mother lying on the beach being playful with each other \u00a9 Sandra Standbridge/Getty\n\nFish\n\nIt\u2019s not just mammals with reproductive urges in autumn, it\u2019s spawning time for fish species such as sea trout and Atlantic salmon. Both species start to return from the sea and swim upstream to their birthplaces during the summer. Early arrivals will wait in deep pools until it is time to breed, while late comers must battle the additional obstacles thrown up by autumn flood waters. Salmon are famous for leaping up weirs and waterfalls to get to their spawning sites and provide quite a seasonal spectacle. In October and November, females lay their eggs in \u201credds\u201d scraped on the gravelly river bed and males fertilise them. Sea trout and salmon rarely feed in freshwater so they must rely on their reserves for the return journey back to the sea.\n\nA leaping salmon at Shin Falls, Scotland \u00a9 Catherine Clark/Getty\n\nInsects\n\nMany insect species have already left their legacy in egg form to spring into life next year, and the adults expire as temperatures drop. Daddy long legs, or crane flies, hold out longer and are common sights in September when they seek out places to leave their offspring. But the adults will mostly be swept away by heavier rains in October.\n\nRed green carpet moths, peacock and small tortoiseshell butterflies are on the wing as they seek out suitable shelter \u2013 sometimes in houses. They are among the few moth and butterfly species that \u2018overwinter\u2019 by entering a state of torpor to survive until the warm days of spring. They can be roused early by central heating, in which case they\u2019re best left in a cool sheltered spot to return to their rest.\n\nThe most familiar insect house-hunters in autumn are ladybirds, especially when they settle around window frames by the dozen. While they are usually solitary, the beetles become more sociable and respond positively to the touch of fellow ladybirds in autumn. They will huddle up in large aggregations which increase their chances of surviving the winter. While various native species will be sheltering in leaf litter, harlequins (invasive \u2018newcomers\u2019 to the British Isles from Asia) are less cold-tolerant and attracted to light-coloured surfaces around human homes, thought to mimic the natural rock formations in their native lands. Once they find somewhere suitable for overwintering, they lay down chemical clues to invite more ladybirds to the same site.\n\nLadybirds settle around window frames by the dozen \u00a9 Peter Welke/EyeEm/Getty\n\nGrey squirrels\n\nIn addition to sex and shelter, food is the other key motivating factor behind the rush of autumn activity. Grey squirrels, which spend more time foraging on the ground than their red cousins, will bury thousands of the season\u2019s abundance of nuts to provide a larder through winter. Their caches are scattered throughout woodlands, and scientists have found the animals have excellent spatial memories that help them retrieve their stores. With an estimated 25% of their caches vulnerable to theft by other squirrels and birds, the smart mammals employ sophisticated problem solving skills to protect their snacks. In a balancing act to ensure they don\u2019t expend too much energy, they decide when to eat a nut, store it \u2013 or try to conceal their behaviour from onlookers.\n\nGrey Squirrels bury thousands of the season\u2019s abundance of nuts to provide a larder through winter \u00a9 Sandra Standbridge/Getty\n\nJays\n\nJays exhibit similar sneaky behaviour. These forest relatives of crows can bury as many as 5000 acorns in autumn but prefer to do so by bushes or trees where their activity can be screened from observers. The famously screechy birds, whose scientific name means \u201cbabbler of the acorns\u201d, also make the effort to cache in quieter locations and will vocalize less when there\u2019s a chance to pilfer from another.\n\nJays can bury as many as 5000 acorns in autumn but prefer to do so by bushes or trees where their activity can be screened from observers. \u00a9 Gary Chalker/Getty\n\nNext time you take a relaxing walk through fallen leaves, perhaps spare a thought for the industrious species that have to step it up this season.\n\nBy Ella Davies\n\nFeatured image by Mark Bridger/Getty"

    ],
    "text": "More than 30 million people worldwide suffer from Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2013 the most common form of dementia. Unfortunately, there is no cure, only drugs to ease the symptoms.\n\nHowever, my own research suggests a way to treat the disease. I have found the strongest evidence yet that the herpes virus is a cause of Alzheimer\u2019s, suggesting that effective and safe antiviral drugs might be able to treat the disease. We might even be able to vaccinate our children against it.\n\nThe virus implicated in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), is better known for causing cold sores. It infects most people in infancy and then remains dormant in the peripheral nervous system (the part of the nervous system that isn\u2019t the brain and the spinal cord). Occasionally, if a person is stressed, the virus becomes activated and, in some people, it causes cold sores.\n\nHSV1 enters the brains of elderly people as their immune system declines with age\n\nWe discovered in 1991 that in many elderly people HSV1 is also present in the brain. And in 1997 we showed that it confers a strong risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease when present in the brain of people who have a specific gene known as APOE4.\n\nThe virus can become active in the brain, perhaps repeatedly, and this probably causes cumulative damage. The likelihood of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease is 12 times greater for APOE4 carriers who have HSV1 in the brain than for those with neither factor.\n\nLater, we and others found that HSV1 infection of cell cultures causes beta-amyloid and abnormal tau proteins to accumulate. An accumulation of these proteins in the brain is characteristic of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nWe believe that HSV1 is a major contributory factor for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and that it enters the brains of elderly people as their immune system declines with age. It then establishes a latent (dormant) infection, from which it is reactivated by events such as stress, a reduced immune system and brain inflammation induced by infection by other microbes.\n\nReactivation leads to direct viral damage in infected cells and to viral-induced inflammation. We suggest that repeated activation causes cumulative damage, leading eventually to Alzheimer\u2019s disease in people with the APOE4 gene.\n\nPresumably, in APOE4 carriers, Alzheimer\u2019s disease develops in the brain because of greater HSV1-induced formation of toxic products, or less repair of damage.\n\nNew treatments?\n\nThe data suggest that antiviral agents might be used for treating Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The main antiviral agents, which are safe, prevent new viruses from forming, thereby limiting viral damage.\n\nIn an earlier study, we found that the anti-herpes antiviral drug, acyclovir, blocks HSV1 DNA replication, and reduces levels of beta-amyloid and tau caused by HSV1 infection of cell cultures.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that all studies, including our own, only show an association between the herpes virus and Alzheimer\u2019s \u2013 they don\u2019t prove that the virus is an actual cause. Probably the only way to prove that a microbe is a cause of a disease is to show that an occurrence of the disease is greatly reduced either by targeting the microbe with a specific anti-microbial agent or by specific vaccination against the microbe.\n\nExcitingly, successful prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s disease by use of specific anti-herpes agents has now been demonstrated in a large-scale population study in Taiwan. Hopefully, information in other countries, if available, will yield similar results.\n\n--\n\nRuth Itzhaki is Professor Emeritus of Molecular Neurobiology at University of Manchester.

    "text": "They forgot about one thing though, the environmental cost. A scene in the TV show Mad Men illustrates the mentality of the time. Don Draper and his family go for a picnic and they spread out the tablecloth and they\u2019ve got plastic cutlery and plastic cups they're using. And at the end of the picnic, Don\u2019s wife Betty grabs the picnic blanket and he just shakes it all out onto the grass, wraps up the blanket and walks away. This type of attitude was the beginning of our modern way.\n\nThe answer isn\u2019t to ban plastics, they are massively useful not least in our homes, hospitals and transport systems\n\nAs a result, consumerism did indeed boom, the economy grew, and life became more convenient - who doesn't like to eat a take-away every now and again, especially after a long day at work? But the reputation of plastics suffered. No longer idolised they became a by-word for a throw-away culture. No product symbolised this more than the single-use plastic bag, which was marketed to an initially reluctant public in the 1970s without any thought for what it would do to the environment once thrown away.\n\nYet of course there is no \u2018away\u2019 for plastics to be thrown. Because of their very stable chemical structure plastics do not biodegrade or dissolve in water. These, of course, are the very remarkable properties that make them so special. But once they have been used and then discarded, as they stay in the environment for a hundred years or more, and since the sea is pretty much downhill from everywhere, they tend to end up there.\n\nThe answer isn\u2019t to ban plastics. They are massively useful not least in our homes, hospitals and transport systems. The way forward is for us to engage more with plastics, to build trust in and a love of plastics again. It is only by understanding that they are indispensable, and relearning how to value them, that we will summon the political will to end the era of disposability.\n\nTo find out more about what you can do to reduce your consumption of single use plastics go to the BBC Plastics Action website."

    "text": "The Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky is a master of the post-industrial sublime. His sweeping point of view is, at the very least, ambivalent. His shots, most recently taken from the coolest possible standpoint of a helicopter and sometimes a satellite, are at first sight surreal and glorious, but they have an ominous documentary undertow.\n\nHis large-format photos aestheticise mining, deforestation, industrial waste and decay, monumental piles of garbage, plastic, rubber; expanses of new and decommissioned equipment so vast that they look like crystalline formations; dense human settlements which from an Olympian standpoint look like creeping mould or infestations.\n\n\u201cMost people would walk by a dump pile and assume that there\u2019s no picture there,\u201d Burtynsky has said. \u201cBut there\u2019s always a picture, you just have to go in there and find it.\u201d One of his famous sequences depicts mountains of discarded tires in California. Another shows mountains of poached ivory being burnt. Waves of rock curve into an unsettling symmetry in his photo of Chuquicamata, one of the world\u2019s largest open-pit mines. There is dark irony in his radically anti-idyllic view of the world.\n\nNobel Prize winner Paul Jozef Crutzen has popularised the idea of the Anthropocene, a geological age dominated by human activity. For a new multimedia Anthropocene project, Burtynsky visited 20 countries over five years. He argues that \u201cwe are on the cusp of becoming (if we are not already) the perpetrator of a\u2026 major extinction event\u201d. This is made stark in the unnatural colour of a phosphor tailings pond in Florida: regions where phosphate \u2013 essential to industrial agriculture \u2013 is mined are typically unable to revert back to their natural state because of pollution. \u201cLet me ask you a question,\u201d asked Burtynsky in a 2016 Facebook post: \u201cwhen was the last time you talked or heard or even thought about phosphorus?\u201d\n\n\u201cScientists do a pretty terrible job of telling stories, whereas artists have the ability to take the world and make it accessible for everyone,\u201d argues Burtynsky. According to his new book Anthropocene, it is estimated that it currently takes 60 billion tonnes of material annually (biomass, fossil energy carriers, metal ores, industrial and construction minerals) to feed humanity\u2019s global metabolism. Burtynsky\u2019s images offer a disturbing insight into how we\u2019re consuming the Earth at an alarming rate \u2013 as well as giving a sense of the scale at which we\u2019re dumping it back out, in giant heaps, streams, and lagoons.\n\nIn images like that of the Morenci Mine \u2013 showing copper smelting in Arizona, with ponds holding liquid reserves of the effluents left by the extraction process \u2013 Burtynsky can tell stories that largely remain out of the mainstream, with an immediacy missing from lengthy articles. His aerial shots are graphic reminders of something that many choose to ignore. In Nigeria, poor communities have begun pirating crude oil from the pipelines through a process known as \u2018bunkering\u2019. Makeshift micro-refineries are set up to convert the crude into fuel. These systems leak volumes of crude and toxic by-products into the surrounding forests and waterways.\n\nBurtynsky categorises himself as an environmentalist, and has dedicated his life to bearing witness to \u201cthe indelible marks left by humankind on the geological face of our planet\u201d. In other words, the increasingly ambitious scars and blemishes created by industry and large-scale human habitation, such as the vividly coloured layers from an ancient sea floor exposed by tunnelling machines 350m beneath Berezniki in Russia.\n\nBurtynsky explores how this is not just a recent development, either. The marble quarries in Carrara have been mined since the time of ancient Rome. This stone was famously used by Michelangelo, who would stay for three months at a time to supervise its removal. The \u2018negative architecture\u2019 formed on the land by the quarries is large enough to be seen from space.\n\nBurtynsky\u2019s photos of sprawling wind farms and solar installations, on the other hand, document a shift towards sustainability. Equally, the enormous lithium mining and purification operation he captures in the Atacama desert in Chile, however virulent and lurid it appears, looks to a future in which cars powered by lithium batteries enable us to phase out fossil fuels.\n\nBurtynsky also evidently cherishes the bits of Eden that survive. He has recently photographed tracts of virgin rainforest in British Columbia, Canada, and the pristine coral reefs in Indonesia. The coral wall in Pengah is a rare remnant of our globally diminishing coral reefs. Coral bleaching might be more likely to occur there (as elsewhere, such as on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016) should sea water temperatures begin to rise.\n\nLooking at those pictures makes the soul soar. But they are also a reminder that there is currently no ecology on Earth that isn\u2019t in some way threatened.\n\nBurtynsky\u2019s show The Human Signature runs at Flowers Gallery in London from 17 October to 24 November 2018.\n\nThe exhibition Anthropocene, a multidisciplinary collaboration between Burtynsky, Jennifer Baichwal, and Nicholas de Pencier, runs until 24 February 2019 at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the National Gallery of Canada.\n\nThe book Anthropocene, which accompanies the exhibitions, is published by Steidl."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Two unborn babies have had their spines repaired by surgeons - weeks before they were born.\n\nThe operations - which are the first ever of their kind in the UK - were carried out by a team of 30 doctors at University College Hospital in London.\n\nThe babies had spina bifida, a condition when the spinal cord fails to develop properly and has a gap in it.\n\nIt is usually treated after birth, but the earlier it is repaired the better for long-term health and mobility.\n\nDuring the 90-minute surgery carried out this summer, doctors cut an opening in the womb and then stitched together the baby's gap in the spine.\n\nThe procedure is risky and can cause premature labour, but researchers are exploring less invasive keyhole methods.\n\n\"We put the mum on some drugs that help relax them, but there is still a risk,\" said UCL Professor Anne David, who has worked on bringing the surgery to the UK for three years.\n\nMums and babies are recovering well, the hospital said.\n\nMothers previously had to go abroad to the US, Belgium or Switzerland for the operation.\n\n\"It's fantastic,\" said Prof David. \"Women now don't have to travel out of the UK. They can have their family with them. There are less expenses. So all good things.\"\n\nWhat is spina bifida?\n\nAccording to the charity Shine, more than 200 children are born with spina bifida every year.\n\nThe NHS says the condition happens when the baby's neural tube - an early form of the baby's brain and spinal cord - does not form properly and leads to gaps or defects in the spinal cord and bones of the spine.\n\nSurgery can be used to close the gap in the spine in most cases, but often the nervous system will already have been damaged leading to problems including paralysis of the legs and incontinence. Some people with the condition have learning difficulties.\n\nIt is not known what causes the condition, which develops during pregnancy, but a lack of folic acid can increase the risk.\n\nThe surgery, which follows a trial in the US, will be available for patients through the new Centre for Prenatal Therapy at Great Ormond Street Hospital and UCL hospital.\n\n\"There were some children who had grown up following foetal surgery who were walking and you wouldn't expect them to be walking if they hadn't had it,\" said Prof David, of the recent US study."

    "authors": [
      "David Robson"
    ],
    "text": "Even if you have not been diagnosed with a mental illness, day-to-day stresses can easily drain your life of fulfilment and contentment.\n\nThere is no shortage of evidence-based strategies that can help to pull you out of that rut \u2013 the scientific field of so-called \u2018positive psychology\u2019 is now 20 years old and has provided countless techniques to boost your mood.\n\nBut how do we find the time to apply them in our daily lives? Sandi Mann, a lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire, offers one solution. Building on her experience as a clinical psychologist, she has some suggestions that might help. As she outlines in her book, Ten Minutes to Happiness, her programme takes the form of a daily journal, to be completed in six parts:\n\n1. What experiences, however mundane, gave you pleasure?\n\n2. What praise and feedback did you receive?\n\n3. What were the moments of pure good fortune?\n\n4. What were your achievements, however small?\n\n5. What made you feel grateful?\n\n6. How did you express kindness?\n\nMuch of the programme builds on a vast amount of scientific research showing that taking a little time to reappraise your day in these ways can slowly shift your mindset so that you eventually find more happiness in your life. When we feel low, it can be easy to overlook the things that are going right \u2013 and keeping this journal brings them to the forefront of your attention.\n\nMann stresses that the benefits do not just come from the immediate lift as you write the entries; re-reading your previous entries can help you cope with difficult situations in the future too. Thanks to our \u2018associative\u2019 memory, a dark mood \u2013 caused by one bad event \u2013 may lead you to preferentially remember other sources of stress and unhappiness. Whenever that happens, leafing through the pages of your journal may help you to break out of that ruminative spiral.\n\nThe sixth point builds on recent research into the power of kindness. Various studies have found that selfless acts not only increase the well-being of those around you, they consistently boost your own mood too. Spending a bit of money to help a stranger, for instance, makes you far happier than using the same cash to treat yourself, a finding that has been replicated in more than 130 countries.\n\nFocusing on those occasions should ensure you make the most of those warm feelings while also encouraging you to look for new opportunities the next day. (You can read more about this research in BBC Future\u2019s archive story: Does it pay to be kind to strangers?)\n\nA 10-minute review of your day can\u2019t work miracles, of course \u2013 and Mann stresses that anyone who suspects they may suffer from depression should still see their GP for professional medical care. But for those who generally feel \u2018low\u2019 and stressed, without severe clinical symptoms, this might just help put you back on the right path.\n\nIf you find Mann\u2019s approach interesting, you may also enjoy her counterintuitive research on boredom. In a series of experiments, she has found that short periods of tedium can bring great benefits.\n\nStudents asked to copy out the phone book, for instance, tended to come up with more creative solutions to common brain teasers at a later point, compared with those who were spared the tedium. Mann suspects that the boring activity encourages the students\u2019 minds to wander and daydream, encouraging more flexible thinking in the creative task.\n\n\u201cIf you find yourself stuck on a problem, just take some time out \u2013 to be bored \u2013 and you might find that creative solution pops into your mind,\u201d Mann told BBC Reel. This is particularly important today, when we may always be tempted to turn to social media to occupy our minds. \u201cOne way that we can embrace [this] in your lives is to stop swiping our boredom away,\u201d she added. You can view the video above.\n\nOver time, you might even find that your tolerance increases so periods of waiting that once felt agonising become an opportunity for calm and reflection. \u201cParadoxically, the best way to deal with boredom is to let more of it into your lives.\u201d\n\n--\n\nDavid Robson is a senior journalist at BBC Future.

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Dogs have been going on walkies for a very long time\n\nDogs were part of a key moment in human history - when our ancestors began trying their hand at farming.\n\nAs the first farmers moved out of the Middle East, herding animals such as sheep and goats, dogs tagged along too, say scientists.\n\nThe DNA evidence fills in some of the gaps in the story of how wolves became the dogs of all shapes and sizes that we know today.\n\nFarming began in what is known as the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East.\n\nThis includes parts of modern-day Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel and Egypt.\n\nHumans who were living as hunter-gatherers settled down and started growing wild varieties of crops like wheat, barley, peas and lentils.\n\nThey also domesticated animals from wild sheep, cows and pigs. About 9,000 years ago, they moved into Europe and Asia, taking their animals and farming know-how with them.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A border collie and Czechoslovakian wolf dog in communication\n\nThe new study shows their dogs also went on the trip.\n\nThe evidence comes from DNA extracted from canine remains found at archaeological sites across Europe and Asia.\n\n\"Our study shows that dogs and humans have an intertwined story - dogs followed humans during this migration across Europe,\" said Dr Morgane Ollivier of the University of Rennes in France.\n\n\"We show in this paper that dogs and humans were already really connected.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Wolves in Norwegian winter forest\n\nThe journey from wolves to dogs\n\nThe story of how dogs came to be tamed from wolves is a complex one\n\nDogs evolved from wolves about 20,000 to 40,000 years ago when they were tamed by human hunter-gatherers\n\nThey may have been tamed from two different populations of wolves living thousands of miles apart\n\nThe long process of domestication began to alter the behaviour and genes of wolves and they eventually evolved into the dogs that we know today.\n\nWhen the dogs arrived in Europe, they mixed with the dogs that were already there, changing the gene pool.\n\nCenturies of dog breeding have mixed up the genes of dogs further. Modern dogs, of all shapes and sizes, are very different now to those early farm dogs who accompanied their owners on their travels.\n\nThe research is published in the journal Biology Letters.\n\nFollow Helen on Twitter."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ocean plastic is often eaten by sea animals, with fatal results\n\nThe European Parliament has voted for a complete ban on a range of single-use plastics across the union in a bid to stop pollution of the oceans.\n\nMEPs backed a ban on plastic cutlery and plates, cotton buds, straws, drink-stirrers and balloon sticks.\n\nThe proposal also calls for a reduction in single-use plastic for food and drink containers like plastic cups.\n\nOne MEP said, if no action was taken, \"by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the oceans\".\n\nThe European Commission proposed a ban in May, following a surge in public support attributed to documentaries such as David Attenborough's BBC Blue Planet series.\n\nThe measure still has to clear some procedural hurdles, but is expected to go through. The EU hopes it will go into effect across the bloc by 2021.\n\nThe UK will also have to incorporate the rules into national law if the ban becomes a fully-fledged directive before the end of a Brexit transition period.\n\nAfter the Parliament vote was backed by 571-53, the MEP responsible for the bill, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Ries, said it was \"a victory for our oceans, for the environment and for future generations.\"\n\nSeveral countries are already considering proposals to target disposable plastic products - including the UK.\n\nWhat's being banned?\n\nThe directive targets some of the most common ocean-polluting plastics.\n\nThe list of banned items such as cutlery and cotton buds was chosen because there are readily available alternatives, such as paper straws and cardboard containers.\n\nOther items, \"where no alternative exists\" will still have to be reduced by 25% in each country by 2025. Examples given include burger boxes and sandwich wrappers.\n\nMEPs also tacked on amendments to the plans for cigarette filters, a plastic pollutant that is common litter on beaches. Cigarette makers will have to reduce the plastic by 50% by 2025 and 80% by 2030.\n\nAnother ambitious target is to ensure 90% of all plastic drinks bottles are collected for recycling by 2025. Currently, bottles and their lids account for about 20% of all the sea plastic, the European Parliament report said.\n\nManufacturers will also have to take more responsibility for what happens to their plastic products and packaging.\n\nHow big is the problem?\n\nThe EU's research on the topic says about 150,000 tonnes of plastic are tossed into European waters every year.\n\nThat is only a small contributor to the global problem, with an estimated eight million tonnes of plastic entering the world's oceans annually. And once there, plastic can travel great distances on ocean currents.\n\nThose plastics have a huge effect on marine life.\n\nFish and large aquatic mammals can be killed by the pollution. Whales can eat plastic bags, making it impossible for them to eat real food which can eventually lead to death.\n\nWhen plastic debris breaks down from wear and tear, it does not decompose the way other products like wood do - but instead breaks down into smaller and smaller pieces, becoming \"microplastic\".\n\nThese tiny fragments often end up in fish and can then be passed on to humans.\n\nLarge volumes of plastic waste wash up on beaches, where they can be eaten by sea birds and other animals and kill them."

Lying more than 2,000m below the surface, it is also beyond the reach of modern divers.\n\n\"It's preserved, it's safe,\" she added. \"It's not deteriorating and it's unlikely to attract hunters.\"\n\nThe vessel was one of many tracking between the Mediterranean and Greek colonies on the Black Sea coast. It was discovered more than 80km off the Bulgarian city of Burgas.\n\nImage copyright Werner Forman/Getty Images Image caption The Anglo-Bulgarian team believe the Black Sea wreck dates back to the Fourth Century BC, perhaps 100 years after the Siren Vase was painted\n\nThe team used two underwater robotic explorers to map out a 3-D image of the ship and they took a sample to carbon-date its age.\n\nThe vessel is similar in style to that depicted by the so-called Siren Painter on the Siren Vase in the British Museum. Dating back to around 480 BC, the vase shows Odysseus strapped to the mast as his ship sails past three mythical sea nymphs whose tune was thought to drive sailors to their deaths.\n\nAs yet the ship's cargo remains unknown and the team say they need more funding if they are to return to the site. \"Normally we find amphorae (wine vases) and can guess where it's come from, but with this it's still in the hold,\" said Dr Farr.\n\n\"As archaeologists we're interested in what it can tell us about technology, trade and movements in the area.\"\n\nOver the course of three years the academic expedition found 67 wrecks including Roman trading ships and a 17th Century Cossack trading fleet."

What are they looking at, and what are they thinking?\n\nIt turns out they are watching a big barney between members of their troop.\n\nThis image of apparent serenity versus commotion is the overall winner of the 2018 Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition, announced at a gala dinner at London's Natural History Museum.\n\nThe picture was taken by Marsel van Oosten in China's Qinling Mountains.\n\nThe Dutchman had to follow the troop for many days to understand the animals' dynamics and predict their behaviour. His goal was to show in one shot the beautiful hair on a male snub-nosed monkey's back, and the creature's blue face.\n\nMarsel's perseverance eventually paid off with this exquisite composition that includes a smaller female behind.\n\nThe photographer told BBC News he was \"shocked and honoured\" to receive the award. \"I am happy that it is with this particular image because it is an endangered species and one that very few people even know exists and it is important that we realise that there are a lot of species on this planet that are under threat.\n\n\"It is not only rhinos, tigers and polar bears; and these kind of species deserve a lot more attention and all the protection they can get.\"\n\nThe image is not showy or shocking as WPY winners sometimes are. But there is something enthralling there that pulls you in, says Roz Kidman Cox, the chair of the competition's judges.\n\n\"As we were going through the entries, we just kept coming back to this one,\" she recalls. \"It's almost like a stage set. I think what makes it are the colours and the lighting.\n\n\"These monkeys normally feed in the trees, but somehow Marsel's managed to catch them on the ground, and he's carefully thrown a very gentle flash on to the scene to illuminate that amazing fur.\"\n\nLounging leopard by Skye Meaker\n\nImage copyright Skye Meaker / WPY\n\nThe junior winner this year is Skye Meaker from South Africa for his picture of a dozy leopard in Botswana's Mashatu Game Reserve.\n\nThe animal is well known and goes by the name of Mathoja, which in the Bantu language means \"the one that walks with a limp\". The leopard broke a leg as a juvenile.\n\nIt survives but has to fight hard because unlike other big cats it cannot pull dead prey into the trees to eat it, says Skye. That means eating on the ground where hyenas are always trying to pinch a kill.\n\n\"We waited several hours to get this shot. I wanted Mathoja's eyes to be open, and just for a couple of minutes that's what happened. Mathoja looked straight at us.\"\n\nAs well as his grand title, 16-year-old Skye wins the 15-17 Years Old category.\n\nHe has a big future, believes Kidman Cox: \"I've had enough of leopards on a log; it's a cliche. But Skye has something different here. I think again it's to do with the light; the dappled green in the background. And then there's the expression on the leopard's face.\"\n\nHere are some other section winners:\n\nPipe owls by Arshdeep Singh\n\nImage copyright Arshdeep Singh / WPY\n\n10 Years And Under category - This shot is taken by another youngster, Arshdeep Singh. He won his section for this photo taken just outside Kapurthala, a city in the Indian state of Punjab. He says: \"I saw the owls fly in the tube and I told my dad. He said that's not possible, but he stopped the car. We had to wait 20 or 30 minutes until they came out again, and then I took the picture.\"\n\nBed of seals by Cristobal Serrano\n\nImage copyright Cristobal Serrano / WPY\n\nAnimals In Their Environment category - Cristobal Serrano from Spain took this shot of crabeater seals resting on an ice floe off the Antarctic Peninsula. The seals have a close relationship with the sea-ice because it is the habitat that provides shelter and food (algae) for krill, tiny crustaceans. And it is the krill that are the main food source for the seals.\n\nMud-rolling mud-dauber by Georgina Steytler\n\nImage copyright Georgina Steytler / WPY\n\nBehaviour: Invertebrates category - Georgina Steytler took this picture of mud-dauber wasps in Walyormouring Nature Reserve in Western Australia by getting down to their level. In the mud. \"I just got down in it with a long lens, taking shot after shot. I wanted to get one of the wasps carrying a mud ball, and to get two was incredible. It's luck but you have to be in the right place at the right time with the right equipment.\" The wasps use the balls to build nest chambers where they lay eggs on the paralysed bodies of spiders.\n\nNight flight by Michael Patrick O'Neill\n\nImage copyright Michael Patrick O'Neill / WPY\n\nUnderwater category - This is a flying fish captured in the lens of American photographer Michael Patrick O'Neill. It was taken during a night dive off Florida's Palm Beach. These fish are very timid during the day but at night are easier to approach. Michael tried various camera and light settings to get this other worldly impression of the animal.\n\nThe sad clown by Joan de la Malla\n\nImage copyright Joan de la Malla / WPY\n\nWildlife Photojournalism category - This shocking image of a street monkey was taken by Joan de la Malla on the island of Java, Indonesia. It is a macaque that has been forced to wear a clown's mask. \"It is painful and the macaque has its hand up to try to remove it,\" says Joan. The Spanish photographer has been working with animal welfare groups to try to get this type of street performance shut down. In the last couple of weeks, this has happened; and this particular animal, known as Timbul, is heading back to the wild.\n\nMother defender by Javier Aznar Gonz\u00e1lez de Rueda\n\nImage copyright Javier Aznar Gonz\u00e1lez de Rueda / WPY\n\nWildlife Photographer Portfolio category - Javier Aznar Gonz\u00e1lez de Rueda, another Spanish photographer, entered a series of images, with this one featuring the Alchisme treehopper. The picture, taken in the El Jard\u00edn de los Sue\u00f1os reserve in Ecuador, shows a mother guarding her nymphs. A treehopper will lay her eggs on the underside of a nightshade leaf and then cover them with a thin secretion. Once the eggs hatch, they develop through five nymphal stages, differing in size, colour and ornamentation.\n\nHellbent by David Herasimtschuk\n\nImage copyright David Herasimtschuk / WPY\n\nBehaviour, Amphibians and Reptiles category - A Hellbender salamander holds a northern water snake in its jaws in this photo taken in Tennessee's Tellico River. David Herasimtschuk says the snake eventually managed to escape after wrestling with North America's largest aquatic salamander.\n\nWindsweep by Orlando Fernandez Miranda\n\nImage copyright Orlando Fernandez Miranda / WPY\n\nEarth's Environments category - The top of a high dune on Namibia's desert Skeleton Coast, where mounds of wind-sculpted sand merge with crashing Atlantic waves. Look closer and you will see the fog that often forms in this region of Africa. As the fog drifts inland it delivers life-sustaining moisture to plants and insects.\n\nWPY is one of the most prestigious competitions of its type in world photography.\n\nStarted in 1964, the competition is now organised by London's Natural History Museum.\n\nAn exhibition of the best images opens at the South Kensington institution on Friday.

But MPs have criticised the system for being open to fraud.\n\nAs first reported by the Guardian, allegations the Environment Agency (EA) is understood to be investigating include:\n\nExporters are illegally claiming for tens of thousands of tonnes of plastic waste which might not exist\n\nPlastic waste is not being recycled and is being left to leak into rivers and oceans\n\nUK firms accused of shipping contaminated waste - when non-recyclable items are mixed in with recyclables items - are being allowed to continue exporting.\n\nAccording to the Guardian, data passed to the EA shows a huge difference between the amount of packaging exports recorded by HM Customs, compared with the amount UK exporters claim to have shipped.\n\nThe newspaper, which analysed the data, said British exporters claimed to have exported 35,135 tonnes more plastic than HM Customs recorded.\n\n'Fraudsters and criminals'\n\nIt also reported that six UK exporters of plastic waste have had their licences suspended or cancelled in the last three months. One had had 57 containers of plastic waste stopped at UK ports over the last three years due to concerns over contamination.\n\nThe UK plastic waste export industry is said to be worth \u00a350m year.\n\nAn EA spokesman did not comment on specific claims, but said: \"Waste crime damages lives, livelihoods and the environment.\n\n\"We have a specialist central investigative team and dedicated staff up and down the country who tackle it. We take seriously all allegations of fraud and... will bring fraudsters and criminals to justice.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Councils are cutting back their plastic recycling services.\n\nA National Audit Office inquiry earlier this year warned that the current system was open to abuse and was not being monitored properly.\n\nIt said that the financial incentive for companies to fraudulently claim they had recycled plastic packaging was \"higher than for any other material\".\n\n\"There is therefore a risk that some of it is not recycled under equivalent standards to the UK and is instead sent to landfill or contributes to pollution,\" it said.\n\nOn top of that, this year, five export firms flagged as high risk are still operating and 33 considered to be of medium risk are also still accredited to export waste.\n\nQuick quiz\n\nIt comes after China and Vietnam have stopped importing foreign plastic waste amid concerns about high contamination levels.\n\nThis has had a knock-on effect on UK local authorities, many of which have cut their plastic recycling services amid a build-up of waste.\n\nBasingstoke and Deane Borough Council has told residents to recycle only plastic bottles, leaving all other plastics in normal rubbish bins.\n\nAnd Swindon Borough Council has told residents to put mixed plastic waste, such as yoghurt pots, into their regular bins so it can be incinerated and turned into fuel.\n\nIt said the main benefit of the temporary measure was \"to prevent the risk of it ending up in overseas landfill or worse\"."

But a small team tasked with destroying it in 1942 failed.\n\nThe following year, Ronneberg chose a team of five other commandos in an Allied operation codenamed Gunnerside.\n\n\"We were a gang of friends doing a job together,\" he told the BBC during the 70th anniversary of the mission.\n\nThe men parachuted on to a plateau, skied across country, descended into a ravine and crossed an icy river before using the railway line to get into the plant and set their explosives.\n\n\"We very often thought that this was a one way trip,\" he said.\n\nImage caption Ronneberg remembered his friends and fellow fighters at a memorial of their operation in London in 2013\n\nAfter the explosion, the men escaped into neighbouring Sweden by skiing 320km (200 miles) across Telemark - despite being chased by some 3,000 German soldiers.\n\nWith a wry smile, Ronneberg described it as \"the best skiing weekend I ever had\".\n\nThe operation, coupled with US air raids the following year, led the Germans to abandon their plans and was later described as the most successful act of sabotage of World War Two.\n\nRonneberg was reluctant to talk about his experience despite numerous books, documentaries and TV series retelling the story.\n\nHe broke his silence in the 1970s, when he began raising awareness of the dangers of war among young people.\n\n\"Those growing up today need to understand that we must always be ready to fight for peace and freedom,\" he said."

    "text": "Among many monogamous species, from cockatiels to cichlid fish, studies have revealed a clear pattern: it helps to be more similar to your mate. When mating pairs are behaviourally similar, their reproductive success tends to be higher.\n\nIn human terms, this would imply it\u2019s better to be similar to your partner. Indeed, for a long time psychologists and others have argued that similarity is probably beneficial \u2013 after all, then we will be more likely to enjoy the same pursuits, values and outlook on life.\n\nBut no matter how intuitive the idea seems, for decades nearly every study has failed to support it.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 How marriage changes people forever\n\n\u2022 Are other people\u2019s sex lives better than yours?\n\n\u2022 Why you don\u2019t really have a \u2018type\u2019\n\nNow, though, a team of psychologists at the University of Amsterdam think they know why. They\u2019ve taken a far more sophisticated and nuanced look at the issue than in previous research. Their findings suggest that partner similarity does actually matter \u2013 especially for the trait of \u2018agreeableness\u2019.\n\nTheir study is not alone. Other recent research looking at factors besides personality has found similarity is important in other ways, like whether you\u2019re a morning person and if you share political attitudes. But above all \u2013 and perhaps more important than how similar you are \u2013 is how much you each come to develop a sense of a shared identity.\n\nIn terms of how much similarity affects relationships, lead researcher Manon van Scheppingen and her colleagues explain that virtually all previous research has taken an all-or-nothing approach, without factoring in the more nuanced question of whether the effect depends on the specific traits you are talking about and the relative score each partner has on those traits.\n\nTo take one example, common sense would suggest that if both partners are highly conscientiousness, then similarity in that case might well be beneficial. But if one partner has very low conscientiousness, it may actually be better for the relationship if the other partner differs from them and has more conscientiousness \u2013 leading to a kind of beneficial compensation effect.\n\nVan Scheppingen\u2019s team analysed several years of personality, wellbeing, and relationship satisfaction data from thousands of long-term married couples in America, taking into account each partner\u2019s relative scores on each of the five main personality traits.\n\nConsistent with past research, they found that by far the most important thing for overall wellbeing was the straight-forward effect of each person\u2019s personality. Generally speaking, individuals tended to be happier if they, and/or their partner, had more agreeable, more conscientious, less neurotic personalities (which is consistent with what we know about the links between these traits and happiness).\n\nBut crucially, and contrary to past research, this wasn\u2019t the whole story.\n\nHaving the same level of extraversion as one\u2019s partner was not ideal for overall wellbeing\n\nIt turned out that the comparative level of each partner\u2019s traits also mattered in a modest but meaningful way. Most of the time a perfect match was not beneficial. For instance, having the same level of extraversion as one\u2019s partner was not ideal for overall wellbeing (instead the optimal situation, at least for wellbeing, was for one person to be somewhat more extraverted than their partner). For people who had low levels of conscientiousness, similarity wasn\u2019t optimal either (it was better to be with someone with a somewhat higher level of conscientiousness).\n\nThe standout exception, but only for women, was agreeableness: a trait associated with trusting others and having more empathy. Greater similarity to one\u2019s partner was the ideal situation in terms of feeling more supported in the relationship. Less clear-cut, but also in favour of a similarity effect for both men and women, was a degree of similarity in openness (a trait associated with enjoying new experiences and appreciating art and culture).\n\nVan Scheppingen and her team speculated that some similarity in openness might be beneficial because of this trait\u2019s links with values and politics (greater openness is associated with holding more liberal attitudes, for example). Similarity therefore would lead to \u201cless conflict between spouses\u2019 views and actions, which could be linked to experiencing higher levels of relational well-being\u201d, the researchers write.\n\nOne research team found that the couples who showed greater similarity in the trait of openness were more likely to stay together\n\nThis tentative finding of a similarity effect for openness chimes with another recent paper that looked whether there is any connection between how similar partners are and how long their relationship lasts. Arguably this is a more objective measure than people\u2019s ratings of their wellbeing and feelings of support. Beatrice Rammstedt at the Gesis Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences in Germany had nearly 5,000 German couples complete personality questionnaires and tracked them for five years. Her team found that the couples who showed greater similarity in the trait of openness were more likely to stay together.\n\nThese weren\u2019t the only recent studies finding a benefit in similarity. Another recent paper also found that women benefit when they have similar levels of openness to their partners (the optimal situation was when both partners reported modest levels of openness). Yet another study found partner similarity was specifically helpful to anxiously attached individuals \u2013 people who worry about being abandoned.\n\nThere\u2019s evidence that similarities beyond the main personality traits matter, too. For instance, a recent study of heterosexual couples by the University of Warsaw\u2019s Paulina Jocz and her colleagues showed that women were happier in their relationship when they and their partner shared the same chronotype (that is, whether they were a morning or an evening person). They also found that both genders were more sexually satisfied if they had a shared preference for when in the day to have sex.\n\nAnother study has found that women were happier in their relationship when they shared political attitudes with their partners. And both men and women were happier if they and their partner put about the same amount of value on being free and independent-minded.\n\nThese studies focus on comparing partners\u2019 similarity as objectively as possible. But of course our subjective perceptions and feelings about our partners are probably just as important \u2013 if not more so \u2013 to how we feel about our relationships. And in this regard, psychologists have also been examining the effect of feeling a sense of shared identity with our partners, or what Courtney Walsh and Lisa Neff at the University of Texas, Austin call \u201cidentity fusion\u201d.\n\nIn their paper studying newlyweds, Walsh and Neff found that those individuals who felt their sense of identity was fused in a balanced way with their spouse\u2019s also tended to be more confident in their relationship and to deal more constructively with any marital turbulence.\n\nIt would be interesting to know how perceptions of a shared identity might interact with partner similarity. After all, if you can manage to achieve a form of companionship where it feels as though you and your partner have become one, then it seems likely that questions of similarity and difference will become a side issue \u2013 because now their traits and values are yours, too.\n\nIn general? It is probably safe to conclude that partner similarity does matter to relationships. The specific implications depend on gender, the traits in question, and even one\u2019s attachment style. There is no simple rule that applies to everyone, but it would be wrong to conclude that similarity is irrelevant.\n\n--\n\nDr Christian Jarrett edits the British Psychological Society's Research Digest blog.

    "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption These chicken nuggets were grown in a lab from cells taken from a living animal\n\nThere's a looming crisis over the world's growing appetite for meat. Could a chicken running around a farmyard in San Francisco hold the key to a solution?\n\nIn 1931, Winston Churchill predicted that the human race would one day \"escape the absurdity of growing a whole chicken in order to eat the breast or wing, by growing these parts separately under a suitable medium\".\n\nEighty-seven years later, that day has come as we discovered at Just, a food company in San Francisco where we tasted chicken nuggets grown from the cells of a chicken feather.\n\nThe chicken - which tasted like chicken - was still alive, reportedly roaming on a farm not far from the laboratory.\n\nThis meat is not to be confused with the vegetarian plant-based burgers and other meat-substitute products which are gaining popularity in supermarkets.\n\nNo, this is actual meat grown from animal cells and variously described as cultured, synthetic, in-vitro, lab-grown or even \"clean\" meat.\n\nt took about two days to grow our chicken nugget in a small bioreactor, using a protein to encourage the cells to multiply, some type of scaffold to give structure to the product and a culture, or growth, medium to feed the meat as it develops.\n\nThose two days in the bioreactor came after years of work identifying the best cell lines, cell isolation and cell bank development, using cells from feathers or harmless biopsies on live animals.\n\nImage copyright Alamy Image caption Billions of animals are slaughtered annually for meat\n\nOur chicken nugget was still in the prototype phase. Other prototypes can take days or weeks to grow. Just and other companies will need to speed up the process to mass produce the cellular meat.\n\nThe result is not yet commercially available anywhere on earth but Just's chief executive Josh Tetrick says it will be on the menu in a handful of restaurants by the end of this year.\n\n\"We make things like eggs or ice cream or butter out of plants and we make meat just out of meat. You just don't need to kill the animal,\" Tetrick says.\n\nWe were given a rare taste and the results were impressive. The skin was crisp and the meat flavoursome although its internal texture was slightly softer than you would expect from a nugget at, say, McDonalds or KFC.\n\nTetrick and other entrepreneurs working on cellular meat say they want to stop the slaughter of animals and protect the environment from the degradation of industrial factory farming.\n\nThey say they are solving the problem of how to feed a crowded earth without destroying the planet, pointing out that their meat is not genetically-modified and does not require antibiotics to grow.\n\nThe United Nations says raising animals for food is one of the major causes of global warming and air and water pollution. Even as the conventional livestock industry strives to become more efficient and environmentally friendly, many doubt it will be able to keep up with the rising global appetite for protein.\n\nWe slaughter 70 billion animals each year to feed seven billion people, says Dr Uma Valeti, a cardiologist who founded California-based Memphis Meats, a leading cell-based meat company.\n\nHe says the global demand for meat is doubling as more people rise out of poverty and that humanity won't be able to raise enough cattle and chicken to sate the appetite of nine billion people by 2050.\n\n\"So we could just literally grow any meat, poultry or seafood directly from those animal cells,\" Dr Valeti says. \"I think that is probably much bigger than sliced bread.\"\n\nMany Americans say they are eating less meat but US Department of Agriculture (USDA) figures suggest the average consumer will still consume more than 222lbs (100kg) of red meat and poultry this year - about 20lb more than they ate in the 1970s.\n\nImage caption The demand for meat is growing worldwide\n\nThe pioneer of cellular agriculture is Dutch scientist Mark Post. His first lab-grown hamburger, grilled in 2013, cost $300,000 (\u00a3228,000).\n\nNo company has yet scaled-up production to serve a cell-based patty commercially but Post estimates that if he started mass producing his burgers, he could get the cost of making them down to about $10 each.\n\n\"That's of course still way too high,\" he said.\n\nIf Just does manage to produce enough chicken nuggets to sell this year, it is unlikely to be in an American restaurant as the US government is still deciding how to proceed.\n\nMost food in the US is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). But some - mostly conventionally raised meat - is regulated by the USDA. So if you're buying a frozen pizza in the US, the USDA handles the pepperoni version and the FDA handles the cheese.\n\n\"There are a number of countries in Asia and Europe that we're talking to,\" Tetrick says. \"There's a lack of clarity\" about regulations in the US while the USDA and FDA hold public hearings, he explains.\n\n\"I think countries want to take the lead in this. Whether it's food scarcity, whether it's sustainability issues or they just want to build an entirely new economy, they want to take the lead in doing this,\" Tetrick said.\n\nThe eventual aim is to move cellular meat out of the laboratory and into large manufacturing plants.\n\nThere are now dozens of companies working in the field and they're attracting venture capitalist investment from across Silicon Valley and beyond. Billionaires Bill Gates and Richard Branson are among those who have ploughed money into the technology.\n\nThe product also has a more surprising benefactor in Tyson Foods, which has invested an undisclosed amount in Memphis Meats.\n\nTyson is the biggest meat processor in the US, processing around 424,000 pigs, 130,000 cows and 35 million chickens every week. So why is it investing in cellular meat?\n\nThe firm decided \"to shift from being a meat company to a protein company,\" said Tom Mastrobuoni, chief financial officer for Tyson's venture capital arm, Tyson Ventures.\n\n\"We've made the conscious decision that we're going to be the biggest protein company,\" he added.\n\nThe cutting edge technology of Silicon Valley may be synonymous with the freewheeling, entrepreneurial spirit of the United States but this is still a country where tradition runs deep.\n\nThe Cattlemen's Association has a powerful lobby and there's arguably no symbol more revered or romanticised in the nation's history than the cowboy.\n\nAnd so the ranchers of the mid-west are stepping into the debate about how this new product will be marketed - as clean meat, cellular meat, slaughter-free meat, ethical protein, or just meat?\n\nOn their ranch in the Ozarks, a mountainous region extending from Missouri into Arkansas, Kalena and Billy Bruce are feeding their herd of black Angus cattle, helped by their four-year-old daughter Willa.\n\nImage caption Kalena and Billy Bruce, with Willa\n\n\"I think it needs to be labelled accordingly - a lab-produced protein,\" says Billy Bruce. \"When I think of meat I think of what's standing behind us, a live breathing animal,\" he adds.\n\nThe state of Missouri agrees. At the urging of farmers, the legislature has decreed that meat labels may only be applied to the product of livestock. It is a hint of the disruption which traditional agriculture feels could be on the way.\n\n\"From a transparency standpoint for consumers, so that they know what they're purchasing and what they're feeding their families, we think that it needs to be called something different,\" says Kalena Bruce.\n\nLia Biondo, the director of policy and outreach with the US Cattlemen's association, based in Washington, DC, says she expects the Missouri law could be replicated in other states.\n\n\"We will let those companies decide what to call their products just as long as they don't call it beef or meat,\" says Biondo.\n\nBut in any case, will anyone actually eat it, especially here in cattle country?\n\nDiners at Lamberts, a traditional Midwest restaurant in Ozark, Missouri, are going to take some convincing.\n\n\"Meat oughta be growed on a farm, out in the fields,\" declares Jerry Kimrey, a construction worker from Lebanon, Missouri.\n\nTeacher Ashley Pospisil, also from Lebanon, says she would prefer not to eat cell-based meat.\n\n\"I like to know where it came from and that it's natural and not processed from a lab,\" she says.\n\nLinda Hilburn, who is tucking into a (cow) steak before heading home to Guthrie, Oklahoma agrees.\n\n\"I kind of like it having four feet in the beginning,\" she says.\n\n\"There's just something about man's creation that scares me. We've created havoc here. I kind of like the idea of God's creation.\"\n\nWhile Ms Hilburn is far from alone in feeling squeamish about the idea of \"Frankenstein food\" as critics have labelled it, Josh Tetrick insists that cell-based meat is entirely free from the many animal diseases which plague traditional meat production.\n\nAnd he is betting on human experience favouring progress.\n\n\"At the end of the day whether you're talking about a move from picking ice to refrigerator or from slaughtering a whale to refining oil into kerosene and moving from kerosene to a light bulb... even though people called the light bulb the Devil's current... humanity managed to embrace something new.\n\n\"It always happens and if I had to bet it'll happen for this too.\""

The striking shot scooped the top prize in the Landscape Photographer of the Year awards.\n\nThe competition, now in its 12th year, aims to highlight the splendour of Britain's rural and urban landscapes.\n\nImage copyright Pete Rowbottom\n\nThe judges chose Rowbottom's dramatic composition from thousands of entries celebrating the richly diverse landscape of the UK.\n\n\"The numerous strong diagonal lines of the ice fractures in Pete's image echo the shape of Buachaille Etive Mor in the background and have peaks of their own,\" said awards founder Charlie Waite.\n\n\"The cold of the mountain and ice together contrast well with the amber of their surroundings.\n\n\"This is an image where you can hear and feel the landscape as well as see it, so it is emotionally strong and involves the viewer on multiple levels.\"\n\nTop spot in the adult Classic View category went to John Finney for this image taken during a blizzard in the High Peak, Derbyshire.\n\nImage copyright John Finney\n\nThe runner-up spot in the same category went to Mario D'Onofrio for this stunning shot of the Milky Way over St Michael's Mount in Cornwall.\n\nImage copyright Mario D'Onofrio\n\n\"The 'teapot' of Sagittarius can also be clearly seen to the left of the Mount, along with Saturn, the brightest point in the sky here, just above the clouds creeping in from the right,\" says D'Onofrio.\n\n\"I must have taken hundreds of shots - but it was this single exposure that I ended up being most satisfied with to tell the story of that night.\"\n\nCornwall was also the location for the winning image in the adult Living the View category. This dramatic image of a fisherman braving the windy conditions at Porth Nanven was made by Mick Blakey.\n\nImage copyright Mick Blakey\n\n\"I was happy to just sit on the rocks and photograph the waves and spray - but then some magic happened... a fisherman appeared on the rocks in frame - I could not believe my luck,\" says Blakey.\n\nRod Ireland took the runner-up spot with this picture of the Cairngorms in the Highlands.\n\nImage copyright Rod Ireland\n\n\"I'd decided to make the most of the stunning winter conditions and have a couple of days skiing at Glenshee in the Cairngorms. I couldn't quite resist taking my camera with me though and decided to go off-piste and grab some shots between runs,\" says Ireland.\n\n\"The lighting was sublime, and I loved the textures and contrasts on the slopes facing me across the valley. It was only when I got home that I spotted the two mountaineers/skiers high up on the broad ridge, utterly dwarfed by their surroundings.\"\n\nFirst place in the adult Your View category went to Brain Kerr for this image of windswept trees in Leadhills, South Lanarkshire.\n\nImage copyright Brian Kerr\n\nRachel Talibart's photo of fog at Beachy Head Lighthouse, East Sussex, was highly commended in the same category.\n\nImage copyright Rachael Talibart\n\nAlex Wolfe-Warman won the adult Urban View category with this picture of houses in Bristol, taken during a hot-air balloon ride over the city.\n\nImage copyright Alex Wolfe-Warman\n\n\"I made a variety of photographs on the flight. This is one of my favourites. Visibility was excellent. And the light was beautiful at 20:00 on a warm July evening,\" says Wolfe-Warman.\n\nThe runner-up spot went to Andrew Midgley for a picture taken in Norfolk.\n\n\"I am always excited by the prospect of snow. I think this image is influenced by Nordic noir cinema, and a winter trip to Russia a few years ago,\" says Midgley.\n\nImage copyright Andrew Midgley\n\nThe Young Landscape Photographer of the Year title went to Josef FitzGerald-Patrick for his image of a mountain biker in action at Land's End, Cornwall.\n\nImage copyright Josef FitzGerald-Patrick\n\n\"Last year I met up with friend and fellow mountain biker Russ Pierre for a brilliant photo shoot but there was one image that, although stunning, had so much room for improvement,\" says FitzGerald-Patrick.\n\n\"We went back in the spring of 2018 to set about capturing the dream image. I found a good composition featuring a nice rocky drop for Russ to jump, with the Armed Knight and setting Sun behind it.

    "text": "\u201cWe suppose that the most common experiences are the same as, and translatable between, different cultures,\u201d writes Christopher Moore in his book In Other Words, \u201cbut this simply isn\u2019t so\u201d.\n\nInstead, Moore explains, some expressions can offer meanings unique to their own culture. For the book, he\u2019s collected 93 of his favourite mots justes from more than 35 tongues, including Swahili, Maori and Urdu. Some offer insights into the values of that language group; others are amusing turns of phrase. They each capture something particular with satisfying precision.\n\nMore like this:\n\n\u2013 Can language slow down time?\n\n\u2013 Britain\u2019s centuries-old secret slang\n\n\u2013 Obscure words with delightful meanings\n\nShibui (Japanese)\n\n\u201cShibui describes an aesthetic that only time can reveal,\u201d according to Moore. \u201cAs we become older and more marked by the riches of life\u2019s experience, we radiate with a beauty that stems from becoming fully ourselves. The term can be applied to almost anything \u2013 a person, a house, or even a piece of aged wood.\u201d\n\nGagung (Cantonese)\n\nThe one-child policy in China has altered the population\u2019s gender balance, leaving a surplus of males. That has been recognised in a poignant expression. \u201cThis sad term, which means \u2018bare sticks\u2019 or \u2018bare branches\u2019, refers to men who are unlikely to marry or to have families because of the skewed sex ratios,\u201d writes Moore.\n\nFroufrou (French)\n\n\u201cA rustling, especially that of a woman\u2019s skirt, and one of the nicest onomatopoeic words around. This lovely expression evokes the whole risqu\u00e9 world of th\u00e9s dansants, soir\u00e9es intimes, and the institution of the discreet venue, the chambre s\u00e9par\u00e9e,\u201d writes Moore.\n\nWeltschmerz (German)\n\nA compound word made up of Welt,meaning \u2018world\u2019 and Schmerz,meaning \u2018pain\u2019. According to Moore, \u201cjust as your head can hurt (Kopfschmerzen) or you can suffer from a stomach ache (Magenschmerzen), so the world can hurt too. In its mildest form, this is \u2018world-weariness\u2019. At the other extreme, it\u2019s an existential pain that leaves you reeling with a damaging, head-clutching despair.\u201d\n\nMet iemand in de Koffer duiken (Dutch)\n\n\u201cIn the Netherlands you don\u2019t have a roll in the hay with someone,\u201d says Moore, \u201cyou \u2018jump in a suitcase together\u2019 \u2013 possibly to elope, but probably suggesting a dirty weekend away. While not the kind of phrase you\u2019d use to initiate a romantic encounter, this is still the sort of schoolyard insult that will get a laugh.\u201d\n\nCavoli riscaldati (Italian)\n\n\u201cLiterally \u2018reheated cabbage\u2019,\u201d according to Moore, \u201cthis Italian phrase describes a pointless attempt to revive a former love affair, and comes from a proverb: cavoli riscaldati n\u00e9 amore ritornato non fu mai buono \u2013 \u2018neither reheated cabbage nor revived love is ever any good\u2019.\u201d\n\nYolki-palki (Russian)\n\n\u201cA peculiar Russian expression which could express surprise, dismay or pleasure, depending on the situation,\u201d writes Moore. \u201cThe phrase literally translates as \u2018fir trees and sticks\u2019 but is probably approximated in English by the expression \u2018holy cow!\u2019\u201d\n\nThese expressions can often be entertaining \u2013 yet they also reveal differences not just in language, but in ways of thinking. As Moore points out, \u201cTake the example of dreaming. What are we to make of the fact that languages such as Spanish and Italian have the same noun for sleep as for dream, while others, like French and English, differentiate between the two? Do some nations sleep differently from others?\u201d\n\nThey can offer an insight into prevailing attitudes, too. \u201cIn Britain, for example, where an Englishman\u2019s home is his castle and it is possible to live for years without knowing your neighbours, the phrase \u2018living together\u2019 refers without ambiguity to the domestic arrangement of unmarried couples,\u201d says Moore.\n\n\u201cGermany throws its hat in the ring with the word zusammenleben, a more pragmatic notion of \u2018getting along\u2019 in your family or in the community\u2026 In Spain, the word convivencia alludes to \u2018living together with others\u2019, the quality of a society where citizens get along by practising tolerance and mutual respect. In this sense, it comes close to meaning a \u2018civic culture\u2019.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a reminder of something meaningful about opening ourselves up to new concepts in other languages. \u201cPeople who are not us speak, write and do things that are alien and mysterious but which, when explained, often make an awful lot of sense,\u201d writes Simon Winchester in the book\u2019s foreword. \u201cThe understanding of tongues other than our own offers us a chance to come to a better understanding of peoples other than ourselves.\u201d\n\nIn Other Words: An Illustrated Miscellany of the World\u2019s Most Intriguing Words and Phrases (Modern Books) by Christopher Moore (illustrated by Lan Truong) is out now.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    ],
    "text": "I met my now best friend Hanna a few years ago during my first visit to Helsinki, on a coffee date set up out of desperation. Without any acquaintances in the city, I just wanted someone to sit next to in public, and given our tenuous work connection, she fitted the bill. Our drink quickly turned into dinner, wrapping up four hours later after doing deep dives on politics, religion, sex and life, the kind of topics that usually take friends years to address. A year later, I flew back to be a bridesmaid at her wedding, still shocked at how fast we forged a connection.\n\n\u201cLaura,\u201d she told me matter-of-factly when I asked why we had bonded so quickly.\n\nWhat she neglected to tell me, however, is that Finns think if there\u2019s no important topic to discuss, there\u2019s no conversation at all. In fact, one of their national sayings is \u2018Silence is gold, talking is silver\u2019.\n\nSmall talk outside social situations between close friends is virtually non-existent. Interactions with baristas? Limited to the name of the coffee you want to order. Sitting, walking or standing in a way that requires acknowledging a stranger\u2019s presence? Never. (A meme featuring people standing outside a bus shelter rather than under it is an often-posted joke in Finland to illustrate this point.) If you\u2019re a foreigner, congratulations \u2013 you\u2019re probably the loudest person on their often (voluntarily) silent public transport.\n\nWith two million saunas in the country, which are enjoyed fully nude (generally gender-segregated, although that rule tends to be thrown out in the company of friends), the Finnish seem to have no problem with getting up close and personal. But when clothes are on, the bets are off.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 Europe\u2019s nation of introverts\n\n\u2022 Where Dutch directness comes from\n\n\u2022 What the Indian head wobble really says\n\nFinnish people often forgo the conversational niceties that are hard-baked into other cultures, and typically don\u2019t see the need to meet foreign colleagues, tourists and friends in the middle. As Tiina Latvala, a former English instructor in Sodankyl\u00e4, Lapland, explained, part of her job was to introduce her young students to the concept of small talk.\n\n\u201cWe had a practice where you had to pretend to meet someone for the first time,\u201d Latvala said. \u201cYou had to pretend you were meeting at the cafe or on a bus and [that] you didn\u2019t know each other and do a bit of chit chat. We had written on the whiteboard all the safe topics so they didn\u2019t have to struggle with coming up with something to talk about. We brainstormed. They usually found it really difficult.\u201d\n\nAlina Jefremoff, an 18-year-old Finnish student in Helsinki, recalls similarly formatted exercises with an air of incredulity. Thanks to television and films (which are mostly broadcast in English) she was already acquainted with non-Finnish communication styles. Even still, she had to endure a series of connect-the-dot-style homework assignments.\n\n\u201c[They\u2019re] about basic conversation,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe answers are already there. We are taught to answer \u2018I\u2019m great, how about you?\u2019; \u2018How is your mum?\u2019. It was very clear how to be in a conversation, as if we didn\u2019t already know. It was very weird\u2026 as if there were right answers to the questions.\u201d\n\nWhen asked for an example of how she wishes Finnish society were more open, Jefremoff gave the example of doing something ridiculous, like dropping her books in the metro, and then laughing at herself. She says she wishes that strangers would join her in acknowledging the silliness of the situation by laughing or commenting. Initiating social contact with people you don\u2019t know? Not something they\u2019ve been taught.\n\nThere are more hypotheses than answers for why Finnish culture has a veil of silence permanently stitched in place. Latvala believes their trademark directness has something to do with the complexity of the Finnish language and the fairly large distance between cities (Latvala\u2019s reasoning: If you\u2019ve travelled any distance to see someone, why waste time?).\n\nHowever, Prof Laura Kolbe, who teaches European history at the University of Helsinki, sees the topic through a comparative lens. The Finns, she says, don\u2019t see their quietness or lack of small talk as a negative. Instead, every culture judges another on their social norms, hence the widespread stereotype of the silent Finn among more emotive nationalities.\n\n\u201cThe idea of silence has been especially prevalent when Finns were seen from the eyes of close neighbours,\u201d she explained. \u201cFor example, when Swedish- and German-speaking people came to Finland in the past, they saw Finns as silent citizens, wondering why the people didn\u2019t speak any Swedish or German and rather remained silent among their guests.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t for lack of skill, for Finland has two national languages \u2013 Finnish and Swedish \u2013 and Finns begin English lessons when they\u2019re six or seven. But rather it\u2019s because when faced with expressing themselves in second (or third) language, many often choose to not say anything rather than risk not being fully understood. However, when among their own, silence functions as an extension of comfortable conversation.\n\nIt\u2019s an idea that\u2019s backed up by Dr Anna Vatanen, a researcher at the University of Oulu, whose forthcoming study \u2018Lapses in interaction and the stereotype of the Silent Finn\u2019 demonstrates that at least among their own, Finns do communicate through comfortable silence \u2013 particularly among familiars. When it comes to outsiders judging the stereotypically straightforward Finn, she warns that some nuances do get lost in translation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the structure or features of the language, but rather the ways in which people use the language to do things,\u201d she explained via email. \u201cFor instance, the \u2018how are you?\u2019 question that is most often placed in the very beginning of an encounter. In English-speaking countries, it is mostly used just as a greeting and no serious answer is expected to it. On the contrary, the Finnish counterpart (Mit\u00e4 kuuluu?) can expect a \u2018real\u2019 answer after it: quite often the person responding to the question starts to tell how his or her life really is at the moment, what\u2019s new, how they have been doing.\u201d\n\nBut when Finns do opt out of casual conversation, says Karoliina Korhonen, author of Finnish Nightmares, a book and online comic series where an \u2018average\u2019 Finn deals with life\u2019s most benign terrors, it also has something to do with respect. Why risk making someone else feel uncomfortable?\n\n\u201cI like to think Finnish people value personal space,\u201d she notes. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know another person, you don\u2019t want to bother them. They might be having their own time or they don\u2019t want a stranger to come bother them. If you see they\u2019re open and you both are open, you can have something. But most of the time people are polite and keep their distance.\u201d\n\nBut their desire for avoidance is a predisposition so common that it\u2019s become hard-baked into Finnish culture. Formula One driver Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen has built his iconic image around his lack of talking. Comics use the Finn\u2019s lack of small talk as part of their routine. It\u2019s even gone international: thanks to the unexpected spike in popularity of Korhonen\u2019s work in China, teens there who don\u2019t enjoy social interactions are describing themselves as \u2018spiritually Finnish\u2019.\n\nIn some cases, though, Finnish society seems to be trending toward a marginally more open existence. However, it\u2019s happening slowly. For Jussi Salonen, COO of Finnish chocolate company Goodio, living in Los Angeles for two years made him wish he could import a bit more of the US\u2019 open spirit to his home country.\n\n\u201cWhen I was [back] in Finland, I was almost offended when I went to get a cup of coffee from a coffee shop and they didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt was just \u2018what do you want?\u2019. How can you say that? Are you not going to ask anything before that? Oh, yeah. This is my home country. This is just the way things are. It was funny to notice how things got twisted a little bit when I was living over there\u2026 I think a little bit of communication or small talk doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a hopeful idea that Finns can meet the rest of the world in the middle while respecting each other\u2019s privacy. But for now, it leaves Finland with one of the most interesting social dichotomies. Sure, you might not speak to people on the street. But if you\u2019re lucky, sometimes a stranger will instantly become a friend and tell you everything.\n\nCORRECTION: This story originally had offensive language, which has now been removed.\n\nWhy We Are What We Are is a BBC Travel series examining the characteristics of a country and investigating whether they are true.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

However, Mr Wada added that this would have a \"minimal\" impact on next year's sakura season.\n\nJapan was this year hit by a series of typhoons, including Typhoon Jebi - the strongest storm to hit Japan in a quarter of a century.

    "text": "London Fashion Week recently became the first global fashion week to ban animal fur. Campaigners were euphoric. In the past year, fur has faced significant challenges everywhere, but still \u2013 it was quite a moment. Then, a few weeks later, Los Angeles voted to ban the manufacture and sale of fur within city limits, becoming the largest American city to do so. Has fur \u2013 fashion\u2019s most controversial material \u2013 finally had its day?\n\nIt certainly looks like it. Week after week, another luxury house is ditching it. Burberry, now helmed by Riccardo Tisci, made its stand just a day before the British Fashion Council event; Gucci, Michael Kors, Tom Ford, John Galliano, Maison Margiela, Jimmy Choo and Versace within the past two years. Stella McCartney, undisputed queen of green luxury, has of course been fur-free from the start.\n\nLast June, luxury online behemoth Yoox Net-a-Porter, which sells to some of fur\u2019s biggest consumers such as China, announced it was going fur-free \u2013 citing customer feedback. \u201cDo you think using furs today is still modern?\u201d Gucci CEO Marco Bizzarri asked eager students at the London College of Fashion in October 2017. \u201cI don't think so. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re not doing it.\u201d For an industry that prides itself on being buzzy and on-the-ball, Bizzarri\u2019s statement was a death knell for real fur.\n\nPeople don't want to see [real] fur; it\u2019s come to symbolise a selfishness they don\u2019t want to endorse \u2013 Wendy Higgins\n\nAbout time too. From wild trapping to the horrors of a Chinese fur market, where live skinning is par for the course, nothing about fur production is easy. Films such as Klatki have uncovered the devastating lives of animals on European fur farms. \u201cFur is immoral, cruel and barbaric \u2013 it is an industry that capitalises on death,\u201d says a call-to-action on McCartney\u2019s website. As one look at the small, traumatised creatures in Klatki will demonstrate, she\u2019s not exaggerating.\n\nWhy is fashion moving so fast to distance itself from fur now? \u201cIncreasingly, consumers expect brands to demonstrate social responsibility, sustainability and animal welfare; the fur-free movement is part of that zeitgeist,\u201d says Wendy Higgins, media director for Humane Society International. \u201cPeople don't want to see fur; it\u2019s come to symbolise a selfishness they don\u2019t want to endorse. That realisation by designers like Gucci has created a domino effect.\u201d\n\nNone of this comes as a surprise to Kym Canter, ex-creative director of ultra-glam label J Mendel, self-confessed former fur addict and now director of her own ethical faux-fur company, House of Fluff. \u201cI switched teams,\u201d she laughs. \u201cSome of my favourite coats were so glamorous, and then, one day I thought, this is insane, I\u2019m an animal lover and I\u2019m wearing garments that don\u2019t match my morals.\u201d\n\nBut finding stylish alternatives proved tricky so, fresh from a luxury background, Canter decided to make her own: \u201cHouse of Fluff is about faking something you\u2019d respond to as rock \u2018n\u2019 roll.\u201d Her coats \u2013 slinky leopard print trenches, soft \u2018Mongolian lamb\u2019 boleros, \u2018Teddy\u2019 bombers \u2013 are impossibly luxurious, about as far away from scratchy high street shagpiles as you can get. Think Anita Pallenberg in her heyday \u2013 without the cruelty.\n\nEthical luxury\n\nFor Hannah Weiland, founder of British-based technicolour faux-fur label Shrimps, the standard of new faux is the key to its longevity. \u201cWhen I launched in 2013, there weren\u2019t any high-quality options,\u201d she remembers. \u201cAs soon as people felt our faux, they were impressed. And that makes the argument for real fur much harder.\u201d Plus, this is fashion made to last. \u201cThese are coats you\u2019re going to wear for multiple seasons, even pass down,\u201d says Canter. \u201cThey\u2019re luxe products.\u201d\n\nIndeed they are. All those newly fur-free luxury houses are embracing faux with a passion, elevating both design standards and materials. MM6 Maison Margiela's oversized shaggy coat in a rich teal is a keeper; as is McCartney\u2019s autumn/winter 2018 textured beige wrap. And no one is going to forget Cara Delevingne marching down the runway in Burberry\u2019s faux fur rainbow cape, outgoing creative director Christopher Bailey\u2019s swansong on February\u2019s autumn/winter catwalk.\n\nBut campaigners can\u2019t rest on their laurels just yet. For all its animal-friendly credentials, most faux is made from modacrylic, a derivative of oil and synthetics. This means that, like other petroleum-based products, it pollutes during production, releases microfibres on washing and won\u2019t biodegrade. The pro-fur lobby, which is big and powerful, take great joy in going on about this, citing fur as the only genuinely sustainable option.\n\nToday\u2019s best faux-fur designers are making real efforts to help the planet\n\nMeanwhile, consumers keen to do the right thing are left at a loss: go faux for the animals \u2013 or go real for the planet? No contest, says Higgins. \u201cAll materials we use in fashion have some kind of eco-footprint \u2013 including fur,\u201d she points out. \u201cAnd the impact of fur production can't be overstated, from CO2 emissions and manure runoff on fur farms, to the cocktail of chemicals used in fur dressing and dyeing. Fur is far from earth-friendly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get distracted,\u201d adds Canter. \u201cThere are loads of studies showing that real fur is actually much more harmful to the environment than faux. The fur industry has a billion dollars to spend on advertising. They\u2019re smart, they\u2019re worried and they have a lot of people crafting [its] message. So far, it\u2019s been extremely effective.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, today\u2019s best faux-fur designers are making real efforts to help the planet. Canter\u2019s brand works with organic and sustainable materials wherever possible, and makes everything locally; its edgy flagship in New York\u2019s Bowery is built from upcycled materials. Reusable fabric garment bags are made from by a women\u2019s cooperative in El Salvador. Ditto Stella McCartney, whose offices and factories consider all aspects of environmental impact.\n\nFor those still twitchy about faux\u2019s eco-credentials, however, options are emerging. For autumn/winter 2018, sustainable Brit pioneers Vin & Omi finished their show with a big, bouncy coat made from the combed-out raw fleeces of 10 pet llamas who are still gambolling about their smallholdings today. \u201cWe wanted to include raw fleece as it has an incredible softness,\u201d says OmI. \u201cAnd we wanted the audience to appreciate that high-end fashion can be eco and wearable.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s biotech, increasingly being used to find lab-friendly alternatives to animals in food, fashion and beyond, says Mina Jugovic at the Centre for Sustainable Fashion. She cites as examples the living-moss collars by London College of Fashion student Tara Baoth Mooney \u2013 \u201cHer moss pelts promote the concept of \u2018symbiotic biomimicry\u201d \u00ad\u2013 and Ashleigh Chambers, who is currently working on a biodegradable faux fur with a new cellulose fibre created from rose bushes.\n\nMeanwhile, designer Ingvar Helgason at BioFur\u2019s lab-grown pelts are created from stem-cells while, at the Faux Fur Institute, founded by Arnaud Brunois in retort to claims by the International Fur Federation, researchers are developing a fibre made from 40 per cent plant-based ingredients, to reduce faux\u2019s dependency on petroleum-based product, as well as safe methods to recycle faux fur and ways to turn synthetics into energy.\n\nIn New York, Canter is working with chemists to create an \u201ceven more Earth-friendly faux fur\u201d. \u201cAt the level of the threads and the textile,\u201d she says, eagerly. \u201cWe want to have that ready to come to market in a year. We\u2019re super committed to this. Faux can be made from plant-friendly, animal-friendly ingredients \u2013 and we\u2019re working on it.\u201d\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter."

      "Jessica Brown"
    ],
    "text": "As the days get shorter in the Northern hemisphere, concerns tend to arise about the lack of sunlight \u2013 and possible vitamin D deficiency. For many, a go-to fix is to take supplements.\n\nThe supplement, after all, has been touted as a near-miracle. Both vitamin D2 and D3 supplements are available over-the-counter without a prescription and have been linked to improving immunity, tiredness and muscle weakness, bone pain, and depression. They\u2019ve also been said to help stave off cancer and the consequences of ageing.\n\nIt may be little wonder that, according to research by market analysis company Mintel, a third of adults in the UK who take vitamin supplements count vitamin D among them.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 Why vitamin supplements don\u2019t work\n\n\u2022 The world\u2019s most nutritious foods\n\n\u2022 What I learnt by living without artificial light\n\nBut the debate over whether all adults need to take vitamin D supplements is contentious.\n\nOne study estimates that around 20% of the population in the UK has a profound vitamin D deficiency\n\nFew doubt the role that vitamin D plays in our bone health to regulate calcium and phosphate in the body, which is why those who have a vitamin D deficiency are particularly encouraged to address it. And that may be more people than you think: one study estimates that around 20% of the population in the UK has a profound vitamin D deficiency, for example.\n\nBut some experts say that people with healthy levels have no need of vitamin D supplements \u2013 which would be most people. In other words, they argue that in healthy people, vitamin D is not, as some have hoped, a way to prevent disease.\n\nSo what\u2019s the reality?\n\nThe basics\n\nDespite its name, vitamin D is not a vitamin. Instead, it is a hormone that promotes the absorption of calcium in the body. The challenge is that, aside from a few foods like oily fish, vitamin D is hard to find in the average diet. But in the presence of \u2018ultraviolet B\u2019 rays, our skin can produce its own from a common cholesterol.\n\nThere are two main types of D. The first is vitamin D3, which is found in animals including fish and is the kind the skin makes when exposed to sunlight. The second is vitamin D2, which comes from plant-based foods including mushrooms. Studies have found that D3 is more effective, and the conclusions of a 2012 meta-analysis argue that D3 is the preferred choice for supplementation.\n\nToday, the UK\u2019s Public Health England (PHE) recommends every adult takes a 10-microgram supplement in autumn and winter, when the angle of the sunlight hitting the earth prevents as many UVB rays from penetrating the atmosphere. The government body also recommends that those at risk of lower vitamin D levels, including people with darker skin, take a supplement year-round.\n\nOther countries follow similar guidelines. In Canada, adults are advised to get 15 micrograms of vitamin D and have two servings of vitamin-D fortified milk or soy alternatives every day, while cow's milk and margarine must be fortified with vitamin D by law. In the US, adults also are advised to get 15 micrograms, while much of the country\u2019s milk, breakfast cereals, margarine, yogurts and orange juice is fortified, too.\n\nThose guidelines and fortification efforts came about largely in an attempt to fight rickets in the mid-20th Century. We know that low vitamin D levels reduce the body\u2019s levels of calcium, which leads to a decrease in bone density and can cause rickets, particularly in babies and children.\n\nWe also know that low vitamin D may cause muscle weakness and fatigue. One study found that low vitamin D was high among people with fatigue and that their symptoms improved after five weeks of vitamin D supplements, while a small study from Newcastle University found that low vitamin D could cause fatigue as low levels cause mitochondria, the \u2018power stations\u2019 in every cell of the body, to be less efficient. Studies of cancer patients have found similar effects. Vitamin D may also help bolster and regulate the immune system by clearing bacteria.\n\nBroken bones\n\nBut vitamin D\u2019s importance doesn\u2019t necessarily mean people with healthy levels of vitamin D require supplements. Consider one of the most common reasons for supplementation: bone growth and maintenance.\n\nThe current guidelines on how much vitamin D to take were informed by research involving the elderly population living in care homes, who don\u2019t get as much exposure to the sun and are more prone to fractures and osteoporosis than the general population. But Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London, has argued that such studies are \u201cprobably flawed\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the evidence isn\u2019t clear-cut. One meta-analysis published in August 2018 concluded that increasing the levels of vitamin D in the general population is unlikely to decrease the risk of bone fractures in healthy people. And a meta-analysis of 81 studies found that vitamin D supplementation doesn\u2019t prevent fractures or falls, or improve bone mineral density. The researchers concluded that guidelines should be updated to reflect this.\n\nBut Sarah Leyland, osteoporosis nurse consultant at the National Osteoporosis Society, says vitamin D supplements may be useful for at-risk groups who don\u2019t get any sunlight exposure. According to the NHS, people only need to be outside for a short period of time, with hands and forearms uncovered and without sunscreen, to get enough vitamin D between March and October.\n\nHealthy people won\u2019t reduce their fracture risk by taking calcium and vitamin D supplements \u2013 Sarah Leyland\n\n\u201cWe know that healthy people living in the community won\u2019t reduce their fracture risk by taking calcium and vitamin D supplements,\u201d Leyland says. \u201cHowever, people who may not be getting enough \u2013 such as those who are housebound or live in sheltered accommodation \u2013 can benefit from these supplements.\u201d\n\nStill, researchers haven\u2019t found clear evidence of that, either. One meta-analysis examining the prevention of fractures in community, nursing home and hospital inpatient populations concluded that vitamin D alone is unlikely to prevent fractures in the doses and formulations tested so far in older people. And some evidence suggests that high doses can actually result in an increased number of fractures and falls. One randomised study found that high-dose monthly vitamin D supplements increased the risk of falls among the elderly population by 20-30% compared to those on a lower dose.\n\nD for disease\n\nThere is also conflicting research on the relationship between vitamin D and other diseases, even ageing.\n\nOne main claim is that vitamin D supplements will boost the immune system. Adrian Martineau, professor of respiratory infection and immunity at The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, who leads a research group on the effects of vitamin D on health, has found that vitamin D plays a role in improving respiratory infections.\n\nWhen his team analysed raw data from 25 clinical trials involving 11,000 patients from 14 countries, they found a small benefit to taking daily or weekly vitamin D supplements to reduce the risk of respiratory infections, asthma attacks and bronchitis. Although the paper soon attracted robust criticism, Martineau points out that the reduction of risk, while slight, is still significant and comparable to the effects of other health measures: to prevent a single respiratory infection, you\u2019d have to give 33 people vitamin D supplements \u2013 compared to, for example, giving a flu vaccination to 40 people to prevent a single case of flu.\n\nOr take ageing. One paper looking at the link between vitamin D and life expectancy found that vitamin D3 can help with protein homeostasis \u2013 the process by which proteins are regulated within cells to maintain their health. \u201cOur observation that D3 improves protein homeostasis and slows ageing highlights the importance of maintaining appropriate vitamin D serum levels,\u201d the researchers write.\n\nBut other studies have been less conclusive. One meta-analysis concluded that more research is needed to clarify the effect of vitamin D on mortality. The link between cardiovascular disease and vitamin D also has yet been properly established: the link could mean that heart disease is causing low vitamin D levels, not the other way around.\n\nCorrelation or causation?\n\nThis is an issue with nearly all of the studies that link low D to diseases.\n\nIf you take any group of patients with almost any disease, their vitamin D levels will be lower than in a healthy individual \u2013 Ian Reid\n\nIan Reid, professor in medicine at the University of Auckland, believes that diseases cause low vitamin D levels, as being unwell often leads to spending less time outdoors exposed to sunlight, rather than vice versa. \u201cIf you take any group of patients with almost any disease, their vitamin D levels will be lower than in a healthy individual. This has led some to hypothesise it\u2019s low vitamin D developing the disease, but there\u2019s no evidence to prove it,\u201d he says.\n\nResearchers have found that higher vitamin D levels are associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer \u2013 it plays a role in stemming the formation of new blood vessels and stimulating better communication between cells. Vitamin D also has been found to help maintain normal levels of calcium in the colon, which slows growth of non-cancerous but high-risk cells.\n\nOther studies, including of the link between vitamin D and liver cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer, suggest there is good reason to think that low vitamin D plays a part in the spread of cancer cells. But taking supplements would then, surely, help stave off cancer \u2013 and a recent meta-analysis failed to find that supplementation reduced cancer risk.\n\n\u201cThis is likely to be a two-way street, with cancer causing vitamin D deficiency by affecting vitamin D metabolism, dietary intake and sun exposure, and vice versa via anti-proliferative effects of vitamin D. The two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive,\u201d says Martineau.\n\nD for depression\n\nAnother oft-discussed condition is seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a mood disorder caused by the seasonal drop in exposure to sunlight. The link between light exposure and SAD is long-established. But again, a direct link to vitamin D has been difficult to prove.\n\nVitamin D is associated with levels of both serotonin, important for mood regulation, and melatonin, which regulates our sleep\n\nEvidence suggests there may be a relationship since vitamin D is associated with levels of both serotonin, important for mood regulation, and melatonin, which regulates our sleep. Low levels of either hormone could contribute to SAD symptoms. Researchers have yet to carry out a definitive randomised control trial, however, and the exact mechanism by which vitamin D bolsters the hormones is unknown. One theory is that vitamin D receptors \u2013 which are found in many parts of the brain and concentrated in the hypothalamus, a region involved in our circadian timing \u2013 play a part in controlling the body\u2019s hormone levels.\n\nResearch has found that vitamin D plays a wider role in our mental health, from depression to schizophrenia, as well as in brain development, but how it plays a role also remains unclear. A meta-analysis published earlier this year found that while there is a correlation between lower vitamin D levels and depression, that didn\u2019t necessarily mean D caused depression.\n\nAgain, perhaps depressed people just went out less and got less sunlight.\n\nSunshine serum\n\nIf studies are inconclusive, though, perhaps that doesn\u2019t reflect on the importance of vitamin D. Perhaps it\u2019s the fact that most of them are based on supplements, not sunshine.\n\nSome scientists argue that getting vitamin D from supplements isn\u2019t as effective as getting it straight from the sun, as the process that happens before the body makes vitamin D from sun exposure is more beneficial. More conclusive research around this is currently underway.\n\nEven so, most experts generally agree that even vitamin D supplements can benefit those who have very low levels. Martineau says his research found that those with low levels of vitamin D tend to see the most benefits of supplementation preventing respiratory infections, whereas the effects are a lot more modest when levels are moderately low.\n\nReid says his studies have also shown benefits in those with low levels. But as most people have vitamin D levels above that threshold, they wouldn\u2019t see benefits from supplementing.\n\nThe trouble is that it can be difficult to predict who is at a highest risk of suffering from low vitamin D. As medical historian Roberta Bivins of the University of Warwick points out, the amount of vitamin D a person stores, and therefore requires over winter, isn\u2019t just dependent on skin tone and the amount of time a person spend outdoors.\n\nIt\u2019s very individual how much sun exposure a person needs \u2013 Roberta Bivins\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very individual how much sun exposure a person needs during summer, depending on the pigment in the skin to the amount of fat in the body and how quickly your body makes new bone. It\u2019s incredibly complicated,\u201d she says.\n\nThat\u2019s why the best way to determine if you have low vitamin D is not by symptoms alone, but with a blood test arranged through your medic.\n\nSupplement levels\n\nThen there is the question of exactly what level of supplementation people need. Reid says there\u2019s \u201cno danger\u201d in taking over-the-counter vitamin D of less than 25 nanomols per day.\n\nBut with supplements offering doses as high as 62.5 micrograms available over the counter, there are concerns around the risk of excessive vitamin D levels, which can, in rare cases, cause side effects, including nausea and vomiting. In the long term, some studies suggest too much vitamin D can increase risk of cardiovascular disease, although the research isn\u2019t conclusive.\n\nBut others argue that even more vitamin D is needed.\n\nIn 2012, chief medical officer Sally Davies wrote a letter to GPs urging them to recommend vitamin D supplements to all at-risk groups, writing that a \u201csignificant proportion\u201d of people in the UK probably have inadequate levels of vitamin D. In June 2018, researchers from the University of Birmingham's Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research wrote that the death of a baby from complications of heart failure caused by severe vitamin D deficiency, and the serious health complications of two others, was just the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d in vitamin D deficiencies among those at risk.\n\nSuma Uday, co-author of the paper and PhD doctoral researcher at the university, says these deficiencies occur because infant vitamin D supplementation programs are poorly implemented in the UK and not monitored. \u201cIn the infants we describe, deficiency occurred because infant vitamin D supplementation was not recommended or monitored. Any infant devoid of vitamin D for prolonged durations can develop low calcium levels, which can result in life threatening complications such as seizures and heart failure,\u201d she says.\n\nWith such conflicting results, it\u2019s unsurprising that medical experts themselves are deeply divided over the benefits of widespread supplementation. Some even argue that vested interests are propping up the billion-dollar vitamin industry, with Spector calling vitamin D supplements a \u201cpseudo-vitamin for a pseudo-disease\u201d.\n\nWhile the debate continues, many experts are looking to Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School in Boston, whose researchers are carrying out a long-awaited randomised trial, VITAL, to investigate whether supplementation of vitamin D and omega 3 has any effect on cancer, stroke and heart disease in 25,000 adults.\n\nIt\u2019s hoped that these results, expected to publish later this year, will bring the debate closer to being resolved. In the meantime, it\u2019s widely agreed that vitamin D supplements, especially over winter, will be a waste of money at worst.\n\nIt\u2019s likely you won\u2019t get enough from your diet between now and next spring, but the impact this could have on your health is still up for debate.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nAll content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional.

    "authors": [],
    "text": "\u201cIf you have a technology that has the potential to save millions of lives, then you need to think about the ethics of not using it.\u201d\n\n\n\nScientists have created a \u2018gene drive\u2019: a piece of genetic code that stops female mosquitoes from producing eggs. They also manipulate the laws of inheritance so that almost 100% of offspring become carriers of the new gene, instead of the 50% that would naturally.\n\n\n\nProfessors James Miller and Peter Morris spoke to Good Morning Scotland about the pros and cons of this new form of gene technology with the potential to wipe out Anopheles gambiae, the breed of mosquito that spreads malaria.\n\nYou must enable JavaScript to play content\n\nA \u2018moral obligation\u2019\n\nGiven that the gene technology has the potential to save (human) lives \u2013 445,000 people died from Malaria in 2016 alone \u2013 Professor James Miller felt it was a \u2018moral obligation\u2019 to eradicate the mosquito.\n\nHe also described a situation where the same technology could be used nefariously: bioterrorists could infect mosquitoes with viruses capable of spreading to humans. To Prof Miller, that qualified the need to eradicate the mosquito even further.\n\nAsked if he could see people objecting to the culling of mosquitoes, Professor Miller responded,\u201cIt\u2019s as likely as the world deciding, \u2018Hey, the world is better off with smallpox\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe downsides of altering genes\n\nProfessor Peter Morris explained that experiments involving gene technology have only been used to eliminate a captive population of mosquitoes, so scientists don\u2019t know for certain how it will work in nature.\n\n\u201cWe do have to look at food chains; mosquitoes are food for fish, bats and birds. Also, male mosquitoes pollinate plants.\u201d\n\nAs well as the risk of modified genomes crossing into related species of mosquitoes, Professor Morris said it could be difficult to measure the effect of altering the genes.\n\n\u201cYou would effectively have to have a census of the mosquitoes to see if it was successful.\u201d"

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Pompeii was famously destroyed on 24 August in 79 AD - or was it?\n\nArchaeologists in Italy have uncovered an inscription they say may show that the history books have been wrong for centuries.\n\nHistorians have long believed that Mount Vesuvius erupted on 24 August 79 AD, destroying the nearby Roman city of Pompeii.\n\nBut now, an inscription has been uncovered dated to mid-October - almost two months later.\n\nItaly's culture minister labelled it \"an extraordinary discovery.\"\n\n\"The new excavations demonstrate the exceptional skill of our country,\" Alberto Bonisoli said.\n\nHistorians have been able to date the eruption of Vesuvius with apparent certainty thanks to ancient writings that purported to share first-hand accounts.\n\nThey came from Pliny the Younger, an elite lawyer and author of ancient Rome, who wrote about the death of his even more famous uncle, Pliny the Elder.\n\n\"On the 24th of August, about one in the afternoon, my mother desired him to observe a cloud...\" he wrote in a letter to Tacitus, a Roman senator and historian, about the events of that day.\n\nAccording to his account, Pliny the Elder was then a fleet commander at Misenum - modern day Miseno - across the bay from Pompeii. He took a ship to stage a rescue for those in danger from the volcano.\n\nBut he did not return from the venture.\n\nPliny the Younger, meanwhile, watched the destruction unfold from the other side of the bay.\n\n\"I have faithfully related to you what I was either an eye-witness of myself or received immediately after the accident happened, and before there was time to vary the truth,\" he wrote.\n\nBut the latest discovery calls such certainty into question.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption A simple charcoal scrawl may prove centuries of historical texts wrong\n\nThe inscription discovered in the new excavations is nothing more than a scrawl in charcoal, likely made by a worker renovating a home.\n\nBut it is dated to 16 days before the \"calends\" of November in the old Roman calendar style - which is 17 October in our modern dating method.\n\n\"Since it was done in fragile and evanescent charcoal, which could not have been able to last long, it is highly probable that it can be dated to the October of AD 79,\" the archaeology team said in a statement.\n\nThey believe the most likely date for the eruption was, in fact, 24 October.\n\nThere has long been some speculation that the eruption happened later than August, particularly centred around evidence of autumnal fruits and heating braziers discovered in the ruins.\n\nThe charcoal inscription supports that theory, the Pompeii archaeology team said.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption The latest excavations at Pompeii are uncovering 2,000-year-old works of art\n\nSo did Pliny the Younger record things incorrectly?\n\nHis letter to Tacitus was written some 20 years after the eruption in 79 AD. And the original copies have not survived the intervening 1,939 years.\n\nInstead, our modern reading of the text is based on translations and transcriptions made over the centuries. In fact, various copies of the letters have contained dates ranging anywhere from August to November - though 24 August has long been accepted.\n\nThe differences between the texts could easily have been influenced by confusion over the ancient and modern systems of counting days.\n\nThe discovery was made in the new Regio V excavation, uncovering previously untouched areas of the ancient city.\n\nIn addition to the simple inscription, grand houses have been unveiled this week with elaborate frescoes and mosaics."

    "title": "Why sexual assault survivors forget details",
    "authors": [
      "Linda Geddes"
    ],
    "text": "Barely a week goes by now without another case of rape or historic sex abuse being splashed across the news and picked over by critics. Yet misunderstanding about the nature of sexual violence leads to distorted opinions, which can further enhance victims\u2019 feelings of shame, guilt and self-blame. Common myths about rape and sexual assault also undermine jurors\u2019 ability to objectively assess the facts when such cases come to court.\n\nHere are five common myths and the facts behind them.\n\n1. Most sexual assaults are committed by a stranger\n\n\n\nThe narrative of a woman being sexually assaulted while walking down a dark alleyway may still play out on many TV screens. But in the real world, rape and serious sexual assault is far more likely to occur in the home and at the hands of someone familiar. In England, Wales and Australia, around one in five women have experienced sexual violence at least once during their lifetime; the US\u2019s national sexual violence survey similarly estimated that one in five women, along with one in 71 men, have been raped.\n\nBut in the UK, for example, a separate report found that the perpetrator was a stranger in only 10% of rape and serious sexual assaults, while in 56% of cases it was the victim\u2019s partner, and for the remaining 33% it was a friend, acquaintance, or other family member.\n\n2. A \u2018real\u2019 sexual assault survivor always reports immediately\n\nAccording to UK Home Office data, 46% of recorded rapes were reported on the day they took place \u2013 while 14% of people took more than six months to report that they\u2019d been assaulted. If the victim was a child, they were even more likely to delay coming forward: just 28% of those aged under 16 reported the offence on the day it happened, while a third waited for longer than six months.\n\nThat is just for assaults that ultimately are reported. Many others are not. In the US, for example, studies have estimated that two out of three sexual assaults never are reported.\n\nThere is no evidence that suggests the timing of when you report is linked to the genuineness of the report \u2013 Nicole Westmarland\n\nThere are many reasons why some people either delay reporting or never do, as testified to by the \u201c#WhyIDidn\u2019tReport\u201d hashtag on Twitter. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t report because they don\u2019t want the perpetrator to go to prison: maybe they\u2019re in love with them, or it\u2019s a family member, or it\u2019s a partner and are reliant on their income,\u201d says Nicole Westmarland, director of Durham Centre for Research into Violence and Abuse in the UK. \u201cAnother common reason I hear from students is that they don\u2019t want to ruin the rest of the person\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nEven so, \u201cthere is no evidence that suggests the timing of when you report is linked to the genuineness of the report\", she says.\n\n3. If assaults were reported immediately, it would be relatively easy to investigate and press charges\n\n\n\nIt is true that survivors of rapes and sexual assaults who come forward quickly are more likely to undergo a forensic medical examination, which involves taking swabs and samples from the body to identify the source of any semen, saliva, or DNA. Examiners also document injuries such as cuts, grazes or bruising, which could support allegations of force.\n\nBut undergoing a physical examination doesn\u2019t necessarily mean an offender will be caught and convicted, or even that the case will be investigated \u2013 as demonstrated by the hundreds of thousands of rape kits that sit untested in police departments and forensic storage facilities across the US. And physical evidence tends to be less helpful if the person you\u2019re accusing is a partner or close acquaintance. \u201cMost cases these days don\u2019t come down to whether sexual intercourse happened \u2013 or forensic evidence of intercourse. They come down to whether that intercourse was consensual or not,\u201d says Westmoreland.\n\nIn the US, only 18% of reported rapes lead to an arrest and 2% result in a conviction\n\nAccording to UK Home Office data, 26% of rapes and serious sexual assaults reported on the same day resulted in someone being charged, dropping to 14% once a day or more has elapsed. Those who reported the offence on the day it took place also had significantly higher odds of seeing their case get to court \u2013 although it made less of a difference if the victim was under the age of 16. In the US, meanwhile, separate reports have found that only 18% of reported rapes lead to an arrest and 2% result in a conviction.\n\n4. If you didn\u2019t \u2018really\u2019 want it, you\u2019d fight back\n\n\n\nPeople vary in their response to rape and sexual assault. In her 2008 book, Serial Survivors, the University of Wellington criminologist Jan Jordan describes the very different techniques employed by 15 women who were sexually assaulted by the same man: some tried talking to him; others fought back; still others tried to mentally remove themselves from the situation \u2013 a process psychologists refer to as \u2018dissociation\u2019.\n\nAnother study, which examined 274 police reports from the US, found that only 22% of survivors resisted rape through fighting and screaming. The majority (56%) tried begging and pleading with their offender, while others reported feeling \u2018frozen with fright\u2019. Different scenarios were more or less effective in different circumstances. Women who fought back, for example, were more likely to avoid rape \u2013 but they also ran a higher risk of greater physical injury if a weapon was present. On the other hand, pleading, crying or reasoning with the perpetrator was associated with increased physical injury if the attack took place indoors and increased sexual abuse if environmental intervention (such as someone intruding) occurred.\n\nIt is also important to recognise that people can\u2019t necessarily control their responses in such situations. Some enter a state of involuntary physical paralysis known as \u2018tonic inhibition\u2019 when confronted with an extreme threat. A Swedish study of 298 women who visited an emergency rape clinic within a month of having been sexually assaulted found that 70% reported significant tonic immobility and 48% reported extreme tonic immobility during the assault \u2013 and that those who experienced it were also more likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder and severe depression in the coming months.\n\n5. Traumatic experiences scramble your memories: maybe you\u2019ve misremembered what happened\n\n\n\nMany people who have been raped or sexually assaulted often claim to have vivid memories of certain images, sounds and smells associated with the attack \u2013 even if happened decades earlier. Yet when asked to recall exactly what time of day it was, or who and what was where at any given time \u2013 the kinds of details police and prosecutors often focus on to establish the facts of a crime \u2013 they may struggle or contradict themselves, undermining their testimony.\n\n\u201cThere is this tragic discrepancy between what is expected within the criminal justice system and the nature of trauma memories and how people are likely to be reporting them,\u201d says Amy Hardy, a clinical psychologist at Kings College London.\n\nThere is this tragic discrepancy between what is expected within the criminal justice system and the nature of trauma memories and how people are likely to be reporting them \u2013 Amy Hardy\n\nThis is because memories of traumatic events are laid down differently to everyday memories. Usually we encode what we see, hear, smell, taste and physically sense, as well as how that all slots together and what it means to us \u2013 and together, those different types of information together enable us to recall events as a coherent story. But during traumatic events our bodies are flooded with stress hormones. These encourage the brain to focus on the here and now, at the expense of the bigger picture.\n\nThis makes sense from an evolutionary perspective. \u201cWhen we are under threat, it is much better that we focus on what we are experiencing, which triggers us into fight, flight or freeze-type responses, than to focus on the bigger meaning and making sense of it,\u201d says Hardy. \u201cWe also know that if people dissociate during trauma \u2013 where the cognitive part of the brain shuts down and they go a bit spacey or numb \u2013 it exaggerates this fragmentation process, so their memories have an even more here-and-now-type quality.\u201d\n\nHardy has examined the impact of these memory processes on survivors\u2019 experience of reporting sexual assault to the police. She found that those who reported higher levels of dissociation during the assault perceived their memories to be more fragmented when interviewed by police and that those with greater levels of memory fragmentation were more likely to feel that they had given an incoherent account of what happened. And these factors, in turn, left them less likely to proceed with the legal case.\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

This could push our world beyond its planetary boundaries, which the authors say represent a \"safe operating space for humanity on a stable Earth system\".\n\nHowever the study finds that no single solution will avert the dangers, so a combined approach is needed.\n\nSo when it comes to climate change, the authors looked at what they called a \"flexitarian diet\".\n\n\"We can eat a range of healthy diets but what they all have in common, according to the latest scientific evidence, is that they are all relatively plant based,\" said lead author Dr Marco Springmann from the University of Oxford.\n\n\"You can go from a diet that has small amounts of animal products, some might call it a Mediterranean based diet, we call it a flexitarian diet, over to a pescatarian, vegetarian or vegan diet - we tried to stay with the most conservative one of these which in our view is the flexitarian one, but even this has only one serving of red meat per week.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Improved farming techniques and reduced use of fertiliser will be required\n\nIf the world moved to this type of diet, the study found that greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture would be reduced by more than half.\n\nBut as well as altering diets, the research says that farming practices need to change significantly. This involves boosting yields from existing cropland, improving water management and restricting and recycling fertiliser use.\n\n\"We looked at improving agricultural yields in particular of more health sensitive crops like fruit, vegetables and legumes,\" said Dr Springmann.\n\n\"In the past there has been lots of invest in the stable grains like maize and corn, but now we really need to move it to the crops we need more of. We also looked at increasing the efficiency of water use, and we looked at better monitoring and recycling of fertiliser - lots of it is lost and it runs off into rivers and causes dead zones in the oceans.\"\n\nIn addition, the study found that halving the amount of food lost to waste would reduce the environmental impacts of agriculture by 16%.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Cutting down on food waste will be key to reducing the environmental impacts of farming\n\n\"Tackling food loss and waste will require measures across the entire food chain, from storage, and transport, over food packaging and labelling to changes in legislation and business behaviour that promote zero-waste supply chains,\" said Fabrice de Clerck, director of science at EAT who funded the study.\n\nThe key element is that these three solutions must be implemented together.\n\n\"Feeding a world population of 10 billion people is possible - yet only if we change the way we eat, and the way we produce food,\" said Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, director designate of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who is one of the authors of the study.\n\n\"All measures combined can result in keeping healthy both planet and people.\"\n\nThe study has been published in the journal Nature."

      "Christine Ro"
    ],
    "text": "When her daughter was preschool-aged, Rebecca Spencer experienced something familiar to many parents and childminders: the power of a nap. Without it, her daughter would be giddy, grumpy, or both.\n\nSpencer, a neuroscientist focusing on sleep at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, wanted to investigate the science behind this anecdotal experience. \u201cThe observation of a lot of people is that a napless kid is emotionally dysregulated,\u201d she says. \u201cSo that spurred us to ask this question of, \u2018Do naps actually do something to process emotions?\u2019\u201d\n\nResearch has already shown that, in general, sleep helps us make sense of emotions. Sleep plays a key role in encoding information based on experiences from the day, making sleep critical for preserving memories. And emotional memories are unique because of the way they activate the amygdala, the brain\u2019s emotional core.\n\n\u201cAmygdala activation is what allows your wedding day and the funeral of your parents to be a day better remembered, more than just any other day of work,\u201d Spencer says.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 Why sleep should be every student\u2019s priority\n\n\u2022 Can staying awake beat depression?\n\n\u2022 Why are we all so tired?\n\nThe amygdala tags these memories as significant, so that during sleep they\u2019re processed for longer and reiterated more than more trivial memories. The upshot is that the memories of emotional significance become easier to retrieve in the future.\n\nBut by influencing how memories are processed, sleep can also change the power of a memory itself.\n\n\u201cSleep is particularly good at transforming emotional memory,\u201d says Elaina Bolinger, who specialises in emotion and sleep at the University of Tuebingen.\n\nIn one recent study with eight-to-11-year-olds, Bolinger and colleagues showed children both negative and neutral pictures. The children reported their emotional response using stick figures corresponding to how they felt.\n\nThen some of the children slept. Others did not. The researchers monitored their brain physiology via electrodes from the next room. The next morning, the kids saw the same pictures, plus some new ones. And compared to the children who stayed awake, children who slept were better able to control their emotional responses.\n\nFor instance, the sleepers had a smaller emotional response in late positive potential (LPP). Bolinger describes the LPP as voltage measured at the back of the brain. This fires up whenever the brain is processing information \u2013 and the spikes are especially large when that information is negative emotion. But humans can control the LPP to some extent. As Bolinger puts it, \u201cWe are actively trying to change how we feel about something while we\u2019re perceiving it. So we\u2019re saying, \u2018OK, I am trying to not respond very strongly right now, I want to push down my emotional response.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis research suggests that sleep helps with both crystallising emotional information \u2013 and with controlling how it makes us feel. And this effect works quickly.\n\nA lot of the research is pointing in the direction that a single night of sleep is helpful for processing the memory itself, and for emotional regulation in general \u2013 Elaina Bolinger\n\n\u201cA lot of the research that\u2019s out there right now is pointing in the direction that a single night of sleep is helpful,\u201d says Bolinger. \u201cIt\u2019s helpful for processing the memory itself, and it\u2019s also important for emotional regulation in general.\u201d\n\nBut not all sleep is created equal.\n\nTypes of sleep\n\nRapid eye movement (REM) sleep is associated with emotional memories, and more REM sleep makes people better at assessing others\u2019 emotional intentions and recalling emotional stories. One theory relates to the absence of the stress hormone noradrenaline during REM sleep. Temporarily relieved of this hormone, the brain may use the time to process memories without the stress.\n\nSimon Durrant, who heads the Sleep and Cognition Laboratory at the University of Lincoln, explains another aspect. The prefrontal cortex is the most developed part of the brain \u2013 the location, Durrant says, of the \u201chuman impulse to keep calm and not just react immediately to things\u201d. During wake, this is the part that keeps the amygdala, and thus emotions, in check. During sleep, that connection is reduced. \u201cSo, in a sense, it\u2019s taking the brakes off the emotion during REM sleep,\u201d he says.\n\nScientists have debunked the idea that dreams, which are most emotionally intense during REM sleep, can be meaningfully interpreted. But recent experiences often do turn up in dreams, mainly in the form of emotional content rather than a replay of events. Durrant says that there\u2019s tentative evidence \u201cthat what occurs more in dreams is also what is remembered more\u201d.\n\nThe process has been investigated by pioneering sleep researcher Rosalind Cartwright. Cartwright\u2019s theory is that during dreams, distressing real-life experiences are integrated with similar memories. Thus, dreamers are better able to contextualise painful new memories against more settled ones, removing the sting.\n\nBut Spencer believes that non-REM sleep also plays a role. Slow-wave sleep (SWS) is the first phase of sleep that consolidates memories, and is especially good for processing neutral memories. Spencer\u2019s research suggests that the amount of SWS activity during sleep affects how emotional memories are transformed.\n\nKids are really emotional without naps, and they\u2019re hypersensitive to emotional stimuli \u2013 Rebecca Spencer\n\nNaps mostly consist of non-REM sleep \u2013 including SWS in longer naps. And a recent paper co-authored by Spencer appears to be the first to show that naps, and not just overnight sleep, contribute to emotional memory processing in children. Without a nap, children showed a bias toward emotional faces. With a nap, they exhibited what Spencer calls the \"cool as a cucumber\" effect, where they responded similarly to neutral stimuli as to emotional stimuli. In essence, \u201ckids are really emotional without naps, and they\u2019re hypersensitive to emotional stimuli\u201d, she says \u2013 because they haven\u2019t consolidated the emotional baggage from earlier that day.\n\nSpencer believes that naps are also helpful for emotional processing in adults, though not to the same extent. An adult has a more mature hippocampus, and thus a stronger ability to hold onto memories. Wake isn\u2019t as damaging.\n\nThat\u2019s only up to a point, though. Spencer\u2019s ageing-related research suggests that \u201cyou need to more frequently consolidate memories as you get older, because you could have a similar degeneration of hippocampus storage with ageing\u201d.\n\nInterestingly, older adults show a bias towards positive memories while young adults skew negative. That may be because it\u2019s adaptive for children and teenagers to focus on negative experiences, because that contains key information that needs to be learned: from the dangers of fire to the risks of accepting a drink from a stranger. But towards the end of life, people prioritise the positives. They also get less REM sleep \u2013 the kind of sleep most likely to entrench negative memories, especially in people with depression.\n\nTherapeutic uses\n\nFor individuals without disordered sleep, Bolinger says that the cortical integration function of sleep \u201cgets stronger with time. So that first night of sleep puts you at an advantage for emotional processing down the road.\"\n\nOne study suggests that sleeping within 24 hours of a traumatic experience will make those memories less distressing\n\nSleep researchers are also looking at the potential of certain facets of sleep, such as lucid dreaming, to treat post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). One study suggests that sleeping within 24 hours of a traumatic experience will make those memories less distressing in the subsequent days. For people with anxiety, sleep therapy might help with reminding people that they\u2019ve eliminated their fear.\n\nBut while people with typical cognitive patterns need sleep to recover from intense experiences, it may be different for those with depression.\n\nWake therapy, where people are deliberately deprived of sleep, is spreading as a method of treating depression. It doesn\u2019t work in all cases. But it may be that it jolts the circadian system, which is prone to sluggishness in people with depression.\n\nSleeplessness in some cases may have a protective effect. Spencer points out that following intense trauma, \u201cthe natural biological response in those conditions is that we have insomnia\u201d. This may be an appropriate response to an unusual situation.\n\nSo sometimes it can actually be a good thing that REM sleep deprivation harms the brain\u2019s ability to consolidate emotional memories. \u201cThere\u2019s good evidence that people who have longer REM sleep tend to be more depressed,\u201d Durrant says. He believes that this is because a subset of people with depression are re-consolidating negative memories during REM sleep.\n\nWhy does sleeplessness help the emotional state of some people with depression and trauma, but not others? New work by Durrant and colleagues suggests that the difference may come down to genetics. A particular gene, called the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene, appears key to memory consolidation during sleep.\n\nPeople with a specific gene mutation are vulnerable to the frequent, unhelpful circling of negative memories during sleep \u2013 for them, it could be helpful to go to sleep early and get up very early\n\nAnd the new research suggests that people who have a specific mutation of the BDNF gene are vulnerable to the frequent, unhelpful circling of negative memories during sleep. For them, it could be helpful to go to sleep early and get up very early to minimise the amount of REM sleep. For the same reason, Durrant would also recommend an afternoon nap.\n\n\u201cI don't think we\u2019re going to solve this even in my lifetime,\u201d says Spencer of all the potential clinical applications of sleep and wake therapy. But what\u2019s clear is that certain kinds of decision-making improve following sleep, partly because of the way sleep regulates all those swirling feelings.\n\nBolinger puts it plainly: for the most part, \u201csleep helps you feel better\u201d.\n\nUltimately, the best prescription for a broken heart or a clouded mind may be having a kip.\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

He worked for a pickled cucumber company \u2013 aged nine\n\nNile maintains a fearsome schedule today, and his work ethic began at a very early age. \u201cI was always a hard worker,\u201d he says. \u201cI read this book by Harpo Marx\u2026 and I remember him getting a job at nine years old. And when I read that I was like \u2018wow, I\u2019ve got to go get a job\u2019. I worked for Guss, the pickle king. His motto was \u2018You can turn a cucumber into a pickle, but you can\u2019t turn a pickle back into a cucumber\u2019. And I was like\u2026 \u2018all right Guss!'\u201d\n\n3. His stepfather was cool \u2013 even when disciplining young Nile\n\nNile grew up with his mother, who was just 14 when he was born, and his stepfather. They were both heroin addicts, but Nile admired their Beatnik style and openness to new art and ideas. Nile once accidentally started a fire at home, and still remembers his stepfather\u2019s reprimand: \u201cHe just stared at me for ten minutes and said, \u2018Dig yourself man. Look into yourself man, y\u2019know, be responsible\u2019... That\u2019s how cool my parents were.\u201d\n\n4. Are You Experienced by Jimi Hendrix was a deeply formative influence\n\nAs a teenager, Nile was inspired by one of the most original guitarists of the 1960s: \u201cI remember when I first heard Hendrix play the album Are You Experienced. It was just the most important piece of music to me of all time \u2013 for about two or three weeks! But it\u2019s still cool. The lyrics, and the way he played \u2013 this really made me who I am.\u201d The title track is Nile\u2019s fourth choice of disc."

    "title": "Why more women don\u2019t win Nobel prizes in science",
    "authors": [
      "Mary K Feeney"
    ],
    "text": "One of the 2018 Nobel prizes in physics went to Donna Strickland, a major accomplishment for any scientist. Yet much of the news coverage has focused on the fact that she\u2019s only the third female physicist to receive the award, after Marie Curie in 1903 and Maria Goeppert-Mayer 60 years later.\n\nThough biochemical engineer Frances Arnold also won this year, for chemistry, the rarity of female Nobel laureates raises questions about women\u2019s exclusion from education and careers in science. Female researchers have come a long way over the past century. But there\u2019s overwhelming evidence that women remain underrepresented in the Stem fields of science, technology, engineering and math.\n\nStudies have shown those who persist in these careers face explicit and implicit barriers to advancement. Bias is most intense in fields that are predominantly male, where women lack a critical mass of representation and are often viewed as tokens or outsiders.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 How many female scientists can you name?\n\n\u2022 The case for renaming women\u2019s body parts\n\n\u2022 Nobel prizes: Is there a secret formula to winning one?\n\nWhen women achieve at the highest levels of sports, politics, medicine and science, they serve as role models for all of us, especially for girls and other women. But are things getting better in terms of equal representation? And what still holds women back in the classroom, in the lab, in leadership and as award winners?\n\nSpecious stereotypes\n\nTraditional stereotypes hold that women \u2018don\u2019t like math\u2019 and \u2018aren\u2019t good at science\u2019. Both men and women report these viewpoints \u2013 but researchers have empirically disputed them. Studies show that girls and women avoid Stem education not because of cognitive inability, but because of early exposure and experience with Stem, educational policy, cultural context, stereotypes and a lack of exposure to role models.\n\nFor the past several decades, efforts to improve the representation of women in Stem fields have focused on countering these stereotypes with educational reforms and individual programmes that can increase the number of girls entering and staying in what\u2019s been called the Stem pipeline \u2013 the path from primary and secondary school to university to postgraduate training.\n\nWomen earn about 18% of PhDs in physics, an increase from 1975 when women earned 5% of PhDs in physics\n\nThese approaches are working. Women are increasingly likely to express an interest in Stem careers and pursue Stem majors in university. Women now make up half or more of workers in psychology and social sciences and are increasingly represented in the scientific workforce, though computer and mathematical sciences are an exception. According to the American Institute of Physics, women earn about 20% of bachelor\u2019s degrees and 18% of PhDs in physics, an increase from 1975 when women earned 10% of bachelor\u2019s degrees and 5% of PhDs in physics.\n\nMore women are graduating with Stem PhDs and earning faculty positions. But they go on to encounter glass cliffs and ceilings as they advance through their academic careers.\n\nStem ceiling\n\n\n\nWomen face a number of structural and institutional barriers in academic Stem careers.\n\nIn addition to issues related to the gender pay gap, the structure of academic science often makes it difficult for women to get ahead in the workplace and to balance work and life commitments. Bench science can require years of dedicated time in a laboratory. The strictures of the tenure-track process can make maintaining work-life balance, responding to family obligations, and having children or taking family leave difficult, if not impossible.\n\nAdditionally, working in male-dominated workplaces can leave women feeling isolated, perceived as tokens and susceptible to harassment. Women often are excluded from networking opportunities and social events and left to feel they\u2019re outside the culture of the lab, the academic department and the field.\n\nWhen women lack critical mass \u2013 of about 15% or more \u2013 they are less empowered to advocate for themselves and more likely to be perceived as a minority group and an exception\n\nWhen women lack critical mass \u2013 of about 15% or more \u2013 they are less empowered to advocate for themselves and more likely to be perceived as a minority group and an exception. When in this minority position, women are more likely to be pressured to take on extra service as \u2018tokens\u2019 on committees or as mentors to female graduate students.\n\nWith fewer female colleagues, women are less likely to build relationships with female collaborators and support and advice networks. This isolation can be exacerbated when women are unable to participate in work events or attend conferences because of family or child care responsibilities and an inability to use research funds to reimburse child care.\n\nUniversities, professional associations, and federal funders have worked to address a variety of these structural barriers. Efforts include creating family-friendly policies, increasing transparency in salary reporting, enforcing Title IX protections in the US, providing mentoring and support programmes for women scientists, protecting research time for women scientists, and targeting women for hiring, research support and advancement.\n\nThese programmes have mixed results. For example, research indicates that family-friendly policies such as leave and onsite child care can exacerbate gender inequity, resulting in increased research productivity for men and increased teaching and service obligations for women.\n\nAll of us \u2013 the general public, the media, university employees, students and professors \u2013 have ideas of what a scientist and a Nobel Prize winner looks like. That image is predominantly male, white and older \u2013 which makes sense given 97% of the science Nobel Prize winners have been men. (It isn't just science: BBC Future recently created a composite face of all the members of the US Congress. You can see it here).\n\nThis is an example of an implicit bias: one of the unconscious, involuntary, natural, unavoidable assumptions that all of us, men and women, form about the world around us. People make decisions based on subconscious assumptions, preferences and stereotypes \u2013 sometimes even when they are counter to their explicitly held beliefs.\n\nWomen seeking academic jobs are more likely to be viewed and judged based on personal information and physical appearance\n\nResearch shows that an implicit bias against women as experts and academic scientists is pervasive. It manifests itself by valuing, acknowledging and rewarding men\u2019s scholarship over women\u2019s scholarship. Implicit bias can work against women\u2019s hiring, advancement and recognition of their work. For instance, women seeking academic jobs are more likely to be viewed and judged based on personal information and physical appearance. Letters of recommendation for women are more likely to raise doubts and use language that results in negative career outcomes.\n\nImplicit bias can affect women\u2019s ability to publish research findings and gain recognition for that work. Men cite their own papers 56% more than women do. Known as the \u201cMatilda Effect\u201d, there is a gender gap in recognition, award winning and citations. Women\u2019s research is less likely to be cited by others and their ideas are more likely to be attributed to men. Women\u2019s solo-authored research takes twice as long to move through the review process. Women are underrepresented in journal editorships, as senior scholars and lead authors, and as peer reviewers. This marginalisation in research gatekeeping positions works against the promotion of women\u2019s research.\n\nWhen a woman becomes a world-class scientist, implicit bias works against the likelihood that she will be invited as a keynote or guest speaker to share her research findings, thus lowering her visibility in the field and the likelihood that she will be nominated for awards. This gender imbalance is notable in how infrequently women experts are quoted in news stories on most topics.\n\nWomen scientists are afforded less of the respect and recognition that should come with their accomplishments. Research shows that when people talk about male scientists and experts, they\u2019re more likely to use their surnames and more likely to refer to women by their first names. Why does this matter? Because experiments show that individuals referred to by their surnames are more likely to be viewed as famous and eminent. In fact, one study found that calling scientists by their last names led people to consider them 14% more deserving of a National Science Foundation career award.\n\nStrickland winning a Nobel Prize as an associate professor in physics is a major accomplishment; doing so as a woman who has almost certainly faced more barriers than her male counterparts is, in my view, monumental.\n\nWhen asked what it felt like to be the third female Nobel laureate in physics, Strickland noted that at first it was surprising to realise so few women had won the award. \u201cBut, I mean, I do live in a world of mostly men, so seeing mostly men doesn\u2019t really ever surprise me either,\u201d she said.\n\nSeeing mostly men has been the history of science. Addressing structural and implicit bias in Stem will hopefully prevent another half-century wait before the next woman is acknowledged with a Nobel Prize for her contribution to physics. I look forward to the day when a woman receiving the most prestigious award in science is newsworthy only for her science and not her gender.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Conversation, and is republished under a Creative Commons licence.\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

Long or short? Fitted or puffy?\n\nBut for Princess Eugenie there was an extra factor at play.\n\nThe Queen's granddaughter had major surgery on her back to treat a curvature of the spine at the age of 12.\n\nSixteen years on, and the princess chose to wear a wedding dress that showed her scar, saying she hoped it would honour those who had helped her and inspire others with the condition of scoliosis.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption The dress was designed by British-based Peter Pilotto and Christopher De Vos\n\n'I think you can change the way beauty is'\n\nAhead of the wedding, the princess spoke of the importance of showing \"people your scars\".\n\nAnd earlier this year she revealed for the first time her own X-rays from when she was treated for scoliosis as a child.\n\n\"I had an operation when I was 12 on my back, and you'll see on Friday [at the wedding], but it's a lovely way to honour the people who looked after me and a way of standing up for young people who also go through this,\" she told ITV's This Morning.\n\n\"I think you can change the way beauty is, and you can show people your scars and I think it's really special to stand up for that.\"\n\nWhat is scoliosis and why does it mostly affect young girls?\n\nScoliosis is a condition that causes the spine to bend to one side, making the back appear rounded and shoulder blades stick out.\n\nIt most often starts in children aged 10 to 15 but there is often no known cause. Sometimes it is caused by the bones not forming properly in the womb or other medical conditions, including cerebral palsy.\n\nThree to four children in 1,000 need treatment from a specialist.\n\nThe Scoliosis Association UK says about five out of six people with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis are female - but it is not known why.\n\nIn Princess Eugenie's case, it required corrective surgery and she had the operation at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital.\n\nThe princess, now 28, has previously spoken of how she felt in the weeks before her surgery, saying it was \"a scary prospect for a 12-year-old; I can still vividly remember how nervous I felt\".\n\n\"During my operation, which took eight hours, my surgeons inserted eight-inch titanium rods into each side of my spine and one-and-a-half inch screws at the top of my neck. After three days in intensive care, I spent a week on a ward and six days in a wheelchair, but I was walking again after that,\" she says in her story on the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital's website.\n\n'I thought I'd be in a wheelchair by 30'\n\nTrainee teacher Camilla Seckin also had surgery for the condition at the same hospital.\n\n\"I was really terrified and really in denial about having the surgery, but I knew it was something that I had to get done.\n\n\"At this point my back was at a 72-degree curvature and the prognosis was that I'd be in a wheel chair by the age of 30.\n\n\"I felt very insecure about my appearance but I feel confident now and I'm not ashamed of having the condition.\"\n\nCamilla encourages sufferers to speak up \"as it can be quite lonely if you don't\".\n\n\"Building a network with people who have had the surgery has really helped me. I can still do things despite my condition.\"\n\n'Eugenie can inspire others who are affected'\n\nImage copyright Rex/Shutterstock\n\nJan Lehovsky, a spinal surgeon who was part of the team who operated on the princess, said: \"Most of the patients affected by scoliosis are young girls and she's a real role model for them.\n\n\"She's someone who can inspire them, which is so important for the young ladies coming through the surgery.\""

It must have squeezed through a wall cavity and there is a hole at the back of the oven so it was probably attracted by the warmth.\n\n\"It was lucky the couple didn't preheat the oven first.\"\n\nAfrican brown snakes are frequently found in homes in Africa and eat rodents, small lizards and birds."

Say what feels natural: The important thing is that you are not apologetic in your response. Don't engage: Harassers may try to argue with you or dismiss you through further conversation or by making fun of you. As tempting as it may be get into a verbal war with them, it is not recommended. The attention may further feed their abusive behaviour. Keep moving: Once you've said your piece, keep moving. Harassers do not deserve the pleasure of your company.\n\nThe charity is calling on the government to recognise street harassment as a type of \"gender-based violence\".\n\nIt has made several recommendations, including:\n\nPublic awareness campaigns to spread the message that street harassment \"is not OK\"\n\nOffer training for bystanders on how to safely intervene\n\nSupport boys and men to change their attitudes and challenge harassment\n\nProvide relationship and sex education to young people\n\nTraining for workers in public places (shop staff, bus drivers) on spotting harassment and reporting it\n\nThe chief executive of Plan International UK, Tanya Barron, said it was \"shocking and deeply concerning\" that girls who are clearly of school age are being sexually harassed.\n\n\"It's simply not acceptable that girls as young as 12 are being wolf-whistled at in public, touched against their will, stared at or even followed,\" she said.\n\n\"This disgraceful behaviour needs to be called out and stopped.\""

    "text": "They're the Beatles for the 21st Century, a global pop sensation that generates mania and devotion in equal measure, and they've sold out London's O2 Arena.\n\nBTS, the South Korean seven-member boyband and pin-up stars of the K-pop genre, are performing in the UK for two nights only.\n\nAnd their fans, who call themselves the Army, are over the Moon. We headed for the queues to find out what makes the perfect K-pop fan.\n\n1. The chants\n\nImage caption K-pop is like going down a rabbit-hole into Korean culture, says Najma Akther, pictured right\n\nDon't know the chants? Then, jog on. Before the boys put a boxfresh trainer-clad foot on to the stage, the Army will be in full swing with their chants.\n\nQueue buddies Bianca, 16, from Poland, and Ella, 17, from Ipswich, shyly give us a demonstration, and it's oddly mesmerising.\n\nIt's a synchronised list of the boys' names, surnames included.\n\nFans talk about how regularly listening to BTS, who mostly sing in Korean, has meant they are inadvertently learning Korean.\n\n\"You quite quickly become engrossed in Korean culture,\" says 24-year-old Najma Akther, from Scunthorpe.\n\n\"It's like going down a rabbit-hole. I watch K-dramas (Korean TV shows) because of the great visuals and great acting - it's helping me learn Korean. I've only been watching them for a year so I'm not fluent yet.\"\n\n2. The dance moves\n\nImage copyright GOINGMERRY12HO Image caption --\n\nTricky. The band famously spend days learning the routines. They're tightly choreographed and high intensity, and not ones that fans are willing to demonstrate to us in public.\n\nMost practise in their bedrooms, but the talented will post videos of their moves online.\n\n3. The light sticks\n\nAlmost a non-negotiable that'll cost you \u00a345. It's a BTS-branded, Bluetooth-connected orb which will change colour in sync with the on-stage light show. No old ones or your own version allowed. They are part of the K-pop world and, to one young fan, \"they bring us all together\". Another is less enthused - \"they're extortionate\".\n\nImage copyright GOINGMERRY12HO Image caption BTS made history by becoming the first Korean musicians to perform in a US stadium\n\nWho are BTS?\n\nBTS, also known as Beyond the Scene and the Bangtan Boys, were founded by Big Hit Entertainment and made their debut in 2013\n\nThey are Jin, SUGA, j-hope, RM, Jimin, V and Jung Kook, and are all in their early 20s\n\nTheir performances mix pop, R&B, hip hop and feature tightly choreographed dance routines\n\nHits include DNA - performed at the 2017 American Music Awards, poignant youth anthem Blood Sweat & Tears, and Spring Day, which many fans view as a tribute to the 2014 Sewol ferry disaster in South Korea\n\nThey are record breakers: They beat Harry Styles with the most Twitter engagements in one day and got more YouTube views of their single, Idol, than Taylor Swift's record (they got 45 million views in 24 hours)\n\nAnd, when they topped the US Billboard 200 album chart with new album Love Yourself, South Korea's president congratulated the boys on Twitter:\n\n4. Throwing things\n\nDon't. The lights may be bright, the screams piercing, the heat rising and your senses overloaded but that's still no reason to fling your teddy bear, programme or pictures of yourself at the band.\n\nFan Megan Spence, 21, from Dublin, knows people get overexcited and don't mean to cause harm but worries it's giving the fans a bad name.\n\nThe problem is bad enough that the O2 makes a point of telling concert-goers not to throw stuff.\n\nIf you forget, the band members will be there on stage to remind you - be kind, be respectful, love yourself and one another.\n\n5. Fan projects\n\nImage caption Cecilia Skram and her mum, Vivian Nielsen, love the band's positive message to accept yourself for who you are\n\nIt's not enough to just watch and listen, you've got to get involved. And their fans do - in droves.\n\nThere are fan sites, spaces for translations (the band have had top 10 hits in about 70 countries) and philanthropy projects to raise money for BTS's chosen charities.\n\nEven their mums are getting in on the act. Vivian Nielsen, 43, from Oslo, has set up an online community for Army mums. Her 18-year-old daughter, Cecilia Skram, introduced her to the band. \"They focus on loving yourself and accepting yourself for who you are - and they talk about social issues,\" says Cecilia.\n\nIt's a powerful message among their young fans, and one that appeals to Cecilia's mum too.\n\n\"There's not a lot of controversial things involved,\" she says. \"They behave. Onstage there's a bit of thrusting, some moves are questionable but the lyrics are safe.\"\n\n6. Devotion\n\nChisa, a 28-year-old office worker from Osaka, has seen BTS once, in Japan. \"They were fantastic. 100 out of 10,\" she says.\n\nDesperate to see them again, she tried to buy an O2 ticket but missed out. So, she spent nearly \u00a3900 on a flight to the UK just so she could \"feel the atmosphere\" in the build-up to the concert. Now that's devotion."

    "authors": [
      "Fiona Macdonald"
    ],
    "text": "It is the ultimate peace anthem; an ode to idealism. But Imagine is also a song about love. When it was composed, in 1971, John Lennon and Yoko Ono had been together for three years. She was lambasted by some as the \u2018dragon lady\u2019 who had broken up Lennon's marriage to Cynthia \u2013 and, in the process, The Beatles. Yet, as a new book from Thames & Hudson suggests, Ono was misrepresented \u2013 even when it came to being credited for a song\u2019s creation. In a 1980 interview reprinted in Imagine John Yoko, Lennon admits that Ono was equally responsible for Imagine; in 2017, Ono was formally recognised as co-writer of the iconic song.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- The music played to drown out a war\n\n- When music is a weapon\n\n- Can data reveal the saddest song ever?\n\nAs the book shows, through a collection of rarely seen photos and archive interviews along with insider accounts detailing the making of the album, Lennon and Ono inspired each other from their first meeting.\n\nI always had this dream of meeting an artist woman I would fall in love with \u2013 John Lennon\n\nIn 1966, Lennon went to a preview of Ono\u2019s show at the Indica gallery in London, and wanted to contribute to a piece called Hammer a Nail in. But Ono was reluctant to let him, as she recalls in an archive interview in the book. \u201cI said, \u2018All right, if he pays five shillings, it\u2019s okay,\u2019 because I decided that my painting will never sell anyway.\u201d\n\nLennon had another idea, adding in the interview: \u201cI said, \u2018Listen I\u2019ll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in, is that okay?\u2019 And her whole trip is this: \u2018Imagine this, imagine that.\u2019\u201d\n\nOno replies: \u201cImagine, imagine. So I was thinking, \u2018Oh, here\u2019s a guy who\u2019s playing the same game I\u2019m playing.\u2019 And I was really shocked you know, I thought, \u2018Who is it?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t recognise Lennon. \u201cI heard about The Beatles and I knew the name Ringo, and nobody\u2019s going to believe me but still that\u2019s exactly how it was. Ringo hit me because Ringo is \u2018apple\u2019 in Japanese. Yes, I knew The Beatles as a social phenomenon, but rock \u2018n\u2019 roll had passed me by.\u201d\n\nBlank canvas\n\nOno offered Lennon a way back into art. \u201cI always had this dream of meeting an artist woman I would fall in love with. Even from art school\u2026 It was like finding gold or something.\u201d Seeing her show unlocked something in him. \u201cThere was a sense of humour in her work, you know? It was funny,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cHer work really made me laugh, some of it. So that\u2019s when I got interested in art again, just through her work.\u201d\n\nOne 1964 work, in particular, would help to create Imagine. Yoko\u2019s book Grapefruit includes several \u2018event scores\u2019 that went on to influence Lennon. They feature the lines \u201cImagine the clouds dripping, dig a hole in your garden to put them in.\u201d (Cloud Piece); \u201cImagine letting a goldfish swim across the sky\u201d (Drinking Piece for Orchestra); \u201cImagine one thousand suns in the sky at the same time.\u201d (Tunafish Sandwich Piece).\n\nLennon acknowledged that debt. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pieces in it saying like \u2018imagine this\u2019 or \u2018imagine that\u2019,\u201d he said about Grapefruit. \u201cImagine could never have been written without her. And I know she helped on a lot of the lyrics but I wasn\u2019t man enough to let her have credit for it. So that song was actually written by John and Yoko, but I was still selfish enough and unaware enough to take her contribution without acknowledging it. The song itself expresses what I\u2019d learned through being with Yoko and my own feelings on it. It should really have said \u2018Lennon/Ono\u2019 on that song, because she contributed to a lot of that song.\u201d\n\nIn the book, Ono reveals how they had to face a negative reaction as a couple, despite what appeared to be a radical, free-thinking culture in London. \u201cThey exuded new energy with a certain elegance of self-made people who would change the class structure in England, and would go on to change the world in a big way,\u201d she said. \u201cJohn and I got together in that atmosphere. So we were very surprised that the so-called hip society of the times, to which we both belonged, turned against us as soon as we announced our unity\u2026 their hipness ended at the point where John, their ringleader, chose an Oriental woman as his partner.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t realise there was so much racism\u2026 I would not say it was easy, but it was an education for us. A good experience. We always tried to deal with a lot of difficult situations, John and I, with a bit of a sense of humour and a sense of fun.\u201d\n\nOno recognised this was also a part of Imagine. \u201cJohn and I met \u2013 he comes from the West and I come from the East \u2013 and still we are together,\u201d she said in 1980. \u201cWe have this oneness and \u2018the whole world would eventually become one\u2019 is the sense that we will all be caf\u00e9-au-lait colour and we will all be very happy together.\u201d\n\nWe were trying to create a more positive image, which is, of course, gonna set up another kind of society \u2013 Yoko Ono\n\nThe song, in a way, deals with imagining another world on the level of two people \u2013 as well as in a larger sense. \u201cGeorge Orwell and all these guys have projected very negative views of the future. And imagining a projection is a very strong magic power,\u201d said Ono. \u201cI mean that. That\u2019s the way society was created. And so, because they\u2019re setting up all these negative images, that\u2019s gonna create the society. So we were trying to create a more positive image, which is, of course, gonna set up another kind of society.\u201d\n\nLennon referenced humans\u2019 desire to fly \u2013 \u201cwhich might\u2019ve taken us a long time, but it took somebody to imagine it first\u201d. He explained his reasoning. \u201cPeople said, \u2018You\u2019re naive, you\u2019re dumb, you\u2019re stupid.\u2019 It might have hurt us on a personal level to be called names, but what we were doing \u2013 you can call it magic, meditation, projection of goal \u2013 which business people do, they have courses on it. The footballers do it. They pray, they meditate before the game\u2026 People project their own future. So, what we wanted to do was to say, \u2018Let\u2019s imagine a nice future.\u2019\u201d\n\nOno describes how they felt about Imagine at the time: \u201cWe both liked the song a lot but we honestly didn\u2019t realise it would turn into the powerful song it has, all over the world\u2026 We just did it because we believed in the words and it just reflected how we were feeling.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lennon, \u201cMy greatest pleasure is writing a song \u2013 words and lyrics \u2013 that will last longer than a couple of years. Songs that anybody could sing. Songs that will outlive me, probably. And that gives me my greatest pleasure. That\u2019s where I get my kicks.\u201d\n\nImagine John Yoko is out now, published by Thames & Hudson.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nDid you know that every time you do your washing you could be contributing to the world's plastic problem?\n\nTake a look at your clothes labels. If they contain some sort of man-made fibres then studies show your clothes wash could be threatening the world's seas.\n\nBut there are ways of reducing the damage. Here are some of the options.\n\nWhat's the issue?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A polyester fleece can release 1,000,000 fibres per wash\n\nWhen you do laundry, synthetic clothes shed tiny threads which end up in the water - about 700,000 fibres in a single domestic wash.\n\nLess than a millimetre in length, the microfibres then make their way into the waterways and seas.\n\nThe worst offenders are polyester, acrylic and nylon.\n\nA polyester fleece jacket releases 1,000,000 fibres per wash, according to one study, while a pair of nylon socks is responsible for 136,000 fibres.\n\nScientists from the University of Manchester found those fibres are littering riverbeds across the UK.\n\nResearch highlighted by MPs this week shows they end up being eaten by fish and other aquatic creatures, ultimately ending up in the food chain.\n\nEarlier this year, scientists found fibres, including strands of underwear, in every sample of mussels they tested in British seawaters or bought from UK supermarkets.\n\nAnother study, from the University of Exeter, found microfibres in the environment altered animals' behaviour.\n\nIs there anything I can do?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Filling up your washing machine could reduce the damage\n\nWell if you've always hated laundry, here's your excuse not to do it. Otherwise, there are some changes you can make:\n\nWash at a low temperature. Higher temperatures result in more fibres being released.\n\nFill up your washing machine. Washing a full load results in fewer fibres being released as there is less friction.\n\nAim for shorter washes - again this reduces the friction between fabrics.\n\nUse washing liquid instead of powder. The grains of the powder can result in loosening the fibres.\n\nSpin clothes at lower speeds to reduce chances of fibres loosening.\n\nAvoid using detergents with a high pH and oxidizing agents. Some fabric softeners also help to reduce friction.\n\nThere is, of course, the option of washing your clothes less frequently.\n\nThat would have the biggest impact, says Jeroen Dagevos, from ocean conservation project Plastic Soup Foundation.\n\nHe also suggests buying fewer synthetic clothes, instead buying natural fabrics such as wool, cotton, linen, silk or cashmere.\n\nImage copyright J Woodward Image caption Some parts of the River Tame contained more than half a million plastic particles per square metre of riverbed\n\nAnother option, recommended by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in a new report, is the use of mesh laundry bags to catch threads - which can then be put in the bin.\n\nFilters for washing machine waste pipes have also been developed, which can catch at least 80% of the fibres before they disappear down the drain.\n\nThere are also laundry balls on the market, which claim to \"attract\" fibres to stick them, instead of flowing out of your machine with the water.\n\nCan the industry do more?\n\nYes, much more, according to Mr Dagevos, who says the size and scale of the problem is only just starting to be realised.\n\n\"It is much bigger than microbeads and much more complex to tackle,\" he added.\n\nMicrobeads, found in products such as face scrubs, toothpastes and shower gels, have already been banned in the UK.\n\nAurelie Hulse, lead author of report Engineering Out Fashion Waste, says fabrics should be designed not to shed microfibres when they are washed.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Some of the plastic found in the ocean has come from clothing, scientists say\n\nOcean Clean Wash, a campaign initiated by Plastic Soup Foundation, found that changing the design of fibres, such as length and density, could affect how many are released.\n\nAdding a natural anti-shed treatment to fabrics was also shown to make a difference.\n\nMr Dagevos says bringing in new regulations for manufacturers could help by forcing companies to put more resources into finding solutions."

    "title": "The surprising truth about loneliness",
    "authors": [
      "Claudia Hammond"
    ],
    "text": "1. Younger people feel lonelier than older people\n\nAbout the results The findings in this article are based on an online survey of 55,000 people from around the world, called the BBC Loneliness Experiment. It was created by academics at three British universities in collaboration with Wellcome Collection. Find out more: The Anatomy of Loneliness\n\nWhen you picture someone who\u2019s lonely, the stereotype is often an older person who lives alone and hardly sees anyone. Indeed, in the BBC Loneliness Experiment, 27% of over 75s said they often or very often feel lonely. This is higher than in some surveys, but because the survey was online we had a self-selecting sample and might have attracted more people who feel lonely.\n\nYet the differences between age groups are striking. Levels of loneliness were actually highest among 16-24 year olds, with 40% saying they often or very often feel lonely.\n\nThis begs the question of why so many young people say they feel lonely. Perhaps they are more prepared to admit to feelings of loneliness than older people who might feel they need to stress their independence. But it was noticeable that when everyone was asked at which point in their life they\u2019d felt lonely, even retrospectively the most common answer people gave was when they were young adults.\n\nSo it\u2019s not necessarily modern life that\u2019s making young people feel lonelier, but factors associated with being young itself. Although we might think of the ages of 16-24 as a time of new freedom to have fun, leaving school and having more control over your life, it\u2019s also a time of transition \u2013 moving away from home, starting college, starting a new job \u2013 all of which take you away from the friends you\u2019ve grown up with. At the same time people are trying to work out who they are and where they fit into the world.\n\nIn addition to this, people aren\u2019t accustomed to these feelings of loneliness and haven\u2019t yet had the experience to know that they often pass, or to the chance to find ways to cope with those feelings, such as distracting themselves or looking for company.\n\n2. 41% of people think loneliness can be positive\n\nThis finding fits in with the ideas of people such as the late neuroscientist John Cacioppo, who believed that we evolved to experience loneliness because it can be useful, even though it\u2019s so unpleasant. Humans have survived through forming co-operative groups. If people feel they are excluded from a group then feelings of loneliness might drive them to connect with people, finding new friends or rekindling old relationships.\n\nThe problem is that it can become chronic, with a serious impact on well-being and maybe even on health. This animation, which we published at the start of the project, explains more:\n\nFeelings of chronic loneliness are associated with an increased risk of depression a year later. It was striking that in the survey, although 41% of all the participants said loneliness could be positive, this rate dropped to 31% in those who told us they often feel lonely. Loneliness can be so miserable and distressing, that when it\u2019s long-lasting it can be hard to see any positive side.\n\n3. People who feel lonely have social skills that are no better or worse than average\n\nSometimes it\u2019s assumed that people feel lonely because they\u2019ve found it hard to make friends and help with improving social skills would make a difference. This isn\u2019t what we found. A key element of social interaction is the ability to tell what other people are feeling, so that you can adjust your responses accordingly. Perhaps they\u2019re worried about something or you\u2019ve accidentally offended them.\n\nOne way of measuring this skill is to give people a series of full faces or even just pairs of eyes to assess how good they are at working out which emotion people are experiencing. There was no difference between the average scores of the people who often felt lonely and the people who didn\u2019t. There were differences in scores on neuroticism, so perhaps it\u2019s the anxiety provoked by social situations that can make them harder to cope with if you feel lonely, rather than social skills.\n\n4. Winter is no lonelier than any other time of year\n\nIn the run-up to Christmas, you often see campaigns from charities who help the elderly featuring picture of isolated old people. It\u2019s a day of the year that\u2019s all about gathering with your loved ones to celebrate, so the idea of facing the day alone is something a lot of people would dread. British comedian Sarah Millican runs a very successful #joinin campaign on Twitter on Christmas Day so that people who feel lonely can chat to each other. And if you live in the northern hemisphere then Christmas also falls in the middle of winter when days are shortest and people stay in more, leaving you even more isolated if you feel lonely.\n\nBut we found that for many who feel lonely, winter is no worse than any other time of year. We asked people to tell us the time of year and the time of day when they felt loneliest. More than two thirds of people said winter was no lonelier than any other time of year. The minority of people who did say one particular time of year is lonelier chose winter, but a few even chose summer. At Christmas, many people go to great lengths to ensure that everyone is included, inviting friends over if they know they might be alone. But in summer if everyone else goes on holiday, you might be the one feeling left behind. So perhaps we should start wondering whether other people might be lonely all year round, instead of just at Christmas.\n\n5. People who often feel lonely have higher levels of empathy than everyone else\n\nIn the survey two kinds of empathy were measured. One was empathy for people\u2019s physical pain \u2013 how sorry you feel for someone who has accidentally slammed their hand in a door, picked up a scalding frying pan or been stung by a wasp. The other was how much empathy you have for other people\u2019s social pain \u2013 for someone who\u2019s been bullied at school, not invited to a party or dumped by their partner.\n\nThere was no difference in empathy for physical pain between the people who felt more or less lonely. But the people who said they often or very often felt lonely scored higher on average for empathy for social pain. Maybe because they have experienced for themselves what it feels like to be left out, they empathise more with other people who find themselves in the same situation.\n\nDISCOVER MORE:\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

'As a young black man in a chaotic environment, I always felt there was a chance that, whether or not I committed a crime, I could end up behind bars.' Determined to avoid this fate, Roger left his hometown of Easton, Pennsylvania as a teenager to pursue his dreams of being a film-maker. Overcoming the odds, he became the first black director to win an Academy Award. As his success grew, he thought about Easton less and less, until the day he heard about the suicide of his old friend Tommy Alvin.\n\nNow, after 30 years, Roger returns home to pay his respects and reconnect with close childhood friends. He is shocked and distressed to learn virtually all of the men in the Alvin family are, have been, or currently are, in prison. Haunted by how easily this could have happened to him, Roger embarks on a deeply personal journey into the heart of the American prison system to try and understand how this is possible. He starts in his own hometown but soon finds himself navigating a Byzantine maze of powerful institutions: police precincts, courtrooms, local jails, maximum security prisons and corporate empires. As he begins to explore a massive and dysfunctional system, he encounters complicit politicians and prison profiteers, each with their own self-serving motivations to maintain the status quo.\n\nRoger discovers prison administrators who recognise that most of their inmates should be free, yet are helpless to release them. He seeks counsel and knowledge from frustrated community leaders and activists, including the tireless Adam Foss. Foss's mission is to personally reeducate America's 31,000 prosecutors to 'cut off the supply' of people flowing into the system, and also try and save lives in his own neighbourhood, one young man at a time.\n\nRoger comes face to face with the endless hoard of Americans trapped behind the walls of the prison industrial complex and the families struggling to survive on the outside. He searches for solutions within the tangled web of political, social, and economic forces that drive the biased system, which has ensnared so many of his friends.\n\nThe film is a reckoning with America's conscience and a rebuke, not just of power and greed, but of silence - the stain of comfort, wilful ignorance of real costs. Roger's pursuit of an answer propels the film to examine all strata of the American society - from the free market ideals that America is founded upon to the savage ways in which the country has manifested those ideals. In Roger's view, there is no single villain and no obvious solution. Real change requires a new philosophy across a spectrum of industries. Not just the reining in of corporate influence but reform in political, financial, legal, educational and mental health care spheres as well. What can Roger offer? To return home and take a long hard look at the human toll. Will viewers look away as he once did? At what price?"

It really reduces the impacts of climate change in very important ways,\" said Prof Jim Skea, who co-chairs the IPCC.\n\n\"The second is the unprecedented nature of the changes that are required if we are to limit warming to 1.5C - changes to energy systems, changes to the way we manage land, changes to the way we move around with transportation.\"\n\nWhat's the one big takeaway?\n\n\"Scientists might want to write in capital letters, 'ACT NOW, IDIOTS,' but they need to say that with facts and numbers,\" said Kaisa Kosonen, of Greenpeace, who was an observer at the negotiations. \"And they have.\"\n\nThe researchers have used these facts and numbers to paint a picture of the world with a dangerous fever, caused by humans. We used to think if we could keep warming below two degrees this century, then the changes we would experience would be manageable.\n\nNot any more. This new study says that going past 1.5C is dicing with the planet's liveability. And the 1.5C temperature \"guard rail\" could be exceeded in just 12 years, in 2030.\n\nWe can stay below it - but it will require urgent, large-scale changes from governments and individuals and we will have to invest a massive pile of cash every year, about 2.5% of global gross domestic product (GDP), the value of all goods and services produced, for two decades.\n\nEven then, we will still need machines, trees and plants to capture carbon from the air that we can then store deep underground - forever.\n\nWhat can I do?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption No more beef? Five things you can do to help stop rising global temperatures\n\nThe report says there must be rapid and significant changes in four big global systems:\n\nenergy \u2022 land use \u2022 cities \u2022 industry\n\nBut it adds that the world cannot meet its target without changes by individuals, urging people to:\n\nbuy less meat, milk, cheese and butter and more locally sourced seasonal food - and throw less of it away \u2022 drive electric cars but walk or cycle short distances \u2022 take trains and buses instead of planes \u2022 use videoconferencing instead of business travel \u2022 use a washing line instead of a tumble dryer \u2022 insulate homes \u2022 demand low carbon in every consumer product\n\nLifestyle changes can make a big difference, said Dr Debra Roberts, the IPCC's other co-chair.\n\n\"That's a very empowering message for the individual,\" she said. \"This is not about remote science; it is about where we live and work, and it gives us a cue on how we might be able to contribute to that massive change, because everyone is going to have to be involved.\"\n\n\"You might say you don't have control over land use, but you do have control over what you eat and that determines land use.\n\n\"We can choose the way we move in cities and if we don't have access to public transport - make sure you are electing politicians who provide options around public transport.\"\n\nSorry, your browser cannot display this map\n\nFive steps to 1.5\n\nGlobal emissions of CO2 need to decline by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 Renewables are estimated to provide up to 85% of global electricity by 2050 Coal is expected to reduce to close to zero Up to seven million sq km of land will be needed for energy crops (a bit less than the size of Australia) Global net zero emissions by 2050\n\nHow much will all this cost?\n\nIt won't come cheap. The report says to limit warming to 1.5C, will involve \"annual average investment needs in the energy system of around $2.4 trillion\" between 2016 and 2035.\n\nExperts believe this number needs to be put in context.\n\n\"There are costs and benefits you have to weigh up,\" said Dr Stephen Cornelius, a former UK IPCC negotiator now with WWF. He says making big emissions cuts in the short term will cost money but be cheaper than paying for carbon dioxide removal later this century.\n\n\"The report also talks about the benefits as there is higher economic growth at 1.5 degrees than there is at 2C and you don't have the higher risk of catastrophic impacts at 1.5 that you do at two.\"\n\nHow years compare with the 20th Century average 2017 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Months J F M A M J J A S O N D Source: NOAA Replay\n\nWhat happens if we don't act?\n\nThe researchers say that if we fail to keep temperature rises below 1.5C, we are in for some significant and dangerous changes to our world.\n\nYou can kiss coral reefs goodbye, as the report says they would be essentially 100% wiped out at two degrees of warming.\n\nGlobal sea-level will rise about 10cm (4in) more if we let warming go to 2C. That may not sound like much but keeping to 1.5C means that 10 million fewer people would be exposed to the risks of flooding.\n\nThere are also significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat.\n\n\"We are already in the danger zone at one degree of warming,\" said Kaisa Kosonen, from Greenpeace. \"Both poles are melting at an accelerated rate; ancient trees that have been there for hundreds of years are suddenly dying; and the summer we've just experienced - basically, the whole world was on fire.\"\n\nIs this plan at all feasible?\n\nAnalysis by David Shukman, BBC science editor\n\nThe countdown to the worst of global warming seems to have accelerated. Seriously damaging impacts are no longer on a distant horizon later this century but within a timeframe that appears uncomfortably close.\n\nBy the same token, the report's \"pathways\" for keeping a lid on temperatures all mean that hard decisions cannot be delayed:\n\na shift away from fossil fuels by mid-century\n\ncoal phased out far sooner than previously suggested\n\nvast tracts of land given over to forests\n\nIt's mind-bending stuff and some will say it's hopelessly unrealistic, a climate scientists' fantasy. So is any of it plausible? On the one hand, the global economy relies on carbon and key activities depend on it. On the other, wind turbines and solar panels have tumbled in price and more and more countries and states such as California are setting ambitious green targets.\n\nUltimately, politicians will face a difficult choice: persuade their voters that the revolutionary change outlined in the report is urgently needed or ignore it and say the scientists have got it wrong.\n\nIs all this about saving small island states?\n\nThe idea of keeping the global temperature rise to 1.5 is something very close to the hearts and minds of small island and low-lying states, which fear being inundated with flooding if temperatures go to two degrees.\n\nBut over the three years that the report was in preparation, more and more scientific evidence has been published showing the benefits of staying close to 1.5C are not just for island nations in the Pacific.\n\n\"If you save a small island country, then you save the world,\" said Dr Amjad Abdulla, an IPCC author, from the Maldives. \"Because the report clearly states that no-one is going to be immune. It's about morality - it's about humanity.\"\n\nHow long have we got?\n\nNot long at all. But that issue is now in the hands of political leaders. The report says hard decisions can no longer be kicked down the road. If the nations of the world don't act soon, they will have to rely even more on unproven technologies to take carbon out of the air - an expensive and uncertain road.\n\n\"They really need to start work immediately. The report is clear that if governments just fulfil the pledges they made in the Paris agreement for 2030, it is not good enough. It will make it very difficult to consider global warming of 1.5C,\" said Prof Jim Skea.\n\n\"If they read the report and decide to increase their ambitions and act more immediately, then 1.5C stays within reach - that's the nature of the choice they face.\"\n\nCampaigners and environmentalists, who have welcomed the report, say there is simply no time left for debate.\n\n\"This is the moment where we need to decide\" said Kaisa Kosonen. \"We want to move to clean energy, sustainable lifestyles. We want to protect our forests and species. This is the moment that we will remember; this is the year when the turning point happened.\""

Insufficient data is available for Northern Ireland.\n\nFlat-sharing - the choice of many young employees - does not entirely resolve the issue as 12% of postcode areas in Britain remain \"unaffordable\" for two people in their 20s sharing a two-bedroom home.\n\nAnalysis by the BBC's data team shows that a gross annual income of \u00a324,800 would be needed for the average one-bedroom rental flat in England to become affordable under the 30% measure. In Scotland \u00a320,700 is needed and in Wales \u00a317,600.\n\nMany people can pay more than 30% of income on rent, but housing organisations say this puts considerable strain on the rest of their finances.\n\n'We have to live with our parents'\n\nImage caption Friends Molly Ebdon, 22, Danielle Campbell, 25, and Amelia Scott, 24 say renting is too expensive\n\nFriends Molly Ebdon, 22, Danielle Campbell, 25, and Amelia Scott, 24, all work in Cheltenham but find it prohibitively expensive to rent in the town.\n\n\"It is expensive on a starting salary and any kind of saving is not an option,\" Danielle said.\n\nAmelia, who previously rented but was now back living in the family home, said that moving into a rented home in Cheltenham would mean giving up a car and cutting back on other spending.\n\nBut staying with parents also brought restrictions on where to look for jobs.\n\nImage caption Morgan Twyning says she has chosen to live with her boyfriend's parents\n\nShop manager Morgan Twyning said she and her partner moved in with his parents in order to save, as rent would have taken up most of their salary.\n\nThe 25-year-old said that Sunday roasts were nice but the living arrangements were \"not what I had envisioned\".\n\n\"My friends definitely struggle. A lot of their money is used up in just their rent alone,\" she said.\n\nDan Wilson Craw, director of lobby group Generation Rent, said: \"This research is more evidence of how difficult it is to lead the life you expect. If you get a job and work hard, you should expect to have some choice about living arrangements.\n\n\"People in areas with a strong jobs market have to find somewhere to share with others in order to afford to live there.\"\n\nThe data reveals the importance of location in determining how big a chunk of their monthly salary is likely to be spent on rent.\n\nKate Faulkner, housing analyst and managing director of Propertychecklists.co.uk, said that renting can be affordable in many areas outside of London, but the particular squeeze in the capital dominated the debate and meant many other pressing concerns for these tenants were overlooked by policymakers.\n\nIn London, a 20-something with a typical average income would spend 55% of their monthly earnings on a mid-range one-bedroom flat. Housing charity Shelter considers any more than 50% as \"extremely unaffordable\".\n\nThat rises to 156%, so one-and-a-half times a typical salary, in one part of Westminster - the most expensive part of London - where an average one-bedroom home costs \u00a33,500 a month to rent.\n\nIn contrast, a tenant aged 22-29 looking for a typical property of this kind in the Scottish district of Argyll and Bute would only have to spend 15% of their income.\n\nLeast affordable areas outside London\n\nEpping Forest - postcode areas IG9 (rent \u00a31,230; 71% of income), RM4 (rent \u00a31,126; 65% of income), and IG7 (rent \u00a31,087; 62% of income)\n\nCambridge - postcode area CB2 (rent \u00a31,082; 62% of income)\n\nElmbridge - postcode area KT10 (rent \u00a31,151; 62% of income)\n\nFive most affordable postcode areas\n\nArgyll and Bute - postcode area PA28 (rent \u00a3266; 15% of income)\n\nScottish Borders - postcode areas TD9 (rent \u00a3327; 19%) and TD8 (rent \u00a3343; 20% of income)\n\nNorthumberland - postcode area NE62 (rent \u00a3324; 20% of income)\n\nEast Ayrshire - postcode area KA16 (rent \u00a3347; 20% of income)\n\nFinding one or more flatmates is a popular way of cutting the cost for many young tenants. The figures show that two people aged in their 20s sharing a two-bedroom flat in Manchester could pay just over 20% of their income on rent.\n\nSeparate research from Shelter suggests that tenants may already find that they are cramped for space compared with those who own their homes.\n\nThe charity estimated that private tenants in England are spending \u00a3140 more in housing costs than people with a mortgage. In the last 10 years, when families have been increasingly likely to rent, owners have seen the average floor space of their homes increase by 7% compared with a 2% rise for tenants.\n\nThat leaves owners with an average of 30 sq m extra floor space than tenants, which the charity suggests is the equivalent of a master bedroom and a kitchen.\n\nThis all comes at a time when young adults might look back in anger at previous generations. The BBC research shows that a private tenant in the UK typically spends more than 30% of their income on rent.\n\nIn 1980, UK private renters spent an average of 10% of their income on rent, or 14% in London. However, there were many more people renting from councils or in social housing at that time.\n\nLandlords say they face costs, including their mortgages, insurance, maintenance and licensing, that need to be covered from rents.\n\n\"These costs are increasing as the government introduces new measures to discourage investment in property, such as the removal of mortgage interest relief and the changes to stamp duty,\" said Chris Norris, director of policy at the National Landlords Association.\n\n\"This is compounded by the number of landlords divesting as their businesses become less financially viable, resulting in fewer properties available to rent, while demand for properties across the UK remains high.\"\n\nBBC News has set up a UK Facebook group all about affordable living. Join the Affordable Living group here.\n\nMap development by Joe Reed and Scott Jarvis, design by Debie Loizou and Irene de la Torre Arenas.\n\nMethodology: What counts as \"unaffordable\"?\n\nThere is no official UK measure of what constitutes an \"unaffordable\" rent, but based on recommendations from housing organisations the analysis uses a threshold of no more than 30% of income.\n\nThe National Housing Federation recommends 30% of gross median income as the measure generally used by people in the housing sector and academics. Shelter defines anything over 33% as \"unaffordable\" and additionally anything over 50% as \"extremely unaffordable\".\n\nWhy the focus on 20-somethings?\n\nBecause it's the age group that is by far most likely to be renting.\n\nRenting has more than doubled over the last 20 years, and 65% of 16-24 year olds and 42% of 25-34 year olds now rent privately, according to House of Commons Library research.\n\nWhere does the data come from?\n\nThe salary figures by age group come from the ONS's Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings survey and are regionally adjusted figures.\n\nRent figures show the median rent broken down by property size and postcode district for Great Britain, and were produced for the BBC by Hometrack, based on a snapshot value from March 2018. There was insufficient data on Northern Ireland.\n\nThe regional averages come from the Valuation Office Agency, StatsWales and the Scottish Government and cover 2017 for Scotland and Wales and April 2017-March 2018 for England.\n\nAreas in the interactive map showing postcode districts have been simplified."

We would uncap a bottle at the table and swig that tangy, delicious nectar of the gods straight.\n\nAre most of you repulsed? Probably. Were we way ahead of our time? Apparently.\n\nSome social media and online searches would have us believe that drinking vinegar is a cure-all. Our friends and colleagues will regale us with stories of the healing power of apple cider vinegar for whatever problem we may have just mentioned. \u201cOh, that backache from mowing? Vinegar.\u201d \u201cThat last 10 pounds? Vinegar will melt that right off.\u201d \u201cSyphilis, again? You know it \u2013 vinegar.\u201d\n\nAs a practicing physician and professor of medicine, people ask me about the benefits of drinking apple cider vinegar all the time. I enjoy those moments, because we can talk about the (extensive) history of vinegar, and then distil the conversations to how it could, maybe, benefit them.\n\nIf you like this, you might also like:\n\n\n\nHistorically, vinegar has been used for many ailments. A few examples are that of the famous Greek physician Hippocrates, who recommended vinegar for the treatment of cough and colds, and that of the Italian physician Tommaso Del Garbo, who, during an outbreak of plague in 1348, washed his hands, face and mouth with vinegar in the hopes of preventing infection.\n\nVinegar and water has been a refreshing drink from the time of Roman soldiers to modern athletes who drink it to slake their thirst. Ancient and modern cultures the world over have found good uses for \u2018sour wine\u2019.\n\nWhile there is plenty of historical and anecdotal testimony to the virtues of vinegar, what does medical research have to say on the subject of vinegar and health?\n\nThe most reliable evidence for the health benefits of vinegar come from a few human studies involving apple cider vinegar. One study demonstrated that apple cider vinegar can improve after-meal blood glucose levels in insulin-resistant subjects. In 11 people who were \u201cpre-diabetic,\u201d drinking 20 millilitres, a little more than one tablespoon, of apple cider vinegar lowered their blood sugar levels 30-60 minutes after eating more than a placebo did. That\u2019s good \u2013 but we must remember that it was only demonstrated in 11 pre-diabetic people.\n\nVinegar can potentially reduce blood pressure and abdominal fat cells\n\nAnother study on obese adults demonstrated a significant reduction in weight, fat mass and triglycerides. Researchers selected 155 obese Japanese adults to ingest either 15 millilitres, about one tablespoon, or 30 millilitres, a little more than two tablespoons, of vinegar daily, or a placebo drink, and followed their weight, fat mass and triglycerides. In both the 15 and 30 millilitre group, researchers saw a reduction in all three markers. While these studies need confirmation by larger studies, they are encouraging.\n\nStudies in animals, mostly rats, show that vinegar can potentially reduce blood pressure and abdominal fat cells. These results help build the case for follow-up studies in humans, but any benefit claims based only on animal studies is premature.\n\nIn all, the suspected health benefits of vinegar need to be confirmed by larger human studies, and this will certainly happen as researchers build on what has been studied in humans and animals to date.\n\nIs there any evidence that vinegar is bad for you? Not really. Unless you are drinking excessive amounts of it (duh), or drinking a high acetic acid concentration vinegar such as distilled white vinegar used for cleaning (consumable vinegar\u2019s acetic acid content is only 4 to 8%), or rubbing it in your eyes (ouch!), or heating it in a lead vat as the Romans did to make it sweet. Then, yeah, that\u2019s unhealthy.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t heat any kind of food in lead vats. That\u2019s always bad.\n\nSo have your fish and chips and vinegar. It\u2019s not hurting you. It may not be doing you all the good that you\u2019re hoping that it will; and it certainly is not a cure-all. But it is something that people all over the world will be enjoying with you. Now raise high that bottle of malt vinegar with me, and let\u2019s drink to our health.\n\n--\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Conversation, and is republished under a Creative Commons licence.

Hear what UK fans had to say about seeing their idols in concert\n\nThe group sold out two shows at the O2 Arena in London on 9 and 10 October.\n\nSo who are this global musical sensation? Read below to find out more.\n\nWho are BTS?\n\nBTS are a K-pop (or Korean pop) group made up of seven members - Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V and Jungkook - who come from all over South Korea.\n\nThey launched in 2013 and have since rocketed to global stardom.\n\nOver the years, the group have produced material around various themes starting with the 'School' trilogy.\n\nTo enjoy the CBBC Newsround website at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on. WATCH: Get to know the BTS boys\n\nThis was followed by the 'Most Beautiful Moment in Life', 'Wings', and most recently, the 'Love Yourself' series.\n\nTheir latest album 'Love Yourself: Answer' stormed to the top of the US charts, which saw South Korean President Moon Jae-in taking to Twitter to congratulate the boys on their success.\n\nBTS is the biggest K-pop group internationally - and it doesn't look like they're stopping any time soon.\n\nOops you can't see this activity! To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on.\n\nIf you cannot see the interactive activity on this page, click here.\n\nWhat is K-pop?\n\nK-pop was first born in South Korea in the 1990s as a mix between Western and Asian music.\n\nIt brings together elements of R&B, pop, hip-hop and rap - both in the music and in the way artists are styled.\n\nIt is known for its super slick production, edgy and totally amazing music videos.\n\nThe eye-catching fashion and super synchronised dance routines are very impressive too.\n\nBTS (\ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8) 'IDOL' Official MV K-pop is known for its unique styling, as well as it's creative and incredibly eye-catching music videos\n\nScooter Braun, who manages Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande, explains: \"These larger than life visuals allow fans who may not understand the language to still understand the music.\"\n\nIn order to become a successful genre, K-pop needed to go international.\n\nIt finally got its breakthrough in 2002, when a young female artist called BoA became number one not only in Korea, but also in Japan.\n\nThis helped K-pop to spread across Asia and, eventually, the rest of the world.\n\nTo enjoy the CBBC Newsround website at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on. WATCH: Ricky found out more about South Korean culture ahead of the 2018 Winter Olympics held in Pyeongchang (February 2018)\n\nNow, the K-pop industry is worth millions of pounds, with bands winning fans all over the world.\n\nThere is even a government department for K-pop in South Korea, which gives the musical genre official support because of how culturally and economically beneficial it is to the country.\n\nSince Gangnam Style by Psy broke the internet back in 2012, the genre saw its popularity grow even more. But no band or artist has come even close to the global popularity of BTS.\n\nWhy are BTS so successful?\n\nThere are four reasons that BTS have become as popular as they have.\n\n1. The music\n\nGetty Images The group launched in 2013 and have since become global superstars\n\nWith K-pop growing in popularity, they're simply making the music that people want to listen to!\n\nAccording to Billboard, their album 'Love Yourself: Tear', which is sung in Korean, became \"the first primarily foreign-language No 1 album in over 12 years.\"\n\nNot only that, but many people say that the subject of their music has played a part in their success.\n\nWhile many K-pop songs are about relationships and love, BTS cover subjects that other bands may not like bullying, elitism and mental health.\n\n2. Their performance\n\nBTS (\ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8) 'IDOL' Official MV BTS have racked up millions of views for their amazing performances\n\nThere's no point having amazing songs if you can't sell them to the world - and BTS have got this down to a fine art.\n\nWith their slick dance routines and extremely impressive music videos, they've attracted a loyal group of fans who have fallen in love with their music even more.\n\nMr Son, the band's choreographer, explains: \"Music videos seem to be one of the most important factors. Messages from an artist can be delivered more effectively.\"\n\nTo polish their performances, BTS practice for hours. For their debut performance, they were working at it for 12 to 15 hours a day to get it right. Well, it certainly paid off!\n\n3. The internet\n\nGetty Images BTS became the first K-pop group to win a US Billboard music award\n\nThe internet - and in particular social media - has played an enormous part in the success of the group.\n\nSuga told BBC Radio 1: \"I think we're so lucky to be born at the right time. Without social media, we wouldn't have been so successful.\"\n\nIn 2018, the boys won a Billboard Music Award for Top Social Artist, beating huge names like Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande and Selena Gomez.\n\nThey were the first K-Pop group to win one.\n\n\"We still cannot believe that we are standing here on this stage at the Billboard Music Awards,\" the group said in their acceptance speech.\n\nGetty Images Social media has helped the group to build up millions of loyal followers, like these fans - sporting some of the band's BT21 characters! - who are looking forward to seeing their idols in concert in Los Angeles last month\n\nSocial media has also allowed the group to connect with their followers on a really personal level and gather fans across the world, including here in the UK.\n\nNot only that, but they also engage with their fans via the internet in a different way to other groups like them.\n\nUnlike many other bands, pop culture expert Kim Hern-sik says BTS are actually managed by quite a small agency and are allowed to do what they want a bit more.\n\n\"The boys are granted freedom in interacting with their fans on social media,\" she says. \"They are really successful because they know how to interact with their fans and I think their popularity is here to stay.\"\n\n4. The fans\n\nGetty Images Fans get ready for a BTS concert in Los Angeles, USA. during the Love Yourself world tour\n\nNo band can have success without its fans and BTS has some of the most loyal, dedicated fans that the world has EVER seen with 16.5 million followers on Twitter and 13.5 million on Instagram.\n\nKnown as the ARMY, it was the fans who cast an unbelievable 300 million online votes to ensure that the group won their Billboard award.\n\nAnd in Autumn 2017, they watched the video for 'DNA' 50 million times on YouTube in just one month!\n\nWith numerous pages, profiles and sites set up all over the world by adoring followers, fans spend hours posting content, sending messages and sharing their love for the seven boys.\n\nThree facts about BTS 1. The boys all live together and apparently Jin does all the cooking. 2. The band's own choreographer Mr Son says that J-Hope is the best dancer. 3. What do they like to do to relax? The answer = SLEEP!\n\nWhat records have BTS broken?\n\nBTS have broken more records than we can even begin to count. But here are some of the biggies...\n\nFirst K-pop group to speak at the United Nations\n\nEPA RM (at the podium) speaks during an event at the United Nations headquarters in New York, USA\n\nIn September 2018, BTS made headlines for becoming the first Korean pop music group to address the United Nations (UN).\n\nRM, who's the leader of the band, spoke about overcoming insecurities and urged other young people to do the same.\n\n\"I've made many and plenty of mistakes in my life,\" he said.\n\n\"I have many faults and I have many more fears, but I'm going to embrace myself as hard as I can. And I'm starting to love myself gradually just little by little.\"\n\nFirst K-pop group to top the US album charts\n\nBTS; Big Hit Love Yourself: Tear made BTS the first K-pop band to top the US album charts\n\nTheir album 'Love Yourself: Tear' topped the US charts back in June, making them the first K-pop band to do so.\n\nThe latest instalment 'Love Yourself: Answer' did the same thing and they also received a record breaking 1.5 million pre-order sales for it.\n\nBut it isn't just the Love Yourself series that has brought the boys album success. Wings became the first Korean album to enter the UK album charts too.\n\nFirst Korean act to perform a US stadium show\n\nGetty Images Here, the boys were making history as the first Korean act to perform at the Billboard Awards\n\n...and they'll be bringing it to the UK oh-so-soon! We can hardly wait.\n\nOn the subject of performances, when the group performed the TV debut of their single Fake Love at the 2018 Billboard awards, they became the first Korean artist to perform at this ceremony and the first Asian artist to premiere a new song at it.\n\nAnd that's not everything. BTS are also the first Korean group to have performed at the American Music Awards, which they did back in November 2017 with their single DNA.\n\nOh so many online records (we've lost count!)\n\nGetty Images\n\nWell, first of all, BTS appear in the 2019 edition of Guinness World Records - twice.\n\nThe group has the record for the most Twitter engagements, with each of their tweets having an average of 330,624 retweets, replies, likes or other interactions.\n\nIn August 2018, the band's song 'Idol' also set the record for the most viewed music video online in its first 24 hours, with over 45 million views.\n\nThis beat Taylor Swift's record, which she set almost exactly one year before, when her track 'Look What You Made Me Do' got 43.2 million views.\n\nGetty Images The boys took the Twitter record off former One Direction member Harry Styles\n\nBy the start of October 2018, 'Idol' was sailing past 194 million views.\n\nOn top of these records, BTS also have the gong for longest time spent at the top of the US's Billboard Social 50 chart - a popularity chart which ranks the most active musical artists on the world's leading social networking services.\n\nThey pinched the record off Justin Bieber after remaining at number one for the 57th week in a row.\n\nWhat do you think of the record-breaking BTS boys? Have you been lucky enough to get tickets to see them in concert? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below."

    "text": "Before the beard trend, I preferred the look of a clean-shaven man. Then beards went mainstream. Now, after seeing countless men donning this look, I find myself giving five o\u2019clock shadows a second glance. Apparently, I\u2019m not alone.\n\n\u201cI find men with beards more attractive. Before it was not important, but now half of the men I know have beards,\u201d one survey respondent told The Guardian when asked about facial hair.\n\nIt\u2019s often thought that we are hardwired by millennia of natural selection to gravitate towards certain traits, like facial symmetry. We know our standards of beauty change over time \u2013 but those shifts have been thought to be relatively long-term, responding to the media and popular culture. And even if we know that our sense of beauty still differs somewhat from person to person, most of us believe that we each have a certain \u2018type\u2019 that stays somewhat constant throughout our lifetime.\n\nBut it turns out \u2018over time\u2019 is a shorter window than it once was. Our standards of beauty don\u2019t just change over months or years. They can change in an instant.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 The benefits of having a babyface\n\n\u2022 The myth of universal beauty\n\n\u2022 The surprising downsides of being drop dead gorgeous\n\nBeauty still is in the eye of the beholder, but our on-going work suggests that the beholder may be changing constantly \u2013 Haiyang Yang\n\n\u201cBeauty still is in the eye of the beholder, but our on-going work suggests that the beholder may be changing constantly,\u201d says Haiyang Yang, assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins University Carey Business School and author of a study that found that our sense of beauty can change based on other people\u2019s opinions. \u201cIt can be argued that the advent of the internet age may be causing people to change their beauty standards faster than ever before in human history.\u201d\n\nYou can blame how much we\u2019re bombarded today with images of other people \u2013 as well as, yes, internet dating.\n\nRecent research has found that our judgments of attractiveness not only change, but that we actually see the next face as more or less attractive, based on faces we have just seen. With a dating site or app, of course, this happens repeatedly and in mere milliseconds.\n\nIn one study at the University of Sydney, female participants rated 60 men as \u2018attractive\u2019 or \u2018not attractive\u2019 after pictures of their faces flashed on a screen for about one-third of a second. Researchers found that participants were more likely to rate a face as attractive if they thought the preceding face was attractive. (This went the other way, too: they were also more likely to rate a face as unattractive if they thought the preceding face was unattractive.) When participants viewed 242 female faces and were asked to rate their attractiveness on a scale of one to eight, they viewed people as more or less beautiful based on their previous responses \u2013 so much so that their perception of beauty changed with each new face.\n\nThe reason comes down to how the brain handles new information. \u201cYour brain can\u2019t process all the information that\u2019s continuously flooding into your visual system from your eyes, so it creates shortcuts where it can,\u201d says Jessica Taubert, lead author of the study at the University of Sydney, where she is a postdoctoral researcher. \u201cYour brain relies on previous visual cues so it doesn\u2019t have to constantly reanalyse that information.\u201d\n\nIn this case, the shortcut used is what scientists refer to as \u2018serial dependence\u2019: we expect the physical state of an object to remain stable from one moment to the next. For example, when you glance at a coffee mug and look away, you expect its identity to be the same when you look at it again.\n\nA similar concept applies in online dating. As millions of lovebirds scour digital profiles, their brains assume while they are fixated on a face that its identity will remain the same \u2013 attractive or not attractive. They quickly swipe to the next profile and are presented with what could be best described as an illusion. Their brains haven\u2019t had time to reanalyse the information as a new face belonging to a new person, so they perceive the next face as they perceived the last.\n\n\u201cThe fact that our brains quickly adapt to our visual environment is not new. What is new is the speed at which our environment can change,\u201d says Teresa Pegors, a former assistant professor of psychology at Azusa Pacific University and co-author of the study.\n\n\u201cThis can make beauty a constantly shifting target and is one piece, though certainly not the only or even most important piece, in the equation of why it is harder to be content with a single partner over the long haul.\u201d\n\nGlimpse effect\n\nIf you find yourself \u2018liking\u2019 more people online than you do in the real world, there may be another reason, too. It has to do with the speed with which you click through your options.\n\nWhen we catch a glimpse of someone we are more likely to find them attractive than if we look at them for a longer period of time\n\nResearchers have found that when we catch a glimpse of someone, we are more likely to find them attractive than if we look at them for a longer period of time. This phenomenon happens because whenever we see something, we aren\u2019t just \u2018seeing\u2019 it \u2013 we\u2019re attaching a judgment about its value.\n\nIn the case of beauty, the people we find attractive are seen as higher-value because they could be a potential match or mate. And so, given the scant information that comes from a quick glance, our brains are biased towards perceiving the option of greater importance: higher attractiveness.\n\n\u201cIf you accidentally think that someone is more attractive than they really are, all you need is a second glance to correct your mistake,\u201d says David Eagleman, a Stanford University neuroscientist and the study\u2019s co-author. \u201cBut if you accidentally undervalue their attractiveness, that might result in missing a potential mate.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018glimpse effect\u2019 may be happening when users swipe too quickly on dating apps.\n\nThe brain doesn\u2019t have time to fully digest all the information in such a short time, so it brings its assumptions to the table. \u201cDating apps have the same pressure as evolution: it\u2019s better to quickly swipe right, see if there\u2019s a match, and then reconfirm your attraction, rather than swipe left and make a mistake. We\u2019ve all heard stories of the perfect partner someone accidentally swiped left too fast on,\u201d says Eagleman.\n\nWe already knew that our perceptions of the world are strongly affected by our context, our mood, and the actions of others. This has always been true.\n\nBut when it comes to viewing new mates, in particular, we\u2019re now dealing with much more information, provided at a much faster clip, than ever before \u2013 which makes it likely that our own perceptions fluctuate more quickly.\n\nPegors sees a potential upside: all of this shows that we can change our brains by exposing ourselves to different information.\n\n\u201cOur visual perception of beauty changes with every face we see. This means we can make our standard of beauty more realistic by simply changing our visual experiences,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are not \u2018stuck\u2019 with an impossible standard that the digital era is feeding us. We can choose to look at less of these images.\u201d\n\nAll it would require is logging out of our favourite dating app\u2026 which may, of course, be easier said than done.\n\nJoin 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.

    "title": "Troubles: The Life After",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Poetic, intimate account of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, told through the stories of a handful of people who lost loved ones during the conflict. The Life After marks not only the 50th anniversary of the start of the Troubles but is a timely reminder of what could be at stake when the still fragile peace comes under new pressures, in the event of a hard border following Brexit.\n\nFrom 1969 to 2001, 3,532 people were killed and 47,541 injured as a result of the Troubles. Many of these were civilians caught in the crossfire as conflict and murder became part of the daily narrative. A steady succession of British and Irish politicians made promises, looked for solutions, formed unlikely alliances and wondered privately what could possibly be done to bring peace to Northern Ireland. Politicians and diplomats around the world strove for a solution, and even American presidents felt compelled to get involved. Amidst the headlines and the rhetoric ordinary people were being killed, maimed and terrorised. This film, directed by multiple Bafta winner Brian Hill and first-time director Niamh Kennedy, tells some of their stories.\n\nStories like that of Virtue Dixon, whose daughter Ruth was killed on her 24th birthday when she was celebrating at the Droppin' Well Inn in 1982. An INLA bomb brought the roof down, killing both civilians and British soldiers. Virtue tells the story of the aftermath, of how life changed forever after the murder of Ruth. She does so partly in interview but also in specially written verses from Northern Irish poet Nick Laird. Each person in the film has their own poem, which crystallises and amplifies elements of their story.\n\nMoving from the particular and the individual to the general, Laird has written a poetic narration, spoken by Northern Irish actress Bronagh Gallagher, in which issues such as collusion are discussed. Archive footage is also employed to reveal more about the conflict and the times. Within the narratives are important questions, many of which feel more relevant than ever today - for example, does terrorism ever advance a political cause?"

In 1965 she made a triumphant debut in the United States, taking over the title role - at short notice - of Donizetti's Lucrezia Borgia at Carnegie Hall.\n\nHer performance brought widespread praise for the beauty of her voice and her dramatic interpretation, and established her as an international star.\n\nImage copyright AFP / Getty Images Image caption Caball\u00e9 performing in Vienna in 1979\n\nThe same year she appeared at Glyndebourne in Der Rosenkavalier and The Marriage of Figaro, but she waited another seven years for her Covent Garden debut - as Violetta in La Traviata.\n\nA short but imposing figure, Caball\u00e9 endeared herself to audiences around the world with her irrepressible personality. Her fans called her La Superba - the superb one.\n\nHer career was dogged by ill health. In 1985 she spent three months in hospital with a brain tumour, and had treatment for heart trouble in 1993.\n\nIn 2015, she was given a six-month suspended prison sentence for tax fraud.\n\nSpanish media say plans are being made for a funeral in Barcelona on Monday."

At the centre of this great sea, and surrounded by crystal clear waters, is Simon's first stop, the beautiful island of Malta. Driven by a surge of tourists, modern-day Malta is booming. But beneath the picture-postcard image lies a country accused of being a haven for money laundering and organised crime, where journalists can be murdered by car bombs.\n\nWhen Simon takes a ferry to his next destination, Calabria in southern Italy, he discovers a region in the grip of Europe's most powerful mafia, the 'Ndrangheta. With rare access to police and customs investigators, Simon follows an armed convoy carrying a ton of seized cocaine, joins a stakeout of a high-level suspect, and crawls through a huge underground warren of tunnels and bunkers built by fugitive mafia bosses. Travelling east along the southern tip of mainland Italy, Simon visits a turtle conservation centre, meeting Raoul, a loggerhead turtle rescued after swallowing huge quantities of plastic, a massive and increasing threat to Mediterranean wildlife. Simon helps release him back into the sea. Taking the overnight ferry from the heel of Italy, Simon arrives in one of the least-known but most beautiful corners of the Mediterranean, Albania. Under communist rule, Albania was isolated and shut off from most of the world. In a country now hoping for EU membership, Simon discovers an ancient culture of vendetta, where if an adult commits a crime, a child can be killed in revenge. Simon ends the first leg of his journey at a spectacular wildlife reserve where bird life is now recovering following the country's groundbreaking ban on hunting."

Loneliness seems to be a common feature of the graduation blues.\n\nKayleigh Rattle, 31, who graduated from Warwick University in 2008, says: \"I'll never forget the indescribable loneliness I felt upon leaving university.\n\n\"And, actually, I try not to think about the experience too much today because it still triggers a wistfulness so palpable for a time that's now passed, and happened a decade ago.\"\n\nNew identity\n\nIt can be as if many students aren't ready to say goodbye to their close companions when they all go home.\n\nUniversity prepares young people for the transition from adolescence into adulthood - but does it prepare them for the realities of working life?\n\nAlthough the graduate employment rate stands at 82% , according to the Office of National Statistics in 2017, it can take some time to secure a fulltime job.\n\nSo after three years of relative freedom, hordes of students will probably find themselves packing their bags and trundling back home to their parents' house.\n\nKayleigh says: \"I really struggled with that - having a curfew again, not being able to sleep in the same bedroom as my boyfriend, and, I felt, being treated like a child again.\"\n\nImage copyright Other Image caption Kayleigh Rattle describes university as a combination of indispensable relationships and learning\n\nThis feeling of stepping backwards can be an extra incentive to find a \"proper job\".\n\nCarolyn Mumby, counsellor coach with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, says: \"The return home can feel like trying to squash yourself back into the shape of your previous self.\n\n\"It can be challenging to maintain your autonomy.\n\n\"You may also be challenging the autonomy of your parents and carers who have adjusted to life without you living at home.\n\n\"There is a renegotiation then of roles and relationships.\"\n\nSophie Phillipson, 27, felt \"ovewhelmed\" and \"nervous\" at the prospect of facing adult life.\n\nShe went on to found the website HelloGrads, which offers skills to help ease the transition from education to working life.\n\nShe says: \"You come out with a good degree and then reality hits. And it's quite difficult because you think you're going to get a good job. And if you don't, you can become quite overwhelmed.\"\n\nEmily Williams, 24, and a Sheffield Hallam graduate, took a job that was really disappointing.\n\nShe says she used to walk to work every day and think: \"How can I get slightly injured, not enough to be seriously hurt or die, but just enough so I don't have to go to work?\"\n\nShe suggests people take time to find out what they want to do.\n\n\"There is absolutely no shame in going back home and getting a job at your local supermarket whilst you figure out what your passions are,\" she says. \"Don't feel like you should already know what you want to do.\"\n\nImage copyright other Image caption Sophie Phillipson, and her mother, Julie, set up website HelloGrads to help other young people transition from university into adult working life\n\nSophie says: \"There's a lot more to consider than you first think - and nobody tells you.\n\n\"Money is constantly on your mind and there is a huge pressure to succeed from your parents, even though they have the best intentions.\"\n\n'Blagging it'\n\nStudent fees tripled in 2012 and Sophie believes this also has a part to play in the pressure students place on themselves to succeed and make their degree \"worth it\".\n\nAnd social media doesn't help. \"No-one posts the countless rejections they faced to get to their position,\" Sophie says.\n\nBut it isn't all doom and gloom. Graduates are still more likely to be employed than people with fewer qualifications.\n\nClaire says that although leaving university was tough, 12 years on she is settled, has a family of her own and a successful business.\n\nShe believes young people shouldn't expect working life to be like university. But they should \"embrace these new challenges, because your next adventures are only just beginning\".\n\nEmily seconds this and says: \"No-one has a clue what they're doing. People in their 30s tell me they don't feel like proper adults yet.\n\n\"Everyone is going with the flow - and blagging it as they go.\""

They already understood.\n\nAnd it seems Betty's experience, though shocking perhaps, is not uncommon.\n\nRecent research, funded by Disability Research on Independent Living and Learning (Drill), found adult social services too often ignored the needs of disabled people who became parents.\n\nThe research, by the Tilda Goldberg centre for social work and social care, found children's social services too often saw the parent's impairment as a potential risk to their children.\n\nAnd they often prioritised \"monitoring\" over meaningful support that would keep families together and avoid interventions in a crisis.\n\nTo be on the end of this mismatch could be terrifying for parents, the research found.\n\nBetty was no exception.\n\nShe says: \"The fear you carry with you, which other [non-disabled] parents don't experience, cannot be understated.\n\n\"If you are non-disabled, for the vast majority of people, the thought of social services involvement does not even feature.\n\n\"But every disabled person I spoke to, when I was pregnant, had a concern.\n\n\"There is always some implication because you have an impairment, that you may not be a fantastically good parent.\"\n\n'Competent mother?'\n\nHowever, due to her mobility problems, it was inevitable that at some point she would need some extra help.\n\n\"For the first 10 to 12 months while Sally wasn't mobile, my existing day-care package and support was enough,\" Betty says.\n\n\"Once she moved on from milk and was mobile, it wasn't.\"\n\nOne of the things Betty needed help with was making her baby's food.\n\n\"It seems like such a little thing to make your child something to eat,\" she says.\n\n\"But if you can't stand for long, and your hands don't work very well, it can be one of the most distressing things.\n\n\"It was as if because I couldn't provide that, I wasn't competent as a mother.\"\n\nEventually, she and her husband, Don, reached the agonising point where they had to do the very thing they had been fearing - contact social services.\n\n\"You are in this position that you have explored all the other options and you have no other choice but to ask for help,\" Betty says.\n\n\"But if you do so, if you call social services, it means you're opening yourself up to the potential that social services will look at everything and that your child might be taken away.\n\n\"I didn't want to tell social services any earlier because I thought if they saw a thriving baby, they wouldn't be able to do anything to me.\n\n\"But my baby didn't thrive, at the beginning.\n\n\"My biggest worry was moving her about - I couldn't carry her and I couldn't bathe her.\"\n\nSo Betty prepared a back-up plan to hand her child to relatives, if social services did seek to intervene.\n\nWhen they eventually made the call, to adult social services, they told her exactly what she feared - that the manager wanted to refer the matter to children's services, who are responsible for child protection.\n\n\"When that contact came back, I remember ringing my health visitor and just sobbing hysterically. It was devastating.\"\n\n\"I don't think that any parent sees being transferred to children's services as a positive thing.\"\n\n'Happy and loved'\n\nFortunately, Betty says, the social worker she was allocated agreed Betty's need was because of her disability, not her competency as a mother, and therefore promised to stand firm against her manager's intention to shift the case towards children' services.\n\nWith budgets being tight, the social worker thought her manager may have been keen to transfer some of the costs of Betty's care to another department.\n\nBut, Betty says, she knew the law and was prepared to fight to keep the family together.\n\n\"As far as she was concerned [my] baby was thriving and I was a good mother,\" Betty says.\n\nAnd the social worker successfully argued that her needs as a mother should be met by adult social services.\n\nSue Bott, from Drill, says: \"We know that resources are tight and health and social care professionals face complex demands.\n\n\"But this isn't complicated. If they work with disabled parents, they can help support families to stay together, which is the best outcome for everyone.\"\n\nAnd this was the outcome in the case of Betty, Don and Sally - who is now two.\n\n\"She's the greatest joy of my life - she's wonderful, happy and loved,\" Betty says.\n\n\"And having social care support in her life means she is loved by lots of adults.\n\n\"The care staff are like our extended family.\"\n\nBut Betty adds sadly that as Sally grows, her needs will change and \"the threat won't fully go away until she is substantially older\"."

We must work together with determination - to prove that genocidal campaigns will not only fail, but lead to accountability for the perpetrators and justice for the survivors.\"\n\nNew Iraqi President Barham Saleh called the award \"an honour for all Iraqis who fought terrorism and bigotry\".\n\nDr Mukwege was operating at his hospital when he heard he had won the prize.\n\n\"I was in the operating room so when they started to make noise around [it] I wasn't really thinking about what was going on, and suddenly some people came in and told me the news,\" he told Norwegian newspaper VG.\n\nHe dedicated his award to all women affected by sexual violence.\n\n\"This Nobel prize is a recognition of the suffering and the failure to adequately compensate women who are victims of rape and sexual violence in all countries around the world,\" he told reporters gathered outside his clinic.\n\nWho is Nadia Murad?\n\nMs Murad did not just lose her mother in the genocide. She endured three months as a sex slave at the hands of IS militants. She was bought and sold several times and subjected to sexual and physical abuse during her captivity.\n\nAfter escaping, she became an activist for the Yazidi people, campaigning to help put an end to human trafficking and calling on the world to take a tougher line on rape as a weapon of war.\n\nMs Murad described her escape in a BBC interview in 2016, detailing how the women who were held captive were treated by IS.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Nadia Murad tells the BBC's Hardtalk how she escaped IS\n\nShe was awarded the Vaclav Havel Human Rights Prize by the Council of Europe in 2016 and called for an international court to judge crimes committed by IS in her acceptance speech in Strasbourg.\n\nMs Murad, the first Iraqi to win the award, was named the UN's first goodwill ambassador for survivors of human trafficking later that year.\n\nWho is Denis Mukwege?\n\nHe has spent decades helping rape victims in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nHe and his colleagues are said to have treated about 30,000 rape victims, developing great expertise in the treatment of serious injuries sustained during sex assaults that were carried out as a weapon of war.\n\nThe 63-year-old has won a number of international prizes, including the 2008 UN Human Rights Prize, and was named African of the Year in 2009.\n\nHe lives under the permanent protection of UN peacekeepers at his hospital and has also previously called for a tougher line on rape as a weapon of war.\n\nDenis Mukwege in his own words\n\nIt was in 1999 that our first rape victim was brought into the hospital. After being raped, bullets had been fired into her genitals and thighs.\n\nI thought that was a barbaric act of war but the real shock came three months later. Forty-five women came to us with the same story, they were all saying: \"People came into my village and raped me, tortured me.\"\n\nOther women came to us with burns. They said that after they had been raped, chemicals had been poured on their genitals.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Dr Mukwege travelled to northern Iraq in June to visit the Yazidi minority's holiest sites\n\nI started to ask myself what was going on. These weren't just violent acts of war, but part of a strategy. You had situations where multiple people were raped at the same time, publicly - a whole village might be raped during the night. In doing this, they hurt not just the victims but the whole community, which they force to watch.\n\nThe result of this strategy is that people are forced to flee their villages, abandon their fields, their resources, everything. It's very effective.\n\nWho else won a Nobel award this year?\n\nEarlier this week the Nobel prize for physics was awarded to Donna Strickland, only the third woman winner of the award and the first in 55 years. The Canadian was honoured along with Arthur Ashkin, from the US, and Gerard Mourou, from France.\n\nThe Nobel prize for medicine was awarded to two scientists - Professor James P Allison from the US and Professor Tasuku Honjo from Japan - who discovered how to fight cancer using the body's immune system.\n\nFor chemistry, the prize was awarded to three scientists for their discoveries in enzyme research. Americans Frances Arnold and George P Smith shared the prize with Briton Gregory Winter\n\nHow is the prize decided?\n\nEligible nominators from around the world can put forward candidates up to 1 February of the award year, while Nobel Committee members have more time\n\nAll nominations are reviewed by the committee - whose five members are chosen by the Norwegian parliament - before a shortlist of 20-30 candidates is selected\n\nA group of Norwegian and international advisers writes individual reports on the shortlisted candidates. Using these and further reports, the committee narrows the selection down to a handful\n\nA decision is reached in the last meeting of the committee, usually in late September or early October, before the prize is announced\n\nIf a unanimous decision cannot be reached, a simple majority vote is used\n\nAfter the announcement, the award ceremony takes place on 10 December, the date of Alfred Nobel's death\n\nPrevious winners include figures such as Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr, Mother Theresa and the Dalai Lama\n\nLast year the prize was won by the anti-nuclear weapons group International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, a coalition of NGOs whose work has highlighted the humanitarian risk of such weapons"

It is therefore important to assess the true burden, causes, and reasons for selfie deaths so that appropriate interventions can be made.\"\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Could the power of fake pills be used to treat some of our most common medical complaints? To find out, Dr Michael Mosley embarks on Britain's largest ever trial to investigate the placebo effect. He is heading to Blackpool to gather 117 people suffering from backache - one of the leading types of chronic pain - before trying to treat them with nothing but fake pills and the power of the mind.\n\nWorking with experts from the University of Oxford, Michael discovers that the placebo effect is more than just a medical curiosity. The brain is actually capable of producing its own drugs, and these can be more powerful than prescription painkillers. Michael's volunteers come from all walks of life, but they have all suffered with bad backs for years and feel their conventional medication isn't up to the job. They include Stacey, who is struggling to keep up with her two energetic daughters, wheelchair user Jim, who longs to be able to get back on a boat, and poker player Moyra, who is looking for a painkiller which doesn't affect her performance.\n\nThey think they are taking part in the trial of a powerful new painkiller, but their blue and white capsules actually contain nothing but ground-up rice. Can this fake treatment make a real difference? And how will the volunteers react when Michael reveals the truth? Michael also finds out about some remarkable placebo experiments from around the world, including a woman in Oxfordshire who experienced a near-miraculous recovery after undergoing fake surgery to fix her chronic shoulder pain. Plus a team in Lancashire who want to see if the placebo effect can cure a broken heart. And Michael discovers a team in Germany working on a placebo that works even if you know you are taking it, which might improve the lives of transplant patients. Michael also tests this out on himself - attempting to train his own body to respond to a fake treatment - a foul-tasting green drink - as if he were taking actual drugs."

    "text": "Image copyright Climate Vulnerable Forum\n\nOver the past three years, climate scientists have shifted the definition of what they believe is the \"safe\" limit of climate change.\n\nFor decades, researchers argued the global temperature rise must be kept below 2C by the end of this century to avoid the worst impacts.\n\nBut scientists now argue that keeping below 1.5C is a far safer limit for the world.\n\nEveryone agrees that remaining below that target will not be easy.\n\nThis week in South Korea, researchers will report on the feasibility and costs of achieving this lower limit.\n\nThe scientists of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are gathering in the city of Incheon to hammer out a plan in co-operation with government delegates, on the actions that would need to be taken to meet this new goal.\n\nSo why has the goal changed?\n\nIn a word - politics.\n\nThe idea of two degrees as the safe threshold for warming evolved over a number of years from the first recorded mention by economist William Nordhaus in 1975.\n\nImage caption It was during the Paris climate negotiations that the 1.5C target became a reality\n\nBy the mid 1990s, European ministers were signing up to the two-degree limit, and by 2010 it was official UN policy. Governments agreed in Cancun to \"hold the increase in global average temperatures below two degrees\".\n\nHowever, small island states and low-lying countries were very unhappy with this perspective, because they believed it meant their territories would be inundated with sea water as higher temperatures caused more ice to melt and the seas to expand.\n\nThey commissioned research which showed that preventing temperatures from rising beyond 1.5C would give them a fighting chance.\n\nAt the ill-fated Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, the climate-vulnerable nations pushed for the lower figure, but their efforts were lost in the blame-game that followed the collapse of the conference.\n\nBut the idea didn't go away completely - and by the time of the Paris negotiations in 2015, it emerged centre-stage as French diplomats sought to build a broad coalition of rich and poor nations who would support a deal.\n\nIt worked.\n\nWhat difference does half a degree actually make?\n\nMore than you might think!\n\nLeaked drafts of the IPCC Summary for Policymakers that will be published after a week of haggling with government delegates in South Korea point to some major differences in terms of the impacts on the world of 1.5 and 2C. We've summarised the main ones here:\n\n\"Two degrees is no longer the two degrees we thought it was,\" said Kaisa Kosonen from Greenpeace who is monitoring the progress of the IPCC 1.5C report.\n\n\"It's increasingly becoming meaningless as a climate goal, when you look at the risks that would come with it and what we are already witnessing with one degree - why would you have a goal that doesn't protect anything that we care about?\"\n\nHow hard will it be to keep below the limit?\n\nVery - the world has already warmed by around one degree and according to leaked drafts of the 1.5 report, we will sail past that limit by around 2040.\n\nThe new IPCC report won't tell governments what to do but will instead set out a range of approaches that will likely involve heavy cuts in carbon emissions, a rapid transition to renewable energy and lifestyle and dietary changes as well.\n\nWhat happens if we go beyond 1.5?\n\nThe IPCC have spent a lot of time considering that question and have devised a cunning plan!\n\nIn their draft reports they talk about \"overshoot\", meaning that in many scenarios they expect temperatures to go beyond 1.5 but they believe they can be clawed back below the limit by using a range of technologies that will remove carbon dioxide from the air - these range from planting trees to more complex, untested machines.\n\nSome experts, though, believe that there are considerable risks to this approach.\n\nImage copyright UNFCCC Image caption Climate campaigners have been pushing hard for 1.5C for several years\n\n\"A species that goes extinct at two degrees will still be extinct if you come back down to 1.5C,\" said Dr Stephen Cornelius from WWF, a former UK government IPCC negotiator.\n\n\"Some things may come back but some things are irreversible, in terms of taking a risk you'd want to try and keep below 1.5, and clearly that means faster, deeper earlier emissions cuts, and it probably means carbon dioxide removal. But these technologies - some of them we know what to do, but some are early days and need to be assessed.\"\n\nAre there any hopeful signs?\n\nSurprisingly, yes!\n\nWhile the task of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C this century is massive, there are some indicators on the horizon that show that some governments are recognising the seriousness of the issue and are taking steps to deal with it.\n\nThe UK government says \"it intends to legislate for a net zero emissions target at an appropriate point in the future,\" and has joined 18 other nations in the Carbon Neutrality Coalition.\n\nSome environmentalists believe that the pathway to keeping temperatures down to 1.5 can be done without resorting to mechanical devices or planting billions of trees.\n\n\"If we have very rapid emissions reductions and couple that with massive scaling up of restoration of land and changes in our food system to reduce meat consumption, we can get to 1.5C in a way that creates lots of wellbeing for people,\" said Hannah Mowat from Fern.\n\n\"It creates better air and reduces levels of obesity. It's a world we want to say yes to, rather than a further industrialisation of our landscapes.\""

Such trials would take considerable effort but seem worthwhile to conduct.\"\n\nStephen Buckley, from mental-health charity Mind, said it was good advice to eat a healthy diet, get regular physical activity and cut down on \"mood-altering products, such as sugar, caffeine and alcohol\".\n\n\"It's widely accepted that there's a strong connection between what we eat and how we feel, with blood-sugar levels affecting our mood and energy.\n\n\"If you are experiencing depression or anxiety, it might be hard to focus on your health, or you may resort to unhelpful coping strategies, such as drugs or alcohol.\n\n\"If this is the case, you might benefit from other forms of treatment such as medication or talking therapies.\"\n\nResearch into the traditional Mediterranean diet has shown it may reduce our risk of developing conditions like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and raised cholesterol, which are all risk factors for heart disease. Researchers have also found that people who closely follow a Mediterranean diet may live a longer life and be less likely to put on weight.\n\nA typical Mediterranean diet includes lots of vegetables, fruits, beans, cereals and cereal products, for example wholegrain bread, pasta and brown rice. It also contains moderate amounts of fish, white meat and some dairy produce.\n\nIt is the combination of all these elements that seems to bring health benefits, but one of the key aspects is the inclusion of healthy fats.\n\nIf you're worried about your mental health, speak to your family doctor."

    "title": "The Bank That Almost Broke Britain",
    "authors": [],
    "text": "Ten years on from the global financial crash, this documentary tells the extraordinary story of how a small Scottish bank briefly grew to become the biggest in the world before collapsing and triggering the largest financial bail-out in British history. It focuses on a single day, 7 October 2008, when the Royal Bank of Scotland collapsed and almost took the entire UK banking system down with it. This dramatic financial thriller, set over 24 hours, is intercut with the story of the amazing rise and shocking fall of RBS.\n\nThe film reveals how much of RBS's growth lay in the lucrative American subprime market and acquisitions of banks like Greenwich Capital, which were using CDOs to generate huge profits. And as RBS's profits grew spectacularly, so did its lavish spending. Goodwin flew in private RBS jets and commissioned a new \u00a3350m HQ on the outskirts of Edinburgh. Never-before-seen footage reveals the spectacular opening party at Gogarburn, attended by the Queen and the cream of Scottish society. But less than three years later, thanks largely to the collapse of the subprime mortgage market in the US, Goodwin's bank was on its knees, and those charged with protecting the British economy were faced with a stark choice - save RBS or risk the country's banking system being taken down by its collapse. Alistair Darling and the team reveal what it was like to have just 24 hours to come up with a plan and strike a deal with all of Britain's major banks, with the nation's economy at stake. In all, the bailout was to cost the taxpayer well over a trillion pounds and would effectively take RBS into public ownership. Fred Goodwin was forced to leave the bank that he had run for eight extraordinary years, but public anger centred on the fact that he hung on to most of his huge RBS pension and that no further action was taken against him, his team or the board of RBS. However, in 2012 he was stripped of his knighthood.\n\nTen years on since that dramatic collapse and bailout, the film finally explores the widespread sense of injustice that 'over many years the gains were privatised to the bankers', but in the last decade all the pain had been 'nationalised' to the ordinary people of the UK, and asks how much of the political turmoil we now find ourselves in can be traced directly back to the bailout of the bank that almost broke Britain."

For cancers such as advanced melanoma, lung, and kidney, these immune-boosting drugs have transformed the outlook for many patients who had run out of options.\n\n\"The booming field of immunotherapy that these discoveries have precipitated is still relatively in its infancy, so it's exciting to consider how this research will progress in the future and what new opportunities will arise.\"\n\nMedicine is the first of the Nobel Prizes awarded each year.\n\nThe literature prize will not be handed out this year, after the awarding body was affected by a sexual misconduct scandal.\n\nPrevious winners\n\n2017- Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young for unravelling how bodies keep a circadian rhythm or body clock\n\n2016 - Yoshinori Ohsumi for discovering how cells remain healthy by recycling waste.\n\n2015 - William C Campbell, Satoshi \u014cmura and Youyou Tu for anti-parasite drug discoveries.\n\n2014 - John O'Keefe, May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser for discovering the brain's navigating system.\n\n2013 - James Rothman, Randy Schekman, and Thomas Sudhof for their discovery of how cells precisely transport material.\n\n2012 - Two pioneers of stem cell research - John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka - were awarded the Nobel after changing adult cells into stem cells.\n\n2011 - Bruce Beutler, Jules Hoffmann and Ralph Steinman shared the prize after revolutionising the understanding of how the body fights infection.\n\n2010 - Robert Edwards for devising the fertility treatment IVF which led to the first \"test tube baby\" in July 1978.\n\n2009 - Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider and Jack Szostak for finding the telomeres at the ends of chromosomes."

    "text": "Image copyright Uni Waterloo Image caption Dr Strickland shared the prize for discoveries in laser physics\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to a woman for the first time in 55 years.\n\nDonna Strickland, from Canada, is only the third woman winner of the award, along with Marie Curie, who won in 1903, and Maria Goeppert-Mayer, who was awarded the prize in 1963.\n\nDr Strickland shares this year's prize with Arthur Ashkin, from the US, and Gerard Mourou, from France.\n\nIt recognises their discoveries in the field of laser physics.\n\nDr Ashkin developed a laser technique described as optical tweezers, which is used to study biological systems.\n\nDrs Mourou and Strickland paved the way for the shortest and most intense laser pulses ever created. They developed a technique called Chirped Pulse Amplification (CPA). It has found uses in laser therapy targeting cancer and in the millions of corrective laser eye surgeries which are performed each year.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Dr Strickland said it was \"surprising\" it had been such a long time since a woman had won the award.\n\nHowever, she stressed that she had \"always been treated as an equal\", and that \"two men also won it with me, and they deserve this prize as much if not more than me\".\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Arthur Ashkin and Gerard Mourou were honoured for their contributions to the field\n\nThe award comes a few days after a physicist gave a \"highly offensive\" lecture at the Cern particle physics laboratory in Geneva in which he said that physics had been \"built by men\" and that male scientists were being discriminated against.\n\nHe has since been suspended by the research centre.\n\nDr Strickland called the physicist's remarks \"silly\" and said she never took such comments \"personally\".\n\nThe last woman to win the physics prize, German-born American physicist Maria Goeppert-Mayer, took the award for her discoveries about the nuclei of atoms.\n\nPolish-born physicist Marie Curie shared the 1903 award with her husband Pierre Curie and Antoine Henri Becquerel for their research into radioactivity.\n\nThe award is worth a total of nine million Swedish kronor (\u00a3770,686; $998,618).\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre Curie\n\nReacting to her win, Dr Strickland, who is based at the University of Waterloo in Canada, said: \"First of all you have to think it's crazy, so that was my first thought. And you do always wonder if it's real.\n\n\"As far as sharing it with Gerard, of course he was my supervisor and mentor and he has taken CPA to great heights so he definitely deserves this award. And I'm so happy Art Ashkin also won.\"\n\nShe added: \"I think that he made so many discoveries early on that other people have done great things with that it's fantastic that he is finally recognised.\"\n\nIn a statement, the American Institute of Physics (AIP) offered its congratulations to all the winners, adding: \"The countless applications made possible by their work, like laser eye surgery, high-power pettawat lasers, and the ability to trap and study individual viruses and bacteria, only promise to increase going forward.\n\n\"It is also a personal delight to see Dr Strickland break the 55-year hiatus since a woman has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, making this year's award all the more historic.\"\n\nImage copyright SPL Image caption Mourou and Strickland's technique has found several applications, including in laser eye surgery\n\nWhat is the work that has won a Nobel?\n\nBefore Dr Strickland and Dr Mourou's pioneering work, the peak power of laser pulses was limited because, when cranked up to high intensities, they would destroy the material used for amplifying its energy.\n\nTo get round this, the researchers first stretched the laser pulses in time to reduce their peak power, then amplified them and finally compressed them.\n\nWhen a laser pulse is compressed in time and becomes shorter, more light is packed into a small space. This dramatically increases the intensity of the pulse.\n\nDr Strickland and Dr Mourou's technique, called chirped pulse amplification (CPA), became standard for high intensity lasers.\n\nArthur Ashkin realised an old dream in science fiction - using the radiation pressure of light to move physical objects. In doing so, he invented the optical tweezers that are today used to grab particles, atoms, viruses and living cells with their laser-based pincers.\n\nHe first worked on getting laser light to push small particles towards the centre of the beam and hold them there.\n\nThen, in 1987, he used the tweezers to capture living bacteria without harming them. The technique is now used widely to study the machinery of life.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter.\n\nPrevious winners of the Nobel Prize in Physics\n\nImage copyright S.Ossokine/A.Buonanno (MPI Gravitational Physics) Image caption A computer simulation of gravitational waves radiating from two merging black holes\n\n2017 - Rainer Weiss, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish earned the award for the detection of gravitational waves.\n\n2016 - David Thouless, Duncan Haldane and Michael Kosterlitz shared the award for their work on rare phases of matter.\n\n2015 - Takaaki Kajita and Arthur McDonald were awarded the prize the discovery that neutrinos switch between different \"flavours\".\n\n2014 - Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura won the physics Nobel for developing the first blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs).\n\n2013 - Francois Englert and Peter Higgs shared the spoils for formulating the theory of the Higgs boson particle.\n\n2012 - Serge Haroche and David J Wineland were awarded the prize for their work with light and matter."

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nNew plans were announced by the government today to ban restaurants from keeping any tips from staff.\n\nMost people assume serving staff get the full share of tips - but that's not always the case.\n\nA number of big chains have been criticised in recent years for taking a percentage of tips to cover administrative fees.\n\nHere, we break down what employees are entitled to and where your money goes when you tip.\n\nDo I need to tip?\n\nTipping is not automatically expected in the UK in the way it is in America, for example.\n\nEmployers are expected to pay the National Minimum Wage, but some waiting staff say that's not always enough to live on.\n\nSo, it's considered the polite thing to do at the end of a meal in many places.\n\nSo where does this money go?\n\nWell, this depends on a few things.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nA service charge is not the same as a tip\n\nA lot of people think it is.\n\nBut actually, that 10-15% extra added to your bill isn't the same as a tip and is generally optional.\n\nIn fact, there's no guarantee your waiter will see a penny of that service charge. It's often added to cover things like breakages and people doing a runner.\n\nA few big restaurant chains have been criticised for taking the bulk of the service charge to pay for administrative costs.\n\nCustomers can say they won't pay a service charge and leave a cash tip instead. They can also request for the charge to be taken off if they are unhappy with the service.\n\nTipping on card isn't the same as tipping in cash\n\nWith the rise of contactless, adding a little extra while paying on card can seem like the easiest way to tip.\n\nSome places pool these tips and share them out in a system called a \"tronc\".\n\nThe person who shares them out - known as the \"troncmaster\" - is not usually a member of management.\n\nBut some restaurants have been accused of taking tips paid on card, or charging employees a fee for tips paid on card.\n\nIn 2015, Pizza Express stopped deducting an 8% administration fee from staff tips paid on card after a public outcry.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Employees who get cash tips still have to pay tax on them\n\nYou still have to pay tax on tips\n\nLegally, employees have to tell the taxman exactly how much they make in tips so they pay tax on it.\n\nThey should keep a record of how much they make and declare it at the end of the tax year.\n\nWhat would the new rules change?\n\nCurrently, restaurants follow a voluntary code when it comes to tipping.\n\nBut they don't have any legal obligation to pass on all tips to workers.\n\nThe plans, announced by the Prime Minister Theresa May, would force high street chains to pass all tips to workers.\n\nSo that means no more deductions from tips paid on card.\n\nBut as this is a Conservative party conference announcement there's no guarantee this law will come in to force.\n\nLabour says the government's proposal copied another of its policies, which the party announced in June.\n\nJeremy Corbyn had said then that a Labour government would legislate to ensure workers keep 100% of their tips.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here."

    "text": "Our blue planet is facing one its biggest threats in human history. Trillions of pieces of plastic are choking the very lifeblood of our earth, and every marine animal, from the smallest plankton to the largest mammals, is being affected. But can we turn back this growing plastic tide before it is too late? In this 90-minute special, wildlife biologist Liz Bonnin visits scientists working at the cutting edge of plastics research. She works with some of the world's leading marine biologists and campaigners to discover the true dangers of plastic in our oceans and what it means for the future of all life on our planet, including us.\n\nLiz travels 10,000 miles to a remote island off the coast of Australia that is the nesting site for a population of seabirds called flesh-footed shearwaters. Newly hatched chicks are unable to regurgitate effectively, so they are filling up on deadly plastic. Then, in America, she joins an emergency mission to save an entangled grey seal pup found in some of the world's busiest fishing areas, and visits the Coral Triangle that stretches from Papua New Guinea to the Solomon Islands to find out more from top coral scientists trying to work out why plastic is so lethal to the reefs, fragile ecosystems that contain 25 per cent of all marine life.\n\nLiz learns that the world's biggest rivers have been turned into huge plastic arteries, transporting 50 per cent of all the plastic that arrives in the ocean. She travels to Indonesia, where she watches a horrifying raft of plastic rubbish travel down one of the main rivers, the Citarum. Here, 60 per cent of fish species have died, so fishermen are now forced to collect plastic to sell instead of fish.\n\nWith the world only now waking up to this emerging crisis, Liz also looks at whether scientists have found any solutions. She meets the 24-year-old inventor of a monumental 600-metre construction that will travel across the ocean's 'garbage patches' collecting millions of pieces of plastic pollution. She also meets a local environmental campaigner who is working with volunteers and the Indonesian army to clean up the worst affected areas, and a young entrepreneur who has invented an alternative to plastic packaging that is made from seaweed. Plastic in our oceans is one of the greatest environmental challenges of our time, and this film hopes to add to the urgent and vitally important debate about how to solve this global crisis."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "The Swedish word for autumn is h\u00f6st, the Danish use h\u00f8st and the German variation on the word is Herbst \u2013 all of which are derived from the Old Norse word haust, meaning \"to gather or pluck\" \u2013 still used by the Norwegians today.\n\nIn fact, until the 16th Century we were in the same club. The months between August and November, when the farmers gathered their crops for winter storage, were referred to simply as harvest. But, as more of the population swapped working the land for living in towns, the word lost its reference to the time of year and came to refer solely to the act of reaping crops."

When we returned in 2008, all these green moss beds had turned dark red, indicating they were severely stressed. It was a dramatic change.\n\n\"They change from green to red to grey if they get really stressed.\n\n\"The red pigments are the sunscreen and drought stress protective pigments they produce to protect themselves - antioxidant and UV screening compounds.\n\n\"Grey means they are dying.\"\n\nImage copyright University of Wollongong Image caption Stressed Antarctic mosses turn from green to red as they produce compounds to protect themselves.\n\nWhat is stressing and killing these mosses?\n\nThe scientists discovered evidence of a drying climate affecting the plants.\n\nWhen their study started, the moss beds were dominated by a species called Schistidium antarctici, which can survive long periods under water. By 2013, many of the beds the team studied were being encroached by two other moss species that thrive in drier conditions and are less tolerant to being submerged.\n\nEast Antarctica, the researchers say, has become colder, windier and drier due to the combined effects of climate change and ozone depletion.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Four things you should know about Antarctica\n\n\"The ozone hole has pulled the polar jet stream further south, increasing its strength,\" explained Prof Robinson. \"These winds isolate Antarctica and help to keep most of it cold as the rest of the world warms.\"\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nThe researchers say this is the first study to show that the plants in East Antarctica are being affected by climate change and ozone depletion.\n\nAntarctic mosses, the scientists point out, are the only plants that can survive in East Antarctica. \"We like to think of them as miniature, old growth forests,\" said Prof Robinson.\n\nHer co-author, Dr Melinda Waterman explained that by dating the mosses, the researchers could tell \"they have been growing here for hundreds of years\".\n\n\"As they grow, the mosses preserve a record of how dry or wet the environment is along their shoots - preserving a record of Antarctic coastal climate over the centuries,\" she explained.\n\nProf Robinson added: \"[They might be only] 4-14 cm tall, but [the moss beds] are home to tiny animals and fungi and lichens and algal cells - think of them as a forest and at least 40% of it is suffering drought.\n\n\"The mosses are our sentinel for the whole ecosystem.\"\n\nFollow Victoria on Twitter"

Levi picked the T.rex costume for the family photo shoot after finding previous portraits overwhelming\n\nSnapping a family portrait can be an unpleasant experience for anyone, but for children with autism, the stress can be overwhelming.\n\nThat's the case for eight-year-old Levi, who lives in Georgia with his mum Samantha Bishop, 26.\n\nFor years, it's taken as long as two hours to get a family picture, but last week it took the pair only 20 minutes to take the perfect photo.\n\nHow did they do it? By dressing up as dinosaur T.rex.\n\nThe images have warmed many hearts on internet forum Reddit where it was upvoted more than 123,000 times.\n\n\"This is the best thing ever! Our daughter is on the spectrum and always wears either a unicorn horn or Eevee ears everywhere we go. It's so awesome creating a life and space for our kids to stretch into themselves and not worry about petty rules like picture etiquette or that costumes are only for Halloween,\" wrote one contributor.\n\n\"This is what family photos should be about. Everyone's happy at the end, and makes for great stories later,\" commented another.\n\nIt also sparked debate about how to make family portraits a fun experience for autistic children.\n\n\"A lot of things can be difficult for Levi. Taking a picture usually involves a lot of bribery and a lot of dancing,\" Samantha, a professional photographer who runs her own business, told the BBC.\n\nLevi is very self-conscious, and he usually finds going in front of a camera very uncomfortable.\n\nWhen his mum asks him to smile or pose, he replies \"mum, don't tell me what to do with my face. I don't know what I'm meant to be doing\".\n\nThe longer it goes on, the more agitated he gets.\n\n\"I felt like we were forcing something on him that was uncomfortable for him. He didn't enjoy them and they weren't real smiles from him - they were forced and fake. Out of 5,000 photos, I may have had 10 great ones,\" Samantha explained.\n\nImage copyright Roaming Magnolias Image caption Levi and Lola had a great time together at the photo shoot\n\nSo this year, when Levi suggested he could dress up as one of his favourite characters, Samantha said yes.\n\n\"He loved it, he was laughing hysterically, and he was super-excited,\" she explained about the photo shoot of Levi and his niece Lola, who is his \"best friend\".\n\nWhen she posted the pictures online, she received criticism from some parents for making Levi's autism a focus.\n\n\"So while many people don't see why his autism or other special needs have anything to do with this shoot, I think many will. This is him in his element. There are no forced smiles, no bribery, no pretend happiness,\" she wrote in response on their Facebook page Life with Levi.\n\n\"And so I choose to celebrate his 'labels' and teach him to use them to his advantage rather than see them as an obstacle.\"\n\nImage copyright Samantha Bishop\n\nAs a photographer, Samantha says a lot of families tell her they have never managed to take a family portrait because their autistic child finds sitting still and posing too difficult.\n\nHer solution is to let the children take the lead.\n\n\"If parents would just let the kids be themselves, it would be OK - they don't need the picture-perfect smile or moment, but if their child is happy, they will get the picture they want.\"\n\nLevi and Lola are already thinking about their costumes for the next photo shoot - they've picked Ghostbusters.\n\nBy Georgina Rannard, BBC UGC & Social News"

    "text": "Image caption Not laughing now: Rob Delaney says he'd prefer his kids to be 'frolicking and drawing'\n\nAre children getting too much homework in the UK? Comedian and actor Rob Delaney thinks so.\n\n\"Why do they give seven-year-olds so much homework in the UK and how do I stop this?\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nHis comments sparked a social media debate and other celebrities were soon weighing in with their thoughts.\n\nMany agreed with the star of the Channel 4 sitcom Catastrophe, who lives in London with his wife and two sons.\n\nHe said: \"I want my kid frolicking and drawing and playing football. Who knows more about stopping this madness and can help me?\"\n\nThe American also suggested parents who called for more homework weren't fond of their offspring.\n\nMatch of the Day presenter Gary Lineker, a father of four, agreed with Delaney, calling homework a \"waste of time\".\n\nHe said it brought stress to the home, child, parents and their relationship.\n\nDelaney also received support from fellow comedians, and fathers, Romesh Ranganathan and Jason Manford.\n\nManford pointed out that it was often the parents who ended up doing it, saying he spent three hours on a Sunday cutting things out of magazines and researching animal teeth.\n\nAnd it wasn't just celebrities who joined in the debate.\n\nOne Twitter user, Alison Waller, said she refused to spend weekends doing homework with her eight-year-old.\n\nShe added: \"Playing in the park yes, baking yes, chatting yes etc. Learning comes in many forms.\"\n\nAnother, Chris Walsh, said his child's primary school had put an end to homework after parents intervened.\n\nHowever, there were some dissenting voices - led by Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan, who said lazy parents would agree with Lineker.\n\nHe added: \"Most parents understand that homework, if well organised, plays an important part in their children's education.\"\n\nIn response, Julian Thomas, head of independent school Wellington College, said the real discussion should be about the quality of homework.\n\nHe tweeted: \"The reason homework causes such stress is because too much of it is mind-numbing and of little educational value.\"\n\nSo where does the government stand?\n\nIn 1998 the government introduced guidelines in England and Wales recommending an hour a week for five to seven-year-olds, rising to half an hour a night for seven to 11-year-olds.\n\nThe year before this advice was brought in just over six in every 10 primary schools made their pupils do homework, according to the Institute of Education.\n\nA year after the guidelines came in, this had risen to around nine in 10 primary schools and the majority still set homework now.\n\nLabour's advice was scrapped in England in 2012 and schools now have more flexibility to design systems to suit their own students.\n\nSchools also have the power to decide in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nSo if Delaney is serious about wanting to reduce his child's workload, his school's head teacher should expect a knock on the door."

    "text": "Image copyright Ashe Walker\n\nAn Absolutely Remarkable Thing by Hank Green might not initially sound Absolutely Remarkable.\n\n\"It's about a young woman, who is coming out of college, starting her life in the workforce, trying to figure out who she is and what she's going to be,\" the vlogger and author tells the BBC.\n\nSounds pretty normal so far, right? Well that's where the relatability ends.\n\nBecause then, when protagonist April May (yes, really) makes her way home from work, she stumbles across a massive robot, dubbed Carl, in the middle of the street and naturally, calls up her friend Andy to film and upload it online.\n\nBeing the first to report on the scene, the pair become internet sensations overnight, and when more Carls pop up across the world, April becomes the face of this futuristic phenomenon, quickly learning about the cost of fame in the age of social media.\n\nAs one half of YouTube channel VlogBrothers, which has more than three million subscribers, and co-creator of VidCon - one of the biggest events in your favourite YouTuber's social calendar - it's safe to say that Hank is well-equipped to write about internet fame.\n\n\"I've always wanted to write a book,\" he says. \"And it turned out that it was more about finding a story that I felt I was necessary for, that no-one else could write.\"\n\nWhile there are already plenty of books depicting the life-changing effects of becoming a social media star, Green's take on the matter goes a little deeper, as we see April's obsession with being the centre of the story become the source of her downfall.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption First held in 2010, VidCon now sees over 20,000 vloggers and fans across several continents\n\nBy the time Green became popular on the internet, he was 28 years old, married and says he felt he had established his identity.\n\n\"When I was watching 19 and 20-year-olds go through this, dropping out of college to become famous on the internet, I saw that it can go well but it can also go poorly, and usually it'll be a mix of those two things,\" he ponders.\n\n\"I wasn't here to tell a wish fulfilment story and walk through the process of how great it is to be famous on the internet; it can really suck sometimes.\"\n\n\"And I could never publicly be like 'Here's an essay on why being a famous, rich, internet creator sucks!', but you can say it from the perspective of a character who you've been invited into seeing the world through.\"\n\nBeing admired by millions of viewers who latch onto each and every one of your videos may seem like the modern-day dream, but as readers see through April's journey, no matter how many followers you have, it can still be quite isolating - especially when trying to keep those followers.\n\n\"When the number of followers feels like it's shrinking, it feels like such a tremendous loss and such a hit to your self-worth,\" he says.\n\n\"It's very difficult not to tie your self-worth to the size of your audience and and I've watched a lot of people do things that they know are not good things to do, in order to keep those numbers high because they're protecting their self-worth, and I watched April do that as well and it's tough.\"\n\nOne major aspect of social media and the internet is being able to curate our profiles and feeds to reflect our personalities. Or is it?\n\nIn the book, we see April slowly branding herself as the face of humanity, where she notes that \"being annoyed by carefully crafted internet personas\" was part of her carefully crafted internet persona.\n\nWhich raises the question, can anyone truly be authentic online?\n\nHank laughs, saying that that's one of his favourite parts of the book too.\n\n\"That question comes down to whether anyone can truly be authentic,\" he explains.\n\n\"We have always done this, we have different ways we portray ourselves to different people and have different ways we think about ourselves internally and ideas we have inside of our heads we'd never share,\" he says.\n\n\"And when you do pretend to be a certain way, you eventually become that way.\n\n\"So what is the self? Basically we've now gotten to one of the root questions of philosophy. And it didn't take very long to go from 'can you be authentic on the internet?' to 'what is the self?', so I don't know how to answer that one.\"\n\nFrom politics and internet trolls to world-dominating robots and meetings with the president, it's almost as if this book is ready for a Netflix adaptation.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Hank's brother John (centre) had his novel Paper Towns adapted for the big screen\n\nHank's older brother John Green - author of Paper Towns and The Fault In Our Stars - is already pretty familiar with making the leap from the page to the silver screen but for now, he'd like to work on the sequel.\n\n\"I want to be done with the sequel before I think about the movie because I don't want all of that stuff to stand in the way of writing,\" he says.\n\n\"I really need to write book two and that's really important to me, to see this story through to the end,\" he says.\n\nSo while we won't be seeing April and Carl come to life any time soon, he did pick up a few tips from John.\n\n\"I would occasionally talk with John about a plot problem I have, like when I want something in the book to happen but I'm can't figure out how to get there.\"\n\n\"I remember John saying 'If you are writing and it's bad, that's better than not writing at all, you will look back and you'll see that you found something even if you're gonna delete everything you wrote today, you will have learned something that's useful and it's going to make the book better'.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

But you're probably not expecting to become a meme.\n\nThat's what happened to Patrick Richie and Lucia Gorman when they went on a night out in Edinburgh.\n\nLucia looks unimpressed with whatever Patrick was yelling into her ear over the music.\n\nRadio 1 Newsbeat spoke to the two 18-year-olds about what it feels like to become a meme, and what was being said.\n\nBut first, let's enjoy what the internet has done with the image.\n\nWe've got animal references...\n\n...pop culture...\n\n...political mansplaining...\n\n...historical world affairs...\n\n...and Eurovision.\n\nYou know, all the usual subjects you cover on a normal night out.\n\nA lot of the jokes revolve around Lucia looking like she's the victim of unwanted attention.\n\nWhen Newsbeat caught up with Patrick, he joked: \"That doesn't look good for me, does it?\"\n\nActually, the two were at school together and hadn't seen each other for a while - the now famous photo was taken as they were having a quick catch up.\n\nLucia admits she was pretty much ready to go home - which explains her expression.\n\n\"I don't know what he said but I know I definitely wasn't having any of it,\" she told Newsbeat.\n\n\"I feel like it was probably the end of the night and I was definitely ready for my bed.\n\n\"I probably just thought, 'I'll nod at anything at this point'.\"\n\nNeither of them knew the photo existed until it began going viral.\n\nThe photo was taken by David Wilkinson who was at the club for an event with Love Island star Jack Fowler.\n\n\"When I took the picture, it was just a quick snap before I left to go home,\" he tells Newsbeat.\n\n\"I don't like just taking pictures of people smiling. I like to notice the little details, so when I saw it I thought this definitely needs to go up.\n\n\"The day that it blew up it was my birthday, but I actually got more messages about the picture than I did about my birthday so it was quite weird.\"\n\nLucia, a student at Strathclyde University, said she does PR for the same club night, called Milk, in Glasgow - but insists this was no PR stunt.\n\n\"I can understand if people thought this is all for PR, but the first person to tweet it wasn't anyone to do with Milk - it was someone who goes to school with our friends,\" she said.\n\nNow, even her grandparents have seen the photo.\n\n\"It's all pretty funny to be honest,\" she said.\n\nWhile Patrick says the attention is pretty weird, he isn't that bothered.\n\n\"I'm sure it'll all be fine,\" he said.\n\nHe added: \"You obviously can't hear people in these places so you speak to them like that all the time.\"\n\nAnd have they learnt anything from the experience?\n\n\"I probably wouldn't have worn that shirt if I'd known I was going viral, I guess,\" said Patrick.\n\n\"But\u2026 nah, not really. It's just one of those things.\"\n\nLucia said: \"I'm just glad I did my make-up that night.\"\n\nShe added: \"What I should have learnt, actually, is to scrub my tan properly, because if you zoom into the photo I have this rash on my neck and the tan is on that, and everyone is commenting like her tan's awful.\n\n\"That's something I've learnt - invest in good fake tan.\"\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here."

    "text": "Image caption Royal Mail is obliged by law to deliver packets to Walkers' freepost address\n\nRoyal Mail has stepped into a row between campaigners and crisp makers Walkers - by urging people posting empty packets to put them in envelopes.\n\nCampaigners asked people to post the non-recyclable plastic bags and \"flood Walkers social media with pictures of us popping them in the post\".\n\nRoyal Mail is obliged by law to deliver the bags to Walkers' freepost address.\n\nBut without envelopes they cannot go through machines and must be sorted by hand, causing delays.\n\nA Royal Mail spokesperson said: \"We strongly encourage customers not to post anything into the postal system which is not properly packaged.\n\n\"Crisp packets can't go through the machines, they are not normal mail items therefore my hardworking colleagues need to manually sort them, which adds to time.\"\n\nPeople have been taking selfies of themselves posting the crisp packets and putting them on social media with the hashtag #PacketInWalkers.\n\nIt follows a petition hosted by 38 Degrees which called for Walkers to make their packets recyclable.\n\nCathy Warren, campaigner at 38 Degrees, said: \"Royal Mail have asked people to use envelopes when posting crisp packets and we will update the thousands of Walkers's customers who are taking part.\n\n\"Up and down the country, people are telling Walkers to step up when it comes to plastic waste.\n\n\"Walkers produce a staggering 7,000 plastic crisp packets a minute which they don't pay a penny to clean up. They need to listen to their customers and take action now.\"\n\nRoyal Mail said it had handled about 30 crisp packets so far.\n\nAre the alternatives any better?\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Walkers crisps are packaged in metallised plastic film\n\nSusan Selke, director of the School of Packaging at Michigan State University, said crisps needed a very good oxygen barrier because of their high fat content and other packaging alternatives may have greater overall environmental impacts.\n\n\"From looking at the Walkers website, it appears that their packaging is similar to that used for the majority of snack foods,\" she said.\n\nSuch products are commonly packaged in metallised PET or metallised PP, which are both metallised films.\n\n\"Because of their fat content and the potential for rancidity, chips [crisps] need a good oxygen barrier,\" said Dr Selke.\n\n\"The old alternative was paper or plastic laminated to aluminium foil, usually coated on the inside with a plastic layer for heat-sealing. This structure would also not be accepted for recycling in most cases, is much heavier, and will have greater overall environmental impacts, for a variety of reasons, so it would not be an improvement.\"\n\nShe said more rigid packaging could be used to provide a good oxygen barrier but this would result in more material being used.\n\n\"Several studies have shown that most of the environmental impact comes at the production end, not the disposal end, so again overall environmental impact would likely be increased with these alternatives, even if recycling went up,\" said Dr Selke.\n\nWalkers said its packaging had been designed to keep its snacks fresh and prevent food waste.\n\nThe Leicester-based crisp manufacturer confirmed it had started receiving crisp packets and claimed it would use them \"for research\".\n\n\"We recognise the efforts being made to bring the issue of packaging waste to our attention,\" a spokesperson added.\n\n\"The returned packets will be used in our research, as we work towards our commitment of improving the recyclability of our packaging.\"\n\nIt has pledged to make all its packaging 100% recyclable, compostable or biodegradable by 2025.\n\nIt is piloting compostable packaging in the US, India and Chile."

Well done Meghan,\" the Sun's royal correspondent Emily Andrews tweeted.\n\nWell and truly over-shadowing the main event - which was an opening of an exhibition of works from the Oceania region - the door soon became a Twitter moment.\n\nThe feminist and former UN advocate has form for this sort of behaviour.

However, it was not verified to have been the Duchess herself.\n\nThere are, however, certain rules Meghan won't be breaking.\n\n\"Now that Meghan is a member of the royal family, there's no more selfies, no more autographs, she can't vote and all public social media has to be deleted,\" William Hanson told Newsbeat.\n\nYou may also like:"

    "authors": [
      "Angela Saini"

    "text": "An orangutan named Rocky has become the first to mimic human speech, and is shedding exciting new light on the origins of how we talk.\n\nGreat apes are a branch of primates that include chimps, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans. They\u2019re important to scientists because they\u2019re closer to humans than any other animals. When they do things that humans can, we gain insights into how we may have evolved.\n\n\"Great apes are really good at this game of 'do as I do,\u2019\" says anthropologist Dr Adriano Lameira at Durham University, one of the team of researchers who helped to coach 11-year-old Rocky. When they changed their tone or pitch, Rocky would change his. They have dubbed his unique sounds \u2013 unlike anything an orangutan would normally make \u2013 \u2018wookies,\u2019 after the fictional Star Wars species to which Chewbacca belongs. This discovery, published in the journal Scientific Reports, promises to open a fresh window on the origins of human speech.\n\nRocky's voice control gives clues to early human speech\n\nLanguage is one of the biggest mysteries of evolution. Scientists have yet to figure out why humans and other primates have so much in common, but do not share the ability to talk. However, primates like Rocky reveal that we may be more alike than we\u2019d thought.\n\nUntil recently, scientists believed primates couldn\u2019t imitate humans. Attempts to teach chimps and bonobos to speak had failed, so researchers had assumed primate calls must be a reflex, similar to laughter or crying in humans, as they are often a response to threat. Yet Rocky\u2019s remarkable ability shows that orangutans can control tone and pitch in their voices after all, so they must have the basic physical machinery for speech.\n\nThe human language puzzle has lots of pieces, but being able to use our vocal chords to make different sounds is an important one.\n\n\"The traditional view was that maybe we were the only ape to develop spoken language because we had the necessary motor control. Given that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case, we need to start thinking about new factors to explain what might have propelled a vocal system in our lineage so quickly as to lead to spoken language.\"\n\nOrangutans in captivity make lots of different sounds, although nobody knows where they pick them up.\n\n\"Some know how to whistle, some babble. They do amazingly different things,\" Lameira says.\n\nAnother key piece of the puzzle is \u2018vocal learning\u2019, which is the ability to learn new calls. One idea, developed by linguist Professor Shigeru Miyagawa at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US, is that human speech emerged from two different offshoots of animal communication. One is the simple word-like calls primates make. The other is the sentence-like melodies we find among songbirds. Primates don\u2019t speak in sentences and birds don\u2019t use meaningful words, but somehow these come together in humans. Although the last common ancestor of humans and birds lived 250 million years ago, there\u2019s evidence that they both still share genes that are linked to vocal learning.\n\nPrimatologist Dr Esther Clarke, of Durham University, has boosted Miyagawa\u2019s hypothesis by investigating the songs sung by gibbons, another species of ape.\n\n\"I would say they have elements of birdsong,\" she says. Just like birds, the individual notes carry no meaning, but the order in which they\u2019re sung by gibbons is important.\n\n\"Gibbons seem to have a really limited repertoire, like other primates, but they impose these subtle changes within the types of calls they make. And these seem to have different meanings,\" Clarke explains.\n\nPsychologist Dr Katie Slocombe of the University of York has shown that chimpanzees have some flexibility in their voices, too, making different noises to refer to certain foods. According to Slocombe and her team, a group of chimps that moved from the Netherlands to Edinburgh to join an existing group ended up changing their call for apples, from a high-pitched sound to a low-pitched grunt. They believe their calls began to match as the chimps got to know each other over the course of a few years.\n\nDoes this mean that Rocky the orangutan might eventually be able to learn to speak like a human?\n\n\"The basic capacities are present, but they\u2019re probably latent,\" says Lameira. The problem is that, even if apes and monkeys do have the necessary vocal machinery to make the right noises, scientists don\u2019t understand what makes them want to vocalise in the first place.\n\nWhile humans connect voices to thought, primates don\u2019t seem to do this. They\u2019re often better at using their hands and bodies to communicate. Lameira explains that orangutans need to be studied further in the wild to understand what, in their environment, motivates them to make calls. Once this is understood, it may be possible to teach such an ape as Rocky to \u2018talk\u2019, under the right conditions.\n\n\"Not talk like us, because that is a sum of many capacities together,\" he says. But he could be taught vowel and consonant sounds, and how to combine them into syllables.\n\nSo the puzzle isn\u2019t complete, but it is becoming clearer.\n\n\"We can find different pieces, the precursors to language, but we haven\u2019t found anything we would necessarily equate with full language,\" says Clarke.\n\nBut words alone don\u2019t equal human speech. Languages have grammar and syntax, which some believe may even be hardwired into the human brain. If other primates are born with this special skill, nobody has seen evidence of it yet.\n\nSign-up for the BBC Earth newsletter\n\nExplore more of BBC Earth\n\nBy Angela Saini\n\nFeatured image by Kyle Lansdell"

    "text": "Image copyright Rajiv Srivastava\n\nIndia's 100th airport, inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the northern-eastern state of Sikkim on Monday, is arguably one of the world's most beautiful.\n\nSikkim, a tiny former kingdom in the Himalayas, is home to Kanchenjunga, the world's third-highest mountain. The state is connected to Tibet, Bhutan and Nepal through eight mountain passes.\n\nThe state's first airport at Pakyong, some 30km (18 miles) from the state capital, Gangtok, and carved out of a mountainside has been described as an \"engineering marvel\".\n\nImage copyright Rajiv Srivastava\n\nSome 60km from the border with China, the airport is located on top of a hill above Pakyong village at 4,500ft (1,371 metres) above sea level and it's spread across over 201 acres.\n\nImage copyright Rajiv Srivastava\n\nThe airport is flanked by deep valleys at both ends of the 1.75km-long runway. It has two parking bays and a terminal building, which can handle about 100 passengers at a time.\n\nDifficult topography and hostile weather conditions made this nine-year-long project \"extremely challenging and exciting\", according to a spokesperson for Punj Lloyd, an Indian company which built the runway.\n\nImage copyright Rajiv Srivastava\n\nEngineers say the main challenge was to carry out heavy earthwork construction at the site and lug equipment through narrow mountain roads. The weather - Sikkim gets monsoon rains from April to September - hindered work.\n\nThe hilly terrain and high seismicity were among some of the other challenges engineers faced on the rocky slopes.\n\nImage copyright Rajiv Srivastava\n\nThe entire airport, including the runway, has been built on land which was itself created by building an embankment wall as high as 263ft in deep valleys. Punj Lloyd says it is one of the tallest \"reinforcement\" walls in the world.\n\nImage copyright Rajiv Srivastava\n\nCommercial flight operations from Pakyong will begin on 4 October.\n\nThe airport is expected to boost tourism to Sikkim, which is home to a number of peaks, glaciers and high altitude lakes.\n\nPhotographs by Rajiv Srivastava"

    ],
    "text": "Autumn is well and truly upon us. The leaves are starting to fall, the nights are drawing in and migratory species are heading for foreign lands. Over the next few weeks we'll lose our swallows and house martins. As well as being one of nature's most incredible spectacles, autumn brings a few more delights to look forward to.\n\n1. The leaves start falling from the trees As the days get shorter, our pavements turn a reddy brown and it'll probably take an extra few minutes to get to work because you're looking for extra crunchy leaves to step on. Only deciduous trees start to lose their leaves. The process is one that helps trees conserve resources during the colder months and makes them more resistant to windy conditions during winter.\n\n2. Conkers start appearing Aside from the traditional image of schoolchildren battling one another, conkers have a useful purpose. They're the seeds of a horse chestnut tree, helping it to replant and survive many generations. A common myth is that they can be eaten by horses. However, they're poisonous to the species and not suitable for humans to digest either. One species that is able to use them as a food source is deer.\n\n3. Hedgerows come alive! From the start of September hedgerows are heavily laden with all kinds of berries. Blackberries are a favourite with foragers and wildlife alike. They're an important source of food for birds such as thrushes, redwings and blackbirds. It looks like harvest mice are pretty interested in them too!\n\n4. Dramatic sky dances During the autumn and winter months, starlings put on a stunning display as the sun sets. Hundreds of the birds gather in the sky to produce stunning murmurations. There are a number of reasons for the activity, including staying warm. It also makes it much harder for predators to attack, safety in numbers. Starlings are known for being noisy birds and during murmurations is no exception: they use the time to share information about good feeding sites.\n\n5. Jack Frost leaves his mark You know it's really autumn when the morning air is crisp and cold, when you can see your breath as you defrost the car, and then the early morning dew is still settled on the grass. As we crank up our thermostats and wrap up warm in preparation for the chill, some species have a tougher time. One way you can help them is by building a compost heap. The warmth generated by matter decomposing makes the ideal habitat for reptiles which are in turn a good food source for small mammals. Learn more about how to do so here.\n\n6. Misty mornings Is it really autumn without mist rising in the valleys and the sun peaking through? Here comes the science bit! Mist is formed when tiny droplets of water are suspended in the air. It happens as warmer water in the air cools quickly. This forces it to change from a gas to small visible water particles. It often happens when the air over water suddenly comes into contact with colder surfaces on land. It's differentiated from fog by how much its density restricts visibility; fewer than 100m it's mist, more than that it's fog."

Among all ages, the figure was 29%. We meet three couples who, while madly in love, fall into this category.\n\n\"Our lack of sex life at the moment is down to me,\" Amanda, 35, tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.\n\n\"I'm so tired all the time because my job is full on and it's full on at home. It's like my libido is tired.\"\n\nAmanda and Steve have been married for six years.\n\nWatching their 22-month-old son, Elliott, happily marching around the room, they laugh to one another as they explain why they now have sex about once every six weeks.\n\n\"Daytime sex and afternoon sex - with a kid around that's not happening,\" says Steve, from London.\n\n\"Even if you put him down for a nap for two hours, you're just kind of like, 'I should probably do other stuff or catch up on some sleep.'\"\n\nBut it is not just parents having less satisfying sex lives, according to counsellor and sex therapist Martin Burrow, from the organisation Relate.\n\nImage caption Amanda and Steve struggle to find the time and energy to have sex\n\n\"We certainly seem to be seeing more people reporting that they are dissatisfied in their sexual relationship,\" he says.\n\n\"Whether that's a cultural shift in people being more comfortable to talk about sex or whether people are having less sex, I'm not sure.\n\n\"You can have a successful relationship whether there is sex in it or not.\n\n\"Some people don't need to have sex to be happy - some people do.\"\n\nJacob and Charlotte, both 23, are very much in love - but sex is not part of their relationship.\n\n\"We've been together for four years. We haven't had sex for the last three of them - and we're not planning to,\" Charlotte says.\n\nShe is asexual, though Jacob is not.\n\n\"We sort of tried [having sex] to see what worked for the first six months. It really wasn't making either of us happy.\n\n\"Jacob doesn't want to be having sex with someone who doesn't want to be having sex.\"\n\nFor some men, this might have been a deal-breaker - but not for Jacob.\n\n\"I have a fantastic relationship with a wonderful person,\" he says. \"There are other ways to show affection.\"\n\nOthers, however, are not always as understanding.\n\nCharlotte says: \"I don't think I can have a conversation with someone about it without it being implied [not having sex is a] burden that's been put on me, when actually it's a choice I've made.\n\n\"It's really sad how some people prioritise sex over happiness.\"\n\nImage caption Steve and Thom, who are married, have never had sex\n\nThom and Steve, from Bristol, have been together for four years, and got married last year. They have never had sex with each other.\n\nBoth identify as asexual and joke that their first date - when they ended up sleeping next to one another - was \"one of the best one-night stands we've both had where nothing has happened\".\n\nThom believes society is becoming increasingly sexualised but this is \"not reflective of people having more sex\".\n\nAlthough he adds: \"There's more pressure to have sex and maybe people are forcing themselves to have more regular sex\".\n\nThe couple say people are shocked when they say they have never had sex, and often ask how they can love each other without it.\n\nThe reply they give is simple: \"You can have sex without the love, so why can't love without sex exist?\"\n\nImage caption Dr Martin Burrow says couples can be intimate without having sex\n\nFor Martin, when it comes to the amount of sex in relationships, \"normal doesn't exist\".\n\nSome couples, he says, can \"reach high levels of intimacy without having sex\".\n\nFor others, the amount of sex they have will often ebb and flow, affected by things such as having young children, work, fatigue and illness.\n\nAmanda says communication between her and Steve has been the key to having a healthy and strong relationship without regular sex.\n\n\"Don't be too disheartened,\" she advises new parents in a similar position, \"because it happens to all of us.\"\n\nShe laughs as she turns to Steve and says: \"We will get it back. I promise.\"\n\nWatch the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 BST on BBC Two and the BBC News channel in the UK and on iPlayer afterwards."

    ],
    "text": "Most people are trying their best to recycle plastic - but the many different ways in which recycling is collected by councils across the UK has left them confused over what can be recycled and what can't.\n\nNew plans on how plastic is recycled in England are being put forward by the government. In the rest of the UK, the strategy for recycling is a devolved issue.\n\nEach council collects its plastic recycling differently. BBC analysis shows there are 39 different sets of rules for what can be put in plastic recycling collections:\n\nMost collect bottles\n\nOthers collect pots, tubs and trays\n\nSome collect a much wider range\n\nWhat can be recycled in your area? Go to the recyclenow website Group 8 Created with Sketch.\n\nAround the UK, all four nations are hoping to improve their recycling rates. The review sticks to the aim that 50% of waste will be recycled by 2020 and aims to recycle three quarters of plastic packaging by 2035.\n\nScotland has a target to recycle 70% of waste by 2025, as does Wales. Northern Ireland has a proposal that 60% of municipal waste is recycled by 2020.\n\nWaste plastic is collected in different ways too:\n\nSome local authorities collect all their recycling in one bin\n\nOthers ask households to separate their plastics from the rest of their recycling\n\nCouncils also employ many different companies to collect and sort their plastics.\n\nAnd having different recycling schemes in different areas - for example, in some areas you can recycle margarine tubs and in other areas you cannot - makes labelling difficult.\n\nMost people in Britain regularly recycle plastic but almost half have had disagreements at home about what type they can put in which bin, a ComRes poll for the BBC suggests.\n\nAnd more than a quarter have these disagreements at least once a month.\n\nHow is the government proposing to tackle plastic recycling?\n\nTackle the current postcode recycling lottery under which different materials are recyclable in different areas\n\nIntroduce consistent labelling on packaging so consumers know what they can recycle\n\nMake the firms that produce materials responsible for the cost of disposing of those items\n\nEncourage manufacturers to design products that last longer and increase the levels of repair and re-use\n\nCrack down on waste crime by introducing electronic tracking of waste shipments\n\nIntroduce a tax on plastic packaging made of less than 30% recycled plastic\n\nBan plastic packaging where an alternative material could be used\n\nImprove the quality of plastic being exported\n\nPlastic can often become too contaminated for recycling and have to be sent to landfill or incinerated instead. This happens for several reasons:\n\nPeople are confused about what goes in which bin\n\nPeople are not always very careful about what they put in\n\nThe plastic is contaminated with food waste\n\nIn areas where all recycling is collected in one bin, one type of waste can contaminate another\n\nBottles are mainly made of PET and HDPE and these are easy to collect and recycle\n\nMost trays are made from polypropylene and this is pretty easy to recycle too but not all councils have access to the right facilities\n\nLDPE, used to make some carrier bags and cling film, is easy to process but more difficult to sort and can often be contaminated with food\n\nPolystyrene, used to make some yoghurt pots and plastic cutlery, is not widely recycled\n\nPVC makes up small amount of packaging but can contaminate other plastic recycling\n\nBiscuit wrappers and meat trays can be made from a mixture of many different types of plastic, making them the most difficult type of packaging to recycle\n\nAll plastic can be recycled - but it is not always economical to do so.\n\nBottles attract the best prices, especially clear ones, which is why almost all councils recycle them\n\nColoured plastic is less desirable because the colour cannot be removed, restricting its reuse\n\nPolystyrene is almost never recycled because there is no market for it\n\nMost bottles will be sent for reprocessing in this country.\n\nBut plastic that is less valuable - about two-thirds collected for recycling - goes overseas and this figure has been rising.\n\nEarlier this year, the National Audit Office reported the plastic sent abroad could be highly contaminated, meaning it may not be reprocessed and could end up in landfill or contributing to pollution.\n\nSome countries are refusing to take any more of our waste.\n\nChina, Malaysia, and Vietnam have banned waste imports\n\nThailand will introduce a ban in 2021\n\nThese bans are having an effect on the prices paid for waste plastic.\n\nAnd this year the prices of the more contaminated plastics have fallen below zero, meaning companies are now expecting to be paid to take them away.\n\nDesign: Debie Loizou.

By 2020, it is expected sugar will be reduced by 20%.\n\nPHE chief nutritionist Dr Alison Tedstone said this showed \"positive steps\" were being made.\n\nBut Dr Bernadette Moore, lead researcher of this study, said: \"Even if we take the reduction into account, most of these yoghurts will still not be low in sugar.\n\n\"I think people, including parents, will be surprised to know just how much sugar there is in yoghurt.\n\n\"My advice would be to buy natural yoghurt and mix in your own fruit.\"\n\nRead more from Nick\n\nFollow Nick on Twitter"

    "authors": [],
    "text": "Media playback is not supported on this device Prince Harry's bold opening gambit to Peter Crouch.\n\nPeter Crouch - 42 caps for England, scorer of more than 100 Premier League goals, does a funny robot celebration, married to Abbey Clancy.\n\nThat Peter Crouch Podcast offered plenty of the striker's unique insight into life as a Premier League footballer, as well as including stories about Prince Harry, Brooklyn Beckham... and Sven-Goran Eriksson playing the piano.\n\nHere are 10 things you probably did not know about him.\n\nYou can download and subscribe here or via your usual podcast provider.\n\n1. He invented a famous cookery programme format\n\nI was at Portsmouth, hanging out with Shaun Derry and Courtney Pitt. We lived in each other's pockets, and so we used to cook for each other.\n\nWe were eating out all the time as professional footballers, and we had to nip it in the bud. So we used to take the trolley round the supermarket. Whoever was cooking would get what they wanted. And then we'd rate each other.\n\nThis is before Come Dine With Me. I basically invented Come Dine With Me.\n\nMy speciality? Chicken with stir-in pasta. I used to throw in the pasta bows and then cut up the chicken myself. It wasn't top notch.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Peter Crouch: Inventor of Come Dine With Me?\n\n2. Prince Harry once delivered the ultimate put-down\n\nI've met the princes a few times. I remember Harry said to me once - we were in the England changing-room - and he said: \"Crouchie! How did you bag Abbey?\"\n\nHe genuinely said that. He was dissing me, for sure, and then laughing his head off as he walked off.\n\nI looked around and said: \"Did that just happen?\"\n\nI was taken aback at the time. But I told Abbey afterwards, and she was buzzing.\n\n3. Sven-Goran Eriksson and his former assistant Tord Grip are one of music's great undiscovered duos\n\nTord Grip was incredible at the accordion.\n\nWe got back from an England game one night, and I just peeked into the bar. I heard some music. Sven was on the piano, tickling the ivories, and Tord was on the accordion. Tord was amazing.\n\n4. He beat a Beckham at ping-pong at the 2006 World Cup\n\nWe were staying in Baden-Baden in Germany at the 2006 World Cup.\n\nThere wasn't a great deal to do. Victoria Beckham was obviously at lots of the games, and so one night I ended up playing table-tennis with a seven-year-old Brooklyn.\n\nI put him to bed.\n\n5. He rates himself on football computer games\n\nIt's a difficult one. I'd like to think I'm better in real life, but I do get some goals. I get people tweeting me all the time about great goals I've scored on Fifa.\n\nIt's quite life-like - I've got absolutely no pace, but I can bang them in every now and then.\n\n6. He is paranoid about his financial security\n\nI have a different signature for my bank card and my autograph. If someone had my autograph and then found my bank card, I'd be a little bit worried about fraud. Although I am a relatively hard man to imitate.\n\nTipping when you have room service is a difficult thing. They've already got your bank card. So I put the pound sign, and then the fiver, really close. So that they can't add another digit.\n\nIf I put \u00a310, they could put another one in there, so it read \u00a3110. I'm just thinking ahead. I could end up doing \u00a3110 on a plate of chicken nuggets.\n\n7. He had a pet named after an ex-Chelsea striker\n\nIt was a rabbit. My sister's one was called Jimbo, like the airplane. It was never 'Kerry'. It was always 'Kerry Dixon'.\n\nBut we had to get rid of Kerry Dixon, because he went mad. He started attacking Jimbo.\n\n8. Dion Dublin is man of many talents\n\nDion's whole family were on stage at my wedding. They can all play. His brother was an amazing DJ, did all the 1990's dance classics. It went down a storm.\n\nHe called me once and said, \"You'll never guess what. I've got a prime-time TV show.\"\n\nHe gave me the audience numbers who watched it before he gave me the show's name. I was like, \"Wow! Incredible. What is it, Match of the Day? Football Focus?\"\n\nThat's when he told me it was Homes Under the Hammer.\n\n9. He 'discovered' Oliver Bierhoff\n\nI feel I was there right back in the day with Championship Manager. I was playing that when you used the space bar on your keyboard to speed it up.\n\nI feel like I scouted Oliver Bierhoff. He was at Udinese, wasn't much of a player. Then I bought him, and he went on to some really big things.\n\nAnd that was before he went to AC Milan and before he was a German legend.\n\nI genuinely believe that I scouted Oliver Bierhoff.\n\n10. Transfer rumours aren't always entirely accurate\n\nI got sold on deadline day in 2011.\n\nI was watching the breaking news graphic on TV, and apparently someone had spotted me in a helicopter going to Stoke from London.\n\nMe and my dad were watching that in the Target Lane services on the A40, eating a Big Mac. We weren't even very far into our journey. We hadn't even done a junction.\n\nIt was sort of right - I was going to Stoke. Just in a family saloon via a McDonald's, rather than a helicopter."

Before that I was using my phone, capturing things as I travelled. Whilst the phone taught me composition, the DSLR unlocked my creativity.\"\n\nA trip to Japan in early 2016 led to the start of the Tokyo Nights series, which he began posting on social media.\n\n\u201cI got lost in the beauty of Tokyo at night,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt was like living in the cyberpunk world that Syd Mead had created in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner.\u201d The evocative, neon-lit shots soon earned him a devoted following.\n\nHe adds: \u201cMy career in games taught me art direction and how to work in a variety of styles, but photography has taken me out of my comfort zone, to see places, meet people and help build my confidence.\n\n\u201cI always try to go a little further than what I feel I\u2019m capable of \u2013 being out of my comfort zone is where I create the things I am most excited about.\u201d\n\nHis former home Dundee is currently in the spotlight thanks to the opening of the V&A\u2019s prestigious new design museum, and Wong is happy to see the city receiving international attention.\n\nHe says: \u201cThe best thing about my time in Dundee was making connections and collaborating with people across different industries who had invaluable experience in their craft. That mix of industries is what makes Dundee special and so ahead of other cities.\u201d\n\nWith an aesthetic inspired by science fiction classic Blade Runner and directors such as Gaspar Noe and Wong Kar-wai, a move into film surely can\u2019t be far away.\n\nWong says: \u201cI see myself transitioning into film and finding a way to combine that with video games.

    "text": "Image copyright Georgetown University Image caption Valentino Dixon served most of his sentence in New York's notorious Attica Correctional Facility\n\nA US convict whose talent for art caught the eye of a prison warden, ultimately leading to a review of his case, has been exonerated of murder.\n\nValentino Dixon's colour pencil drawings of golf courses were featured in Golf Digest - prompting advocates to uncover flawed evidence in the case.\n\nMr Dixon, 48, had maintained his innocence during 27 years behind bars for a shooting in Buffalo, New York.\n\nHe walked free after another man formally confessed to the murder.\n\nThe golf drawings\n\nMr Dixon had served nearly two decades at a notorious prison in upstate New York when his artistic flair attracted the notice of correctional authorities.\n\nThe warden gave him a photograph of the famed Augusta National's 12th hole in the US state of Georgia, and asked if he would draw it for him.\n\nImage copyright Golf Digest\n\n\"After 19 years in Attica Correctional Facility, the look of a golf hole spoke to me,\" said Mr Dixon.\n\n\"It seemed peaceful. I imagine playing it would be a lot like fishing.\"\n\nUsing colouring pencils, he began to create meticulous, lush drawings of various links and fairways.\n\n\"I didn't know anything about golf. I'm from the 'hood,\" he told local media.\n\nImage copyright Golf Digest\n\nHis sketches impressed the editors at Golf Digest, which featured his artwork and a profile of the prisoner in 2012.\n\n\"Maybe one day I'll get to play the game I've only imagined,\" Mr Dixon said in the article, describing how he drew landscapes he has never seen.\n\nThe magazine's coverage spurred wrongful-conviction advocates to look into the matter. Georgetown University law students championed his case.\n\nThe conviction\n\nMr Dixon was handed a minimum 38-year-to-life sentence for killing 17-year-old Torriano Jackson one night in August 1991, after an argument over a girl.\n\nHe acknowledged being at the crime scene, but said he was at a nearby shop buying beer when the gunshots rang out.\n\nMr Dixon said multiple witnesses could have testified he did not fire the gun.\n\nBut his trial lawyer did not call any of them as several had been accused of perjury.\n\nUnusually, the investigating homicide detective did not testify during the trial either.\n\nBut a more serious flaw in the case was uncovered by Georgetown University's Prisons and Justice Initiative.\n\nProsecutors had omitted to reveal to Mr Dixon's defence attorney that a gunpowder test on his client's clothes had come back negative.\n\nThe real killer\n\nPerhaps even more egregiously, another man, Lamarr Scott, admitted to local media only days after the murder that he shot Torriano Jackson.\n\nScott told a WGRZ-TV reporter: \"I don't want my friend [Mr Dixon] to take the rap for something that I did.\"\n\nImage copyright Georgetown University Image caption Georgetown University students who worked on the case greeted Mr Dixon upon his release\n\nBut he was never arrested. The victim's brother said he saw Mr Dixon open fire.\n\nAccording to the Buffalo News, prosecutors conceded that Scott had been admitting his guilt in the case for a long time.\n\n\"Mr Scott has been confessing to this crime since 12 August 1991,\" Assistant District Attorney Sara Dee told the court.\n\n\"He has confessed to this crime in excess of 10 times.\"\n\nExoneration\n\nLamarr Scott - who is currently in jail for a separate attack - finally had the chance to formally confess to the crime on Wednesday.\n\nHours later, Mr Dixon was released.\n\n\"I grabbed the gun,\" Scott, now 46, told the courtroom in Erie County, New York.\n\n\"I pulled the trigger and all the bullets came out. Unfortunately, Torriano ended up dying.\"\n\nIt was Erie County District Attorney John Flynn - in the job less than a year - who ordered a review of the case.\n\nBut despite Mr Dixon's exoneration, prosecutors say he did provide the murder weapon, which they described as a machine gun.\n\nThey also said he was an \"up-and-coming drug dealer\" in Buffalo at the time of his arrest.\n\n\"Mr Dixon is innocent of the shooting and of the murder for what he was found guilty of, but Mr Dixon brought the gun to the fight,\" said the district attorney.\n\nWhat next for Valentino Dixon?\n\n\"It's the greatest feeling in the world,\" he said as he walked a free man from court in Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday.\n\nHe was greeted outside by his daughter, who was a baby when he was jailed.\n\nThe 27-year-old brought along her own 14-month-old twins.\n\nMr Dixon says he hopes to keep up his illustrations, and even visit a golf course in real life someday.\n\n\"With his mind and body intact, Dixon hopefully has some good years ahead,\" Golf Digest wrote on Wednesday.\n\n\"Maybe he'll even take up golf.\"\n\nYou may also like:"

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Wasps, often encountered on picnics, have a poor reputation with the public\n\nA new study reveals that wasps are largely disliked by the public, whereas bees are highly appreciated.\n\nThe researchers involved say that this view is unfair because wasps are just as ecologically useful as bees.\n\nThe scientists suggest a public relations campaign to restore the wasps' battered image.\n\nThey'd like to see the same efforts made to conserve them as there currently are with bees.\n\nThe survey of 750 people from 46 countries has been published in Ecological Entomology.\n\nDespised by picnickers, feared for their painful stings - wasps are among the least loved of insects according to the new study.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Researchers say that wasps carry out as many valuable ecological services as bees\n\nIn the survey, participants were asked to rate the insects on a scale which ran from minus five, representing a strongly negative emotion to plus five, representing a strongly positive one.\n\nThe vast majority of responses for bees were plus 3 or above, whereas it was the complete reverse for wasps, with the vast majority rating their feelings minus three or below.\n\nWhen asked to think of words associated with bees, the most popular for bees were \"honey\", \"flowers\" and \"pollination\".\n\nFor wasps the most common words that came to mind were \"sting\", \"annoying\" and \"dangerous\".\n\nHowever wasps also pollinate flowers as well as killing pests and are just as important to the environment as bees.\n\nThe problem, according to Dr Seirian Sumner, of University College London, who led the research, is that wasps have had a bad press.\n\nThe public are unaware of all the good things they do so they are regarded as nuisances rather than an important ecological asset.\n\nImage copyright schnuddel Image caption Bees have enjoyed far more attention from research scientists\n\n\"People don't realise how incredibly valuable they are,\" she told BBC News.\n\n\"Although you might think they are after your beer or jam sandwich - they are, in fact, much more interested in finding insect prey to take back to their nest to feed their lavae.\"\n\nDr Sumner also discovered that there is a lack of research into the mostly positive impact wasps have on the environment.\n\nShe analysed scientific research papers and conference presentations for bees and wasps over the last 37 years and 16 years respectively.\n\nOf 908 papers sampled, only 2.4% wasp publications were found since 1980, compared to 97.6% (886 papers) bee publications. Of the 2,543 conference abstracts on bees or wasps from the last twenty years, 81.3% were on bees.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The sting of a wasp is feared but only one percent of the creatures sting\n\nThis lack of research is stalling efforts to develop conservation strategies for wasps, whose numbers are declining because of loss of habitat and climate change according to Dr Alessandro Cini of the University of Florence, who collaborated on the study.\n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter"

She was the most beautiful woman I have ever known, inside and out... but she often struggled to see that.\"\n\nThe man recalled how his wife \"started dieting and working out extensively\" and he said one of his biggest regrets was that he had sometimes \"made her feel less than beautiful\".\n\n\"It still hurts me to think of the days and months where she was eating less in the hopes that I'd love her more,\" he wrote. \"It makes me angry at myself.\"\n\nAdmitting the mistakes he made, the widower offered some advice to the young woman:\n\n\"I think you should let [your boyfriend] know how this makes you feel. If he loves you, I think he would be horrified to realize what his words do to you. If he does not realize that, you need to feed your soul a better diet.\"\n\nMany responded to the \"beautiful post\" to say it made them reflect on how they had treated their partners.\n\nImage copyright kalayaMdsn\n\nOthers urged EndlessEnds to go easy on himself: \"Oh man, you're bringing me to tears. Please forgive yourself.\"\n\nReddit user 'nocturne' wrote: \"Your post is incredibly valuable for women whose partners disrespect them... because it helps them realize that there are people out there that care and want their partners to feel good.\"\n\nImage copyright Gorehog\n\nThe widower thanked people for their kind words, and said the interaction had been \"a really sad realization\" of how he had treated his wife.\n\n\"I was both the person who hurt her, and the one who failed in his duty to protect her.\""

    "text": "The conversation on consent\n\nThis fast became the most divisive moment of the entire Me Too movement, with people taking sides in the case of Grace and Aziz. The conversation around the night in question, and the allegations that were made about it, had spurred on a scarily heated debate. It seemed to really trigger people on both sides. For me, however I felt about this accusation, I saw it as an important opportunity to open the conversation on consent. I wanted to turn the debate into a discussion, and include people in the conversation, rather than shut them out with scolding and shame.\n\nPhoto credit: Sela Shiloni\n\nI truly believe a lot of sexual offence takes place more often out of ignorance, rather than just pure evil. There is a lot of toxic misinformation in our society, in our culture, even in our most mainstream entertainment. I think a lot of people who cross the line honestly often don\u2019t know that they are doing anything wrong. Even if it feels wrong while they are doing it, I think they don\u2019t always even know why, because so many of their portals of information tell them this behavior is normal and healthy.\n\nWe just don\u2019t talk about it. It\u2019s apparently much less awkward to just go ahead and try it, and fumble around in a tumble dryer of trial and error, than discuss it beforehand and establish a few simple guidelines. This has to change, and this is what the two documentaries \u2013 The New Age of Consent \u2013 are aiming to do: to open and change the conversation around consent.\n\nBy removing the entirely unnecessary and frankly archaic taboo around sex and intimacy, we strive to encourage people to find a vocabulary with which to comfortably discuss sex. We learn from our excellent guests about pleasure, safety, verbal and non-verbal cues in the bedroom, and how imperative communication is when doing something that, while being fun and liberating, is also quite serious and fragile.\n\nNegligence and insensitivity of any sort in the bedroom really can have lasting effects, some of which can change people\u2019s lives forever. We meet some of the survivors of sexual assault and learn about the huge implications involved in disregarding someone\u2019s sexual needs and well-being."

    "text": "N'Golo Kante drank tea and ate curry with his new friends\n\nChicken curry. A few games of Fifa. Match of the Day. It sounds like an evening with your mates - not what you would do with a World Cup winner.\n\nAnd that is exactly what a group of friends did this weekend after spotting N'Golo Kante at a local mosque.\n\nThe Chelsea midfielder, 27, missed his Eurostar train from St Pancras after his side's 4-1 win over Cardiff on Saturday.\n\nHe visited a mosque in Kings Cross after his error, where the France international met a fan who decided to pluck up the courage to invite the star round to his house.\n\nBadlur Rahman Jalil admitted \"he beat us all on Fifa\"\n\nTwitter user @abz_gooner shared his delight at spending the evening with the Chelsea star\n\nArsenal fan Badlur Rahman Jalil, 31, seized the opportunity to ask the two-time Premier League winner the cheeky question - to which Kante happily obliged.\n\n\"I went to the mosque on Saturday evening to pray and we just prayed together. It's Islamic teaching to invite guests to your house for dinner, so I asked him,\" Badlur said.\n\n\"He came with me and my brother because he was on his own and said he was only going to go home anyway.\n\n\"He was on a protein diet so we had a chicken curry. He even had a cup of tea.\n\n\"He beat us all at Fifa and then we watched Match of the Day. It was a really nice evening.\"\n\nChelsea confirmed the star \"accepted the kind invitation and was very grateful for the gesture\"\n\nTwitter user @jahrul999 received a text from Badlur telling him to come over - with curry, Fifa and Match of the Day on the evening's agenda.\n\n\"My friend's older brother saw him at the mosque and asked him why he was there,\" the 22-year-old Liverpool fan said.\n\n\"Kante told him he had missed his Eurostar to Paris. He was going over there to visit family. My mate invited him to his house and said he would be happy to feed him.\n\n\"He turned up a little while later and had a chicken curry and played Fifa. I got a text to go round so I went and we all just sat there watching Match of the Day with him.\"\n\nThe Reds fan cheekily asked Kante to join Liverpool\n\nA group of around eight to 10 friends gathered at the house, where they spent around two hours with the Premier League star.\n\n\"I'm a Liverpool fan and most of us are Arsenal fans, but Kante is more than just a footballer. As a Muslim, he is a great role model to us and an example of a good human being,\" @jahrul999 added.\n\n\"He grounds you. He is such a humble person. He doesn't think he is on another level to you.\n\n\"Footballers must get annoyed with people asking for photos all of the time, but he was more than happy to take individual photos with us all. You could tell it was a genuine smile.\"\n\nA Chelsea spokesman confirmed the story and added with a smile: \"That's typical N'Golo\"."

    "authors": [],
    "text": "1. Cloudburst\n\nA sudden, heavy, downpour that starts and ends suddenly, normally covering a small geographical area. Cloudbursts are often responsible for flash floods. The term cloudburst derived from the notion that clouds are like water balloons, releasing copious amounts of water when burst.\n\n2. Spitting\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum is this rather unpleasant term for light rain that you can only just see. We might say it\u2019s spitting when it's just started to rain, with this type of barely-there rainfall often preceding a heavier downpour.\n\n3. Picking\n\nWhere the English use spitting, the Welsh might use picking. The word comes from the Welsh word pigan meaning \u201cstarting to rain\u201d.\n\n4. Mizzle\n\nA misty drizzle. The term is commonly used in Devon and Cornwall to describe a mixture of fine drizzle and thick, saturating mist or fog. Although mizzle might seem like a clever portmanteau combining mist and drizzle, it likely derives from the Low German miseln or Dutch word for drizzle, miezelen."

    "text": "Image copyright Alexa Chung\n\nIf you're sick of hearing people shout \"Alexa!\" everywhere you go, it's probably best you steer clear of London Fashion Week.\n\nNot because the photographers and journalists are spending the weekend barking at their smart speakers, but because of a certain newcomer to this season's schedule.\n\nAppearing alongside the likes of Jasper Conran, Victoria Beckham, Burberry and Pam Hogg is former TV presenter and model Alexa Chung.\n\nShe may have been a familiar face in fashion for more than a decade, but Alexa's LFW debut this weekend comes just one year after launching her eponymous clothing brand.\n\nOf course, unleashing an entire collection of clothes you've designed as part of such a starry and prestigious line-up would understandably be a daunting prospect for anyone.\n\nBut \"imposter syndrome\", as she refers to it, is something the Alexa is no stranger to.\n\n\"It's not exclusive to fashion, I've felt it with everything I've done,\" the 34-year-old tells BBC News.\n\n\"Writing for Vogue, that's a huge imposter syndrome. Television, every day before we went live, I'd be like, 'am I equipped to do this? I don't know'.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Alexa pictured backstage at her debut London Fashion Week show on Saturday\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Models wore designs from Alexa's \"arrivals and departures\" collection\n\n\"And they're counting down in your ear and I'm like: 'Oh my god I'm a TV presenter, that's crazy.'\"\n\nFeeling inadequate or as if you're about to be \"found out\" at work is a something a surprisingly large number of us can relate to. Jobs which are high-profile or high-pressure often come with such a feeling.\n\nThe author Maya Angelou once said she feared being uncovered as a fraud despite, at that point, having a Pulitzer Prize and 11 successful books to her name.\n\nBut, Alexa reasons: \"I think it's a good thing to be aware of or to feel about yourself, because it allows you to still be open to learning, it means you're more curious about other people and how their journeys have happened.\n\n\"Also, if you're egotistical and think you definitely deserve to be doing this then maybe you won't be progressing or evolving.\"\n\nAlexa has now returned to the UK and is living in London after several years in New York.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Alexa pictured at Stella McCartney's Paris Fashion Week show last October\n\nHer first collection for LFW is themed \"arrivals and departures\", because, she explains: \"I've always been fascinated by airport dressing.\"\n\n\"What's interesting to me is there's this place where people from literally all around the world in one hallway are all expressing themselves, be it in the most casual form or whatever.\n\n\"And it's where people are the most vulnerable, because you're flying either long haul or short haul but feeling really gross, so how does one's personal style leak out of them when they're in an environment that's deeply unglamorous?\n\n\"That's quite interesting to me, because when you do spot someone that's looking really dapper in an airport you're like 'wow, total image commitment'. So we started thinking about that.\"\n\nImage copyright AlexaChung Image caption Scarves featuring Alexa's designer logo were featured in her latest LFW collection\n\nThe creative process involved Alexa looking back at figures from the 1960s and 70s - an era her own style is heavily influenced by.\n\nShe cites Bianca Jagger and Pattie Boyd as key figures - both of whom were often photographed on airplanes or in airports.\n\n\"Our starting point was looking at those glamorous images of yesteryear when flying was a more unique experience,\" Alexa explains.\n\n\"Having a romance to the idea of a journey that someone's on and also just the juxtaposition of comfort and glamour.\"\n\nSuch photos, taken at the height of the Beatles and Rolling Stones' fame, are a far cry from the accessible and mainstream budget airliners of today.\n\nLow-cost carriers such as Ryanair and Easyjet were introduced in the 1990s and put foreign holidays within financial reach of an entire generation.\n\nTheir huge success was attributed to the favourable economy at the time and deregulation within Europe allowing free movement.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Pattie Boyd photographed with then-husband George Harrison in 1966\n\nThis may be the first time Alexa's own designs are taking centre stage, but she has collaborated extensively with other fashion brands in the past - whether as a model, ambassador, designer or curator.\n\nShe says she was \"lulled into a false sense of security\", by some of the previous projects she's worked on, \"which is why I had the gumption to even start this company\".\n\n\"I was like 'it's easy', and then I started doing it myself and I was like: 'Oh, okay, there are lots of backstage elves that were really helping make that really slick and I obviously wasn't privy to the hellmare that was creating stuff.\n\n\"I think I had an essence of it and I was able to see the tip of the iceberg in terms of looking at marketing or designing swing tags or all of the nitty gritty, but I was still only going about 20% deep.\n\n\"Whereas obviously starting my own company from scratch, including securing funding and employing a CEO, and starting from that seed outwards, in a kitchen, to building a team of 30 people, there is no training for that.\"\n\nAlexa has never been short of work - or popularity - a position which, if in the same situation, many of us could get used to.\n\nWith that in mind, and given the all-consuming nature of launching a business, it raises the question of why she chose to embark on her own clothing venture at all.\n\nImage copyright AlexaChung\n\n\"The reality of getting older was, I desired a more grown-up job, basically,\" she says.\n\n\"I didn't want to live in New York and be someone that could only be responsive rather than proactive about something.\n\n\"While you're waiting for the phone to ring, it felt like a juvenile position for a woman of 30 to be in. I want to create my own projects.\""

A minister called it a \"vicious crime\".\n\nOne man was taken to hospital after eating a strawberry that held a needle.\n\nSeveral brands have been recalled, while New Zealand's biggest grocers have stopped selling Australian strawberries as a precaution.\n\nAustralian Health Minister Greg Hunt ordered the Food Safety Authority of Australia and New Zealand to investigate the scare.\n\n\"This is a very vicious crime and it's a general attack on the public,\" he said.\n\nLocal authorities are also investigating, but no suspects have been identified.\n\nCopycat fears\n\nCases of fruit tampering were first reported in Queensland last week, before spreading to New South Wales, Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory, South Australia and Tasmania.\n\nGrowers and police have suggested that some cases may be copycat incidents.\n\nImage copyright JOSHUA GANE Image caption Six of eight states and territories have been affected\n\nThe Queensland state government has offered a A$100,000 (\u00a355,000; $72,000) reward for information.\n\n\"How could any right-minded person want to put a baby or a child or anybody's health at risk by doing such a dreadful act?\" Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said on Saturday.\n\nOn Thursday, the Queensland Strawberry Growers' Association said the needles may have been placed by a \"disgruntled employee\". However, police said that it was too early to speculate.\n\nAt least six brands have been caught up in the scare: Berry Obsession, Berry Licious, Love Berry, Donnybrook Berries, Delightful Strawberries and Oasis.\n\nHealth officials have advised Australians to cut up strawberries before eating them.\n\nGrowers have expressed concerns that the scare, which has come during the peak of production, could have a negative effect on sales for an industry worth about A$130m a year.\n\nStrawberry prices have already dropped around the country, with prices in Western Australia now below the cost of production, ABC News reported over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday, New Zealand's two largest food distributors - Countdown and Foodstuffs - said they had stopped importing Australian strawberries due to the scare."

Not only is she expecting yet another card from the Queen but it is the first time she will blow out her candles as the UK's oldest living person.\n\nBorn on 16 September 1906, Grace Jones of Broadway in Worcestershire has not only experienced the reign of five monarchs and 21 prime ministers, but is older than the invention of the perm, was three when Heinz cream of tomato soup was introduced to Britain and was the grand old age of 21 when the first \"talkie\", The Jazz Singer, was released.\n\nShe has seen the outbreak and resolution of two world wars, and lived through the Russian Revolution, the sinking of the Titanic, and all three London Olympics.\n\nSo how has day-to-day life changed since Mrs Jones came into the world?\n\nWhat's in a name?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nMrs Jones is not the first Grace, nor even the first Grace Jones to hold the title of oldest person in the UK - she shares her name with a former holder of the record, who died aged 113 in 2013.\n\nIn 1906, Grace was one of the most popular names for girls - Margaret was the most popular - and remained in the top 50 until 1925. It then faded from use until the mid-1990s before peaking again in 2005.\n\nGladys, Doris, Hilda and Ethel were all in the top 20 in 1906 but they have all, at some point, all but disappeared since 1996.\n\nThe name with an equivalent pattern for boys is Jack. In 1906 the top name for boys was William, and although none of 1906's top 20 names have disappeared, Harold, Reginald and Walter are among the least popular at the moment.\n\nLust for life\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWhen she was born, Mrs Jones could have been expected to live until the age of 54. Men had the lower life expectancy of 48.\n\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, a boy born today is likely to live until he is 79 and a girl until she is 83.\n\nIn 1906 the most common cause of death was due to infections such as tuberculosis and bronchopneumonia. But the discovery of antibiotics in 1929 and their wider introduction in the early 1940s meant that dangerous illnesses became curable.\n\nBy 1945, motor vehicle crashes began to emerge as the leading cause of death in both young males and females, a figure exacerbated by the Blackout during World War Two, when vehicles drove in total darkness.\n\nThe proportion of motor vehicle deaths dropped in 1985, which could have been down to the introduction of compulsory seat belts two years earlier.\n\nNow, the most common causes of death are cancer and heart-related disease.\n\nFood for thought\n\nImage copyright Grace Jones Image caption Mrs Jones, pictured in her mid-20s, says her favourite meal is roast beef\n\nMrs Jones was born in Liverpool. A 1909 study now held at the British Library shows a typical daily menu - breakfast, dinner, tea, supper - for an ordinary family in the city.\n\nBreakfast would consist of bread, margarine and fish; Sunday lunch would be rabbit, potatoes, vegetables and rice pudding, and the meal for the rest of the week would decrease as the rabbit was used up in stews or soups until Saturday, when only potatoes remained.\n\nTea would be bread, margarine, marmalade and a cup of tea, while supper (if eaten) would be either bread or porridge with milk.\n\nBy the 1920s, tinned food was growing in availability; the 1930s saw a \"milk for schools\" scheme, and the 1940s cook had to deal with rationing. The 1940s and 70s saw a surge in the popularity of curries.\n\nMrs Jones says her favourite meal was always roast beef with Yorkshire pudding and vegetables. The origins of the Sunday roast are much older than the centenarian, and could date as far back as medieval times.\n\nImage copyright British Library\n\nThat's entertainment\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nMusic hall, one of the most popular forms of entertainment, hit a crisis in January 1907 when Mrs Jones was about four months old.\n\nIt arose from the fact that many performers were annoyed at exclusivity clauses employed by theatres. The clause meant artists could not appear at multiple venues on the same day, which limited the amount of money they could earn.\n\nArtists, musicians and stagehands went on strike across the country, organised by the Variety Artistes' Federation, which had been formed in 1906.\n\nMrs Jones's daughter Deidre, now 80, became a singer on cruise ships and theatres. Mrs Jones says she enjoyed watching the performances, which featured artists such as Cheerful Charlie Chester, David Whitfield, Ken Platt and duo Pearl Carr and Teddy Johnson.\n\nShe also enjoyed watching the 1950s ballroom TV programme Come Dancing - and now says her favourite entertainment is Strictly Come Dancing.\n\nFashion\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nMrs Jones was a milliner before she married her husband Leonard in 1933. Mr Jones - who died in 1985 - told her to give up work, which she did, but she says she continued to enjoy dressing stylishly and still gets her hair done weekly at the retirement home where she lives. She says she has kept five wardrobes full of clothes.\n\nAccording to archives at the V&A Museum, when Mrs Jones was born, middle and upper-class women would wear corsets, puffed frilly blouses and broad-brim hats. Ladies would wear their hair in a centre parting and - in a trend that has come full circle - would sometimes incorporate false hair to create a more impressive hairline.\n\nMen wore three-piece suits with bowler or cloth caps. Jackets were narrow with small, high lapels. Some men wore their collars turned down, with rounded edges and modern knotted ties, and beards tended to be reserved for mainly older men, while most young men sported neat moustaches and short hair.\n\nAdvertising space\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe most popular adverts of all time - as voted by the British public - include Cadbury's gorilla playing the drums, Martians enjoying some Smash, and JR Hartley tracking down a copy of Fly Fishing via the Yellow Pages.\n\nA judgemental question about one's taste in vinegar did not make the top 10, but in 1906 \"the girl in the white cap\" urged the modern British housewife always to ask the grocer for Heinz.\n\nThose who failed to do so ran the risk of giving their family \"a harsh, crude product possibly more or less adulterated and dangerous\".\n\nMrs Jones, whose daughter is organising a party to mark her 112th birthday, knows exactly how the day will end.\n\n\"I always have a little drop of whisky and water in bed at night,\" she says. \"Just a drop, and that's all, but I never miss it.\""

These \"super blooms\" occur in deserts and arid landscapes around the world, but few are as consistent or diverse as South Africa's flower season.\n\nTypically lasting for just a few weeks between late July and late September, the flowers are annuals and will die with the first hot winds of the year, their seeds then lying dormant through the baking heat of summer until next year's rains.\n\nPhotographer Tommy Trenchard captured this natural phenomenon.\n\n\"It's was a pretty surreal sight\" said Trenchard, who stumbled across the flowers by chance on an anniversary getaway with his wife in South Africa's Biedouw Valley.\n\n\"And the short-lived, ephemeral nature of this natural display just makes it all the more special.

    "text": "Image copyright Jacob Ammentorp Lund Image caption Thrills, spills and kidney stone removal: Everything you could wish for from a roller-coaster ride\n\nRiding on some types of roller-coaster is an effective way of removing kidney stones.\n\nThis is the conclusion of research that has won this year's Ig Nobel Prize for Medicine.\n\nThe US researchers who carried out the work recommend that those afflicted with the condition should regularly use the theme park attractions.\n\nThe Ig Nobels are spoof prizes that are published in the Annals of Improbable Research.\n\nMany of the topics recognised in the awards actually have a serious point to them.\n\nThe inspiration behind the roller-coaster research began several years ago when one of Prof David Wartinger's patients at Michigan State University's College of Osteopathic Medicine returned from a holiday trip to Walt Disney World in Florida.\n\nThe patient reported that one of his kidney stones became dislodged after a ride on the Big Thunder Mountain ride.\n\nImage copyright David Wartinger Image caption Rides that constantly rattle passengers are more effective in dislodging stones than ones that involve big drops\n\nWondering whether it was caused by the ride or a coincidence, the patient went on the ride several more times and each time a stone popped out.\n\nIntrigued by the story, Prof Wartinger built a silicone model of his patient's renal system, including artificial kidney stones, and took it with him on numerous rides.\n\nHe discovered that Big Thunder Mountain was indeed effective - more so than the scarier rides such as Space Mountain or Rock 'n' Roller Coaster which involve prolonged drops.\n\nProf Wartinger concluded that this was because Big Thunder Mountain involves more up and down and side to side movements that \"rattle\" the rider.\n\nThe Medicine Prize is one of 10 Ig Nobels awarded each year for amusing and mind-bending science. They are all genuine studies and nearly all have been published in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nAt the awards ceremony, held at Harvard University in Cambridge, US, each winner has 60 seconds to deliver an acceptance speech. The time limit is strictly enforced by an eight-year-girl who says \"please stop I'm bored\" several times until the speaker finishes.\n\nMedical Education: Scientists are sometimes rudely described as being \"up their own backsides\" if they are thought to be too obsessed with their research.\n\nHowever, this is literally the case with a Japanese researcher, Dr Akira Horiuchi, who won the Medical Education Prize for devising a \"self-colonoscopy\" technique using a small endoscope\n\nImage copyright Akira Horiuchi Image caption From the '\"Anals\" of Improbable Research. Dr Akira Horiuchi demonstrating the ease of use of his self-colonoscopy device.\n\n\"This trial may be funny, but I inserted an endoscope into my colon for a serious purpose,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"People, especially in Japan, are afraid of colonoscopy and they do not want to undergo colonoscopy. So the number of people who die from colorectal cancer is increasing. I do this research to make colonoscopy easier and more comfortable, so fewer people will die\".\n\nLiterature: This year's Literature Prize was for an investigation into instruction manuals that come with consumer products. The Investigation was called, Life Is Too Short to RTFM: How Users Relate to Documentation and Excess Features.\n\n\"RTFM\" is an acronym for \"read the field manual\", though, according to the researchers, it has gained a new meaning by consumers who are often frustrated by the complexity of operation of their product.\n\nNutrition: A British researcher won the Nutrition Prize for calculating that pound per pound, it is not worth eating human flesh compared with other types of meat. This was to analyse the eating practices of early humans, rather than to inform present-day dietary choices.\n\nEconomics: For economics, the winner was research investigating whether it is effective for employees to use voodoo dolls to retaliate against bullying bosses. This study showed that taking it out on dolls does alleviate negative feelings, but suggested in the long run that it was better to deal with the underlying issue.\n\nChemistry: The winner of the Ig Nobel Chemistry Prize went to research that settled the issue of whether human saliva is a good cleaning agent for dirty surfaces. It is - especially for fragile, painted areas on ceramics, and on gold leaf.\n\nBiology: A Swedish team won the biology Ig Nobel for demonstrating that wine experts can reliably identify, by smell, the presence of a fly in a glass of wine - possibly sparking a new genre of jokes involving sommeliers.\n\nPeace: Last but not least, the Ig Nobel Peace Prize went to a Spanish group that aimed to find ways of reducing road rage, in a paper titled, Shouting and Cursing While Driving: Frequency, Reasons, Perceived Risk and Punishment. The team's solution is to try to reduce stress on the road - a task as sizable as reducing conflict in the Middle East.\n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter\n\nYou may also like:\n\nMark Wahlberg reveals gruelling regimen\n\nUS boy impaled on meat skewer will recover\n\nArt students made to look black in photo"

    ],
    "text": "Jumping into the sea in winter is the most alive and present I ever feel. I get in fast - a dangerous approach if you're a beginner - when the cold shock response provokes an uncontrollable urge to inhale.\n\nUnderwater, I feel an intense mixture of burning pain and, even after doing this for years, a little panic. But it's the only time the anxious negative chatter in my head is truly silenced.\n\nAfter two minutes, as my skin reaches the same temperature as the water, I start to feel comfortable and my breathing slows. After even a brief swim, I feel elated for hours and calm for days.\n\nLike many other people who swim in cold water regularly, I love it, but I also believe it has mental health benefits.\n\nAnd the first case report on cold water swimming published in British Medical Journal Case Reports shows that it may be an effective treatment for depression.\n\nDiving in\n\nThe Doctor Who Gave Up Drugs, a series broadcast on BBC One in 2016, which I developed and presented, followed Sarah, a 24-year-old who had been taking antidepressants since the age of 17.\n\nHer symptoms had started earlier in her teens. When we met, she was desperate to stop her antidepressants, saying they put her in a \"chemical fog\".\n\nShe loved swimming and, because of my own experience, I approached Prof Mike Tipton and Dr Heather Massey, both scientists at the extreme environments laboratory at Portsmouth University.\n\nI also spoke to their collaborator Dr Mark Harper, a consultant anaesthetist at Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals, to see if there was any scientific basis for trying out cold water swimming on Sarah.\n\nImage caption Sarah wanted to stop taking antidepressants, which she started at 17\n\nStress response\n\nOutdoor exercise and the companionship of fellow swimmers can improve symptoms of depression and anxiety. But the team at Portsmouth believed there might be an effect of cold water immersion itself.\n\nThere is a convincing, biologically plausible, theory about how this might work.\n\nImmersion in cold water evokes a stress response: a set of physiological and hormonal reactions that evolved millions of years ago to cope with a wide range of potential threats.\n\nAnimal attack, jumping in cold water and sitting an exam all elicit a similar response.\n\nHeart rate, blood pressure and breathing rate all increase and stress hormones are released.\n\nBut, if you immerse yourself only a few times in water of 15C or less, this stress response is reduced.\n\nHowever, it is not only the stress response to cold water that reduces with repeated immersions.\n\nCold water swimming - how to do it safely\n\nApproach it with the same caution you would exercise - if you have heart disease, start slow and warm\n\nMake sure you can swim and go with a friend who can swim\n\nStart in summer/early autumn when UK sea temperatures are 15-20\u00b0C\n\nStart shallow - a gently shelving beach, or somewhere with a ladder\n\nGo on a calm day - the initial two to three-minute period gasp when you can inhale water is the risky bit. Relax, do as little as possible and keep your head above the water for this period\n\nTime yourself for two to three minutes. Once your skin reaches the same temperature as the water you'll feel warm\n\nSix three-minute swims will have an effect on your cold shock response that will last for months. As for your mood - you'll have to be the judge until there are more studies\n\nCheck out the The Outdoor Swimming Society website for safety advice and more.\n\nProf Tipton and Dr Massey have shown that the response to the stress of exercising at altitude is also diminished.\n\nThis is called \"cross-adaptation\", where one form of stress adapts the body for another.\n\nThere is increasing evidence linking depression and anxiety with the inflammation that accompanies a chronic stress response to the physical and psychological problems of modern life.\n\nThrough cross-adaptation, cold water swimming may be able to reduce this chronic stress response together with the inflammation and mental health problems that affect so many of us.\n\nImage caption Sarah and Dr van Tulleken go cold water swimming\n\nThe theory is sound, but the evidence it works is all anecdotal, apart from this case report.\n\nCold water swimmers describe many benefits: they never get colds and never turn the heating on in winter. Many have stories of how they came to outdoor swimming in times of grief or bereavement and found comfort, even joy, in the water.\n\nThe team at Portsmouth are starting to test these stories. A preliminary study supports the claims made about colds and further reports are being prepared about patients with a range of conditions.\n\n'Life is good'\n\nSince 2006, prescriptions of antidepressants have more than doubled and, while patients may take these drugs for many years, there is debate about their effectiveness.\n\nNew approaches which attempt to tackle the multiple causes of depression are badly needed.\n\nDr Mark Harper is cautiously optimistic. He says: \"Our observations so far support the hypothesis that cold water swimming may have a range of benefits.\"\n\nMore than two years later, Sarah is still swimming and off all medication.\n\n\"Life is good. I still have counselling but the swimming is something I'll never turn my back on,\" she says.\n\n\"It helped me so much in a time of need.\"\n\nDo not stop antidepressants or any other medication without discussion with your prescriber first."

Since the opinions of the artists are also important, this should be deliberately decided through the process of collecting opinions.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What do non-Koreans love about K-pop?\n\nHyunA has had a successful solo career and E'Dawn is also known as a member of boy band Pentagon. The pair formed Triple H as a side project with fellow Pentagon singer Hui.\n\nThe relationship was revealed by HyunA, confirmed in a post on Instagram, telling her followers she \"wanted to stay honest\".\n\nThe change comes after many on social media specifically pointed to the fact HyunA has worked for Cube Entertainment for far longer than the CEO.\n\nYou may also like:\n\nThe decision to sack the pair was heavily criticised. Some fans defended HyunA by asking how her work for Cube Entertainment could be ignored simply because she was in a relationship.\n\nOthers came to the defence of E'Dawn, with fans referencing his struggle to land a contract with the label on TV show Pentagon Maker - a reality talent show where people competed to be part of the band.\n\nThose not familiar with K-Pop might recognise HyunA from her appearance in the music video for Psy's crossover hit Gangnam Style, where she can be seen dancing on an underground train before joining Psy in a larger routine.\n\nThe success of the video led the pair to release a new version of Gangnam Style sung as a duet, which has been viewed over 720 million times on YouTube."

But what's the problem, and is it really anyone's business how passengers spend their travel time?\n\nNo-one likes being stuck on the train next to the man shouting into his mobile or opposite the woman eating raw fish.\n\nBut is applying a full face of slap between Peterborough and London King's Cross really on a par?\n\nThe answer, for many, is yes. Make-uppers featured heavily in response to reader submissions of passenger pet peeves.\n\nMichael, 59, said he was so offended by the sight he had moved carriages.\n\n\"I think once or twice I just stared at the person thinking that they would eventually notice and feel embarrassed. That never happened,\" he said.\n\n\"It's something for someone's private space - their bedroom or bathroom. So to find myself sitting on a train and then suddenly inside someone's bathroom is very unwelcome.\"\n\nImage copyright Matt Holyoak/Pixiwoo Image caption Pixiwoo's Nic Chapman, left, says applying make-up in private is an outdated concept\n\nFor 60-year-old Gerard, a woman applying make-up in public is as bad-mannered as a man combing his hair in public.\n\n\"Why can they not get up 10 minutes earlier and do [their make-up] at home?\" he asked.\n\n\"There seems to be something so totally 'in your face' about females who insist on their dubious 'rights' in this matter.\"\n\nImage copyright Rachel Moss Image caption Beauty salon owner Rachel Moss said it was not acceptable for men to judge women's make-up routines\n\nRachel Moss, owner of Shrewsbury beauty salon The Glam Studio, said men have no right to tell women what they can and can't do on the train.\n\n\"What difference does it make to their journey?\" the 37-year-old asked.\n\n\"I can't imagine it's invading their personal space unless they have the entire contents of Boots' make-up counter on the table.\n\n\"Make-up for most women is to make them feel good, to look good and being judged by men for this really isn't acceptable in 2018.\n\n\"Even men like to wear make-up these days so maybe they are just jealous and would like some tips.\"\n\nOther things to read on your travels\n\nCreative commuters who enjoy the ride\n\nEmails on commute 'should count as work'\n\nIs it OK to paint your nails on a train?\n\nMore to the point, asks PhD student Rebecca Hall, why is it anyone else's business where a woman chooses to put on her eyeliner?\n\n\"The implication is that women should emerge from their homes with a complete face of make-up or else face complaints from members of the public,\" said the 26-year-old.\n\n\"What message does it send to young girls? That they are expected to be 'on show' at all times and not once can they let the mask slip?\n\n\"Societal pressures are not enabling women to be free, they are confining them... to the privacy of their bathrooms.\"\n\nImage copyright Rebecca Hall Image caption Rebecca Hall said complaining about women doing their make-up in public was not a good message to send to youngsters\n\nThe idea that make-up is a secret and should be applied in private is an outdated concept, says professional make-up artist Nic Chapman and one half of beauty brand, Pixiwoo.\n\n\"Make-up videos are the most viewed videos on YouTube - people want to watch it.\n\n\"I actually really enjoy watching other people do their make-up on the train.\n\n\"I think, 'good on you'. We are not ashamed of wearing make up. Times have changed.\"\n\nNot for Simon Dessain, 61, who said: \"Grooming is just not a suitable activity for a train, any more than leaky earphones, or bodily noises... make-up just falls into the same category of behaviour.\"\n\nSarah Pennells, founder of the Savvy Woman money website, said eating \"stinky food or leaving rubbish has an impact on other people in the way doing your make up doesn't\".\n\nBut this represents a grey area for some - the issue is not one of physicality, but hygiene, says self-confessed \"germaphobe\", Dilruba Khanom.\n\n\"I do admire a woman's confidence to not give two hoots and slap on the face [in public] - even if people like me shudder,\" she says.\n\n\"But can you imagine how dirty the Underground is with people's skin particles floating around?\n\n\"Then you get out your make-up brush or even worse, use your fingers that you have just touched the tube handle bar with to apply make up.\"\n\nImage copyright Sarah Wadsworth Image caption Sarah Wadsworth said she picks up tips on applying make-up by watching other commuters\n\nApplying make-up was cited by many as the perfect use of the otherwise wasted minutes spent getting from A to B.\n\nFor Sarah Wadsworth, the morning train ride was \"a little gift of time\" between caring for her terminally ill mother, studying for a degree and volunteering as a youth worker.\n\n\"Why wouldn't you grab an extra 20 minutes in bed or hang the washing out to dry before leaving the house, when you know you can do your make-up on the train without causing injury to people around you?\"\n\nFor Ms Chapman, it's a matter of using your time wisely, regardless of activity.\n\n\"My journey into London is two hours - I'm not going to get up put my make-up on, and not spend that time with my kids - I'm going to do my make-up on the train.\n\n\"It's totally acceptable, how you choose to spend your journey is your choice. I'm all for it and I'd like to see more of it.\""

We often laugh because we have expectations of behaviour, which a comic character can confirm or confound for our delight. If there are already clues in the syllables of a character\u2019s name - are they grand or humble, soft or spiky - we know them a little from the moment we meet them. You don\u2019t need to see a picture of Augustus Gloop to know which one\u2019s the greedy kid in the chocolate factory.\n\nWhere the listener or reader expects a name, the brain pauses, and you can slide whatever you like into that gap.\n\nWe keep notebooks of happy combinations of sounds we hear or see around us, in case they can be used for names. Sometimes smashing a famous first name into a similarly unmistakable surname seems to get good results (Busta Nimoy, Sugar Ray Wonka, Sigourney Beefheart, Jabba De Botton). Surnames made of words too modern to have evolved into surnames have a natural preposterousness (\u2018Dame Annabel Googlewhack\u2019) and flat or mundane words can be rendered hilarious by turning them unexpectedly into names - think of Father Ted\u2019s immortal lothario milkman Pat Mustard. In the 17th Century, there was a fad for naming children after a random word from the Bible, hence Accepted Frewen, president of Magdalen College, who had a brother called Thankful. Venerable Mayflower pilgrim William Brewster ended up with children called Patience, Fear, Love and - best of all - Wrestling.\n\nIn Agendum, we have free rein to name our reporters whatever we like (puns, silly sounds, Dr Seuss-ish gibberish) because they have one job to do - present a news item. The audience knows what to expect, and the name can\u2019t dent that. But when we get to the partly improvised studio debates, it\u2019s helpful to let the audience know who\u2019s on what side of the argument. Choosing the right daft name can help reveal class, regional background, upbringing, attitude. An appearance-fee controversialist called \u2018Yap Claven\u2019 is already annoying before he\u2019s opened his mouth."

    "authors": [
      "Dr Michael Mosley",
      "Trust Me I'M A Doctor"
    ],
    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Red meat, green veg, nuts and seeds are all good dietary sources of iron\n\nDo you often feel tired, short of breath or can you feel you heart beating away inside your chest? Have your friends commented that you look unusually pale?\n\nIf so, you may have iron-deficiency anaemia, the world's most common nutritional disorder.\n\nIn the UK, it is particularly common among young women.\n\nAn analysis by the government's Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) on iron and health in 2011 indicated 21% of women aged between 19 and 34 had below recommended levels of ferritin (how iron is stored in the body).\n\nI recently suggested to a friend with these symptoms that she might want to get herself checked out by her GP. A blood test revealed she was so anaemic it was surprising she could still walk upstairs. A few iron tablets sorted her out.\n\nIt's worth adding that you should talk to your GP if you're considering taking them - you might not need them and your symptoms could be caused by something else.\n\nWhere can you get your iron from?\n\nOur bodies can't produce iron, so you have to get it in your diet - whether through foods that naturally contain it or those that have been fortified with iron, such as white bread and breakfast cereal.\n\nThe problem is that not all of that iron is in a form you can actually absorb.\n\nImage copyright Glenn Dearing\n\nHow to get the most iron from your food\n\nEat leafy green veg raw or steamed\n\nBut do lightly boil your spinach\n\nEat or drink something containing vitamin C with your meal\n\nFermented breads are best\n\nTrust Me I'm a Doctor asked nutrition scientist Prof Paul Sharp, from King's College London, to find the foods you should be eating to boost iron levels naturally.\n\nRed meat is particularly rich in the sort of iron bodies find easy to absorb but these days many people are either cutting back on their red-meat consumption or cutting it out altogether.\n\nAnd there are good sources of iron in dark-green leafy vegetables, such as kale and spinach, and pulses, such as peas and lentils. The problem is you don't absorb as much iron from plant sources as you do from red meat.\n\nThen, there is the iron you can get from fortified bread and breakfast cereals, though again it is not always in a very absorbable form.\n\nTo demonstrate this, a neat party trick is to grind up the cereal, add some warm water and you can actually use a magnet to draw the iron filings out of the mush.\n\nWait for your coffee...\n\nHow you prepare your food and what you drink with it can also change how much iron you absorb.\n\nTo demonstrate this, Prof Sharp carried out some experiments to mimic human digestion.\n\nThe tests mimicked the effect of the enzymes involved in digesting food and the chemical reaction that occurs in human gut cells to show how much iron would be absorbed.\n\nTake the test: Could eating more iron stop you feeling tired?\n\nProf Sharp showed that if you drink orange juice with your fortified breakfast cereal you absorb much more iron than when eating the cereal on its own - because orange juice contains vitamin C, which makes it easier to absorb iron from food.\n\nBut, disappointingly, if you drink coffee with your morning bowl of cereal, then that will mean you absorb significantly less iron.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Raw cabbage anyone?\n\nWhy? Well, according to Prof Sharp, it's because coffee is full of chemicals called polyphenols that are very efficient at binding to the iron and making that iron less soluble.\n\nSo, if a fortified cereal is your breakfast of choice, then having a small glass of orange juice or an orange will help increase your iron uptake. You might also want to consider postponing your morning coffee until at least 30 minutes after you've eaten.\n\nBut what if you prefer getting your iron from more natural sources? Raw cabbage is a good source of available iron but we found that steaming it lessened the amount of available iron while boiling reduced it even further.\n\nThat's because, like oranges, cabbage is rich in vitamin C - and when you boil it, the vitamin C is released into the cooking water.\n\nSo, if you want to get the maximum nutrients from your cabbage, eat it raw (an acquired taste) or steam it.\n\nThe same is true of other veggies that contain both iron and vitamin C, such as kale, broccoli, cauliflower and watercress.\n\nBut, strangely enough, spinach is completely different. We found that when we boiled the spinach, it actually released 55% more \"bioavailable\" iron than when eaten raw.\n\nProf Sharp says: \"Spinach has compounds, called oxalates, and they basically trap the iron.\n\n\"When we cook spinach, the oxalate is released into the cooking water, and therefore the iron that remains will be more available for absorption.\"\n\nFinally, what about the bread?\n\nWe found the best bread for delivering iron was sourdough bread. That's because wheat contains a chemical called phytic acid that slows down iron absorption by the body.\n\nWhen sourdough bread is made, the fermentation process breaks down the phytic acid so the iron that remains is more available for absorption.\n\nThere are more diet tips on the Trust Me website.\n\nTrust Me I'm a Doctor continues on BBC Two on Wednesday, September 12, at 20:00."

    "text": "A mother who was forced to stand while breastfeeding on a crowded train, has urged people to show \"common courtesy\". But often it's not selfishness that stops us from making a kind gesture, it's a fear of the consequences.\n\nWe've all been on a crowded bus, a rush-hour train or Tube carriage with people packed like sardines - when someone gets on and looks around for a seat.\n\nMaybe you haven't noticed them - headphones clamped to your ears, attention gripped by a podcast. Or perhaps your eyes are fixed to your phone, your head absorbed in a mind-numbing game.\n\nMaybe you haven't noticed. Or just maybe, you've pretended not to notice. That, says mother Kate Hitchens, was the reason she was forced to stand on a busy train while breastfeeding her baby.\n\nThere are plenty of other examples of people needing seats and passengers refusing to move.\n\nSelfishness and inattention play a part, says Dr Oliver Scott Curry, an expert in human behaviour, based at the University of Oxford. But, in some cases so does buck-passing.\n\n\"Everyone can be waiting for someone else to do it, thinking 'why should it be me? I'm exhausted'.\n\n\"They're just passing the buck.\"\n\nAlmost everyone has heard of someone graciously offering a seat to a \"pregnant\" woman, only to be rebuked for their insensitivity. The woman in question had actually just enjoyed a big lunch and would be perfectly fine standing, thanks very much.\n\n\"There's a fear of getting it wrong, of seeming patronising or thinking someone is a charity case. It doesn't hurt for the person needing help to ask for it.\"\n\nAnd yet, just when it seems like humanity is doomed by self-interest, Dr Curry has observed a encouraging flipside - \"competitive helping\". This, he says, is where passengers almost fall over themselves to give up their seat to prove they're the most chivalrous.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mary Killen says society is \"increasingly selfish\"\n\nGogglebox star and social etiquette expert Mary Killen can remember a time when it was \"the custom that men always made their seat available to women and older people\".\n\n\"But now I think they've been frightened by feminists biting their heads off.\"\n\nMs Killen, who writes an advice column for The Spectator magazine, says denial among seated passengers is not a reasonable excuse.\n\n\"It's usually clear when someone needs a seat as they are either looking for [one] or trying to make eye contact. People should offer.\"\n\nWhat about the risk of social stigma at offering your hard-earned pew to someone who isn't in need.\n\n\"It's worth getting your head snapped off, because these little acts of recognition of other humans are of such value.\"\n\nOf Kate Hitchens' experience, Ms Killen says simply that \"someone should have given this lady a seat. It's extraordinary no one did, unless they were all zombified by their mobiles\".\n\n\"I also think we're becoming increasingly selfish as a society.\"\n\nImage copyright Rebecca Willcox Image caption Rebecca Willcox says some people look at her and decide she doesn't need a seat\n\nRebecca Willcox, who has secondary breast cancer, has written about her experience of interacting with strangers who cannot see she's unwell.\n\n\"From your perspective, riding a few stops without a seat isn't a great inconvenience, but for me it can mean a period of constant bangs and painful jolts to my back,\" she wrote in an article for Breast Cancer Care.\n\nSpeaking to BBC News, Mrs Willcox says she always asks for a seat as she doesn't expect people to look around and notice her badge announcing she needs to sit down.\n\n\"Only once has someone leapt up without me asking.\"\n\nBut when she has asked, \"every single time, someone has offered me a seat\" although she has detected \"grumbles.\"\n\n'Awkward situation'\n\nMrs Willcox says one woman didn't think there was anything wrong with her while a man seated on a busy platform gawped at her stomach, to see if she was pregnant, before giving up his privileged place.\n\n\"I've also had an entire carriage stand up, and it's almost embarrassing to have to choose who to turf out.\n\n\"Another time, someone at the opposite end stood up - other people had clearly looked at me and thought 'no'. I then had the awkward situation of having to shuffle past them.\n\n\"Looking at me, you wouldn't know there was anything wrong. But I'm on aggressive chemotherapy and need to sit down as I'm nauseous most of the time.\n\n\"It makes me a bit sad that people have looked at me and decided for themselves I don't need a seat. I almost want to tell them: 'You have no idea how difficult it is, living with cancer and chemotherapy side effects'.\"\n\nAdam Partridge from etiquette experts Debrett's offers the following advice: \"If you see someone that looks as if they are uncomfortable and would appreciate a seat, then it is good manners to offer yours.\"\n\nIt is better to ask and be rejected than not ask at all, he advises, and that \"there's a responsibility on both sides to refrain from taking offence\".\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption More than a million baby on board badges have been requested\n\nSo what can transport companies do?\n\nDr Curry says he wants others to follow the example of Transport for London, which initiated the \"baby on board\" badge scheme. It's also now launched a badge for those with other, less obvious, reasons they need to take the weight off their feet.\n\nThe \"Please offer me a seat\" badge has been issued 81,000 times, with the scheme adopted by Greater Anglia Trains and the New York Transit Authority.\n\nAnd over the summer it also backed the Look Up campaign started by Corry Shaw, who uses the Please Offer Me a Seat badge, but found often people just avoided eye contact, or didn't notice her at all.\n\nMs Shaw, who has a spine disorder, said it \"makes her sad\" that some people are embarrassed or scared of causing offence.\n\n\"If you are unsure about offering in case you cause offence you don't need to verbally offer,\" she wrote, \"just stand and if the person needs the seat believe me they will jump right in it (or sort of wobble into it if it's me).\""

Their offerings ranged from courses in theology to the \"scientific means\" of magic.\n\nThe curriculum for the \"Potterverse\" law course includes some of the following topics:"
