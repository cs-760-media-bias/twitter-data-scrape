    "text": "Beginning with Dee Dee (Patricia Arquette) and Gypsy\u2019s (Joey King) arrival in Springfield, Missouri, The Act tells a story of manipulation and claustrophobia. Having been left homeless by Hurricane Katrina, they now settle into a Candyland pink house built for them by Habitat for Humanity. Dee Dee would also use the story of the hurricane to perpetuate her fraud, claiming that Gypsy\u2019s medical records had been lost in the floods. In Arquette\u2019s performance, Dee Dee is a masterful and resourceful storyteller, who can repurpose any scrap of personal history for her own ends.\n\nWhen the local press arrives to interview Dee Dee, it\u2019s clear something is amiss. During the interview, Dee Dee, dominates the conversation and is quick to speak for her daughter. And when the reporter asks Gypsy if she is excited to make new friends, a telling squeeze from her mother\u2019s hand\u2014they are always holding hands\u2014communicates to Gypsy her expectation: We have a script; stick to it. \u201cWell, my mom is already my best friend,\u201d Gypsy pipes up, sweetly, but with the practiced cadence of performance. King is especially adept at insinuating her character\u2019s low simmering uneasiness, whether due to her mother\u2019s pressure or the baffling experience of existing in her carefully-managed body. She remembers her mother once giving her a miniature house as a present, and promising her they would one day live in a house like that. With this pink house, now they do.\n\nYet Gypsy is not happy, something The Act reveals almost immediately. Dean has said she was most interested in depicting \u201cthat girl getting up at night and what she does in the dark.\u201d And in fact, these are the scenes most crucial\u2014and most heartbreaking\u2014to the show, as we see a young woman struggling under the most deranged and oppressive circumstances. Puberty baffles Gypsy, because she has never been told to expect or to accept these intimate evolutions. She has been ordered to trust her mother when it comes to her health and her body.\n\nWhen certain urges and questions arise, Dee Dee unceremoniously waves them away, emphasizing on Gypsy\u2019s \u201ceighteenth birthday\u201d\u2014by now she is actually in her twenties\u2014that she will never be like other girls her age, but will instead remain her mother\u2019s \u201clittle baby.\u201d The first time we see Gypsy use a computer, she sneaks a few moments on her mother\u2019s laptop while she is outside. Running a search for \u201cbest friends,\u201d her lonely eyes tarry on stock photos of comely young women bathed in sunlight, taking selfies, laughing, and embracing: cheesy stuff, if you\u2019re acquainted with the realities of companionship, but Gypsy is not. These photos, for her, belong to a fairy tale, a story that undermines the one Dee Dee has always told\u2014that her mother is \u201calready\u201d her best friend, and, as such, other relationships are superfluous. She then googles \u201cboyfriend kiss,\u201d which yields more stock photos and signals to us that Gypsy\u2019s sexuality is burgeoning, despite her mother\u2019s attempts to squash it.\n\nDee Dee takes palpable, maniacal solace in her daughter\u2019s shattered will, relishing her crises as opportunities to perform a fantasy of motherhood.\n\nAt one point, Dee Dee covers the windows with translucent contact paper, to conceal the goings-on of the house. Her mistake is to think the threat to the life she has constructed will come from outside. What she can\u2019t prevent is her daughter\u2019s desire to pull away from her, especially as she recognizes the extent to which Dee Dee has lied about her supposedly frail health. Gypsy\u2019s teeth, long neglected, and rotting, are eventually removed at Dee Dee\u2019s instruction\u2014this is convenient, since age can be discerned through dental markings\u2014and Gypsy, who only realizes what is happening just before she is put under anesthesia, is left bruised, gummy, and utterly dispirited. As she sobs quietly in the bath, her bowed head shaven\u2014also at her mother\u2019s insistence\u2014Dee Dee takes palpable, maniacal solace in her daughter\u2019s shattered will, relishing her crises as opportunities to perform a fantasy of motherhood."

    "text": "Trump and the establishment are one in assuming that the United States must maintain global military dominance, regardless of circumstances, forever. It is long past time to question this assumption, and today only the rising left possesses the dynamism and independence to do so. In order to stand for peace, systematically not episodically, the left should oppose armed supremacy as a perpetual goal of America\u2019s foreign policy. For permanent armed supremacy produces permanent armed conflict. And its burdens are mounting.\n\nWolfowitz and his Pentagon colleagues originally justified their focus on primacy by claiming that it would bring peace. In a draft of their report, called the Defense Planning Guidance, they argued that the United States should seek a preeminence so overwhelming as to prevent any potential rival from even \u201caspiring to a larger regional or global role.\u201d After a public outcry, the final language was softened. But at least policymakers back then felt some compunction to demonstrate that Pax Americana would live up to its name.\n\nDecades later, the opposite has transpired. America spends more on defense than the next seven countries combined, with roughly 800 bases ringing the globe, yet its might has not prevented China from rising nor Russia from asserting itself, and may have antagonized both. Instead of cowing others into peace, primacy has plunged America into war. It has forced the United States to resist any significant retraction of its military power, lest it lose influence relative to anyone else. The endless wars are endless because the United States has appointed itself the world\u2019s \u201cindispensable nation,\u201d in Secretary of State Madeleine Albright\u2019s formulation, responsible less for ensuring its own safety than for maintaining its material and moral privilege to police the world. The costs include 147,000 lives in Afghanistan and $5.9 trillion for a war on terror that has stretched on since 2001, according to Brown University\u2019s Costs of War Project.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, armed primacy may well have allowed Trump to rise in the first place. To justify America\u2019s massive commitment of resources around the world, leaders have routinely claimed that foreigners are going to kill us. Trump took those inflated threats and ran with them, turning fear of deadly foreigners into the basis for his movement. That fear dates back to the second term of George W. Bush, when the xenophobia he directed toward distant \u201cIslamofascism\u201d turned inward. White supremacists rallied against immigrants at the border; nativists spread conspiracy theories that Sharia law was subverting American society. Now Trump has birthered his way to the White House, surrounded by a national security adviser and secretary of state who indulge rank Islamophobia. (John Bolton and Mike Pompeo have ties to Frank Gaffney, the author of such manifestos as \u201cThe Muslim Brotherhood in the Obama Administration.\u201d)\n\nTo be sure, many advocates of American primacy did not wish for this to happen. But it has happened. We face a world beset by war and awash in nationalism and nativism\u2014our own included. And as other powers rise, the costs of pursuing primacy will rise with them."

    "text": "For nearly two years, Democrats desperately hoped that Robert Mueller would ride in on a white horse and save the country from Donald Trump\u2019s corrupt presidency. But three days after the special counsel submitted his report to the Department of Justice, one thing is clear: The Russia investigation no longer poses a mortal threat to this presidency. Trump\u2019s future is now in the hands of a divided, hyper-partisan Congress that agrees on almost nothing.\n\nDejected Democrats may be tempted to keep fighting the administration over the Trump campaign\u2019s connections to Russia and the question of whether he obstructed justice. They are expected to increase pressure on Attorney General William Barr to release not only Mueller\u2019s full report, but all of the documents that informed it, and may even try to assume the mantle of the now-concluded Russia investigation. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between compelling evidence of collusion and whether the special counsel concludes that he can prove beyond a reasonable doubt the criminal charge of conspiracy,\u201d Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said on Sunday.\n\nIt\u2019s time for Democrats to quit their Russia obsession. Prolonging this investigation would be a grave political mistake and distract from more pressing\u2014and more politically potent\u2014inquiries into the president and his administration. It risks becoming a fool\u2019s errand on par with the Republicans\u2019 Benghazi boondoggle.\n\n\n\nThis comparison is likely to upset some on the political left, who would rightly contend that there are important differences between the Russia and Benghazi investigations. The latter was a largely manufactured scandal, an attempt to soil Barack Obama\u2019s relatively clean administration and rile up the Republican base; it ultimately morphed into a genuine witch hunt aimed at discrediting Hillary Clinton before her presidential campaign got off the ground. This is in marked contrast to Mueller\u2019s dutiful, apolitical investigation, which has produced 37 indictments and resulted in the conviction of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and his former campaign chairman, as well as a host of other figures with intimate connections to the president.\n\n"

    "text": "As Chinese President Xi Jinping concludes his first foreign trip of 2019, he can congratulate himself on at least one thing: masterfully making use of the daylight between Brussels and Washington when it comes to China policy. While the Trump administration pursues its ongoing trade war, it has failed to convince European countries to banish Huawei\u2019s equipment from their 5G infrastructures, or to resist China\u2019s international infrastructure development strategy known as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), designed to build pathways for trade but which also, critics say, expands Chinese influence and entraps countries in Chinese debt.\n\n\n\nXi\u2019s trip took him to Italy, Monaco, and France, a clever itinerary that allowed him to maximize cooperative opportunities, painting China as a willing economic and global governance partner for the EU, and allaying Chinese citizens\u2019 fears about being blackballed by the West.\n\nThe Italian portion of the visit focused on the BRI, Rome\u2019s endorsement being Xi\u2019s greatest win so far in 2019. Italy, a founding member of the EU, is the first G7 country to formally sign on to China\u2019s grand infrastructure project, breathing new life into the much-maligned initiative. Over the past year, Malaysia, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, among others, canceled or cut back BRI projects. The seizure of the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota and fears of so-called \u201cdebt-trap diplomacy\u201d further eroded faith in the project, with many countries questioning Beijing\u2019s promises of \u201cwin-win\u201d cooperation. But Italy is the wealthiest country to join the BRI, and Xi will be able to signal to his constituents that the project is still held in high international regard despite the aforementioned setbacks.\n\nThough many EU countries, particularly Germany and France, have been highly skeptical of the BRI, the Five Star Movement wing of Italy\u2019s populist coalition government has observed the success of Greece\u2019s Piraeus Port, a majority share of which is held by COSCO, a Chinese state-owned enterprise. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte hopes to make Italy\u2019s own ports, notably those in Trieste and Genoa, similar entry points for Chinese trade with Europe. And while another group in the governing coalition\u2014the far-right League\u2014takes a dim view of engagement with China, during Xi\u2019s visit, Rome signed 29 deals worth $2.8 billion, wagering on Chinese investments to help pull it out of a grinding recession. Among other things, the deal is a reminder that the EU has not been able to offer its members attractive alternatives to Chinese investment."

    "text": "\n\n\n\nII. Brother Harresh: A Suitable Partner\n\nTrump\u2019s first major partner in India was a man named Harresh Mehta, the founder of Rohan Lifescapes, a real estate firm that has reaped massive profits from Mumbai\u2019s slum-redevelopment boom. In Mumbai, an island city in which there is almost no land left on which to build, real estate is among the most expensive in the world. Nearly half the city\u2019s twelve million people live in slums or informal housing settlements. Another 2.5 million hold below-market leases on tenements in crumbling pre-1940 buildings managed by the state. Over the past two decades, privatization has come to dominate municipal housing policy, with the city offering developers the chance to build market-rate housing in return for rehabilitating slums and old housing. In the process, many large slum properties have fallen into the hands of developers with access to foreign capital. \u201cDeveloping slum land is the only way to build in Mumbai now,\u201d Mehta told the Indian business newspaper Mint in 2008.\n\nMehta was a controversial figure in Mumbai long before he met the Trumps. Among the city\u2019s architects, public officials, and builders\u2014who refer to him as \u201cHarresh bhai\u201d or \u201cBrother Harresh\u201d\u2014he is known for his close connections to the most powerful elected officials in the state, including the influential BJP city chief, a former city council member. A senior state official and an architect with knowledge of operations at housing agencies and planning departments, both of whom spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Mehta\u2019s firms have been known to use bribes and even threats to secure his land deals, particularly in their efforts to meet a crucial legal requirement to gain prior consent from 70 percent of the residents of properties slated for redevelopment.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s smiling face proclaims that he is \u201cback,\u201d in a June 2016 billboard in Mumbai. Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nThese slums often sat on prime parcels of public land, and many redevelopment sites are now dotted with luxury residences, with the requirement to provide on-site housing for former residents largely ignored. According to three current and former government officials, Mehta was often able to swing lucrative deals from civil servants in the city planning department and state housing agencies, either, as one of them explained, by inflating the number of residents in rent-controlled buildings or by getting the land rezoned as a slum property\u2014which helped him to secure the maximum allowable construction rights and the cheapest deals and, ultimately, to attract millions of dollars in private equity funding. One of the officials was particularly blunt about Mehta\u2019s reputation: \u201cHe\u2019s a very shady character to partner with, there\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, Mehta acquired the rights to one of Mumbai\u2019s largest slum-redevelopment projects, in a place called Golibar, a sprawling 125-acre plot that was home to 26,000 families. To finance the project, one of Mehta\u2019s partners had arranged a $175 million stake from Lehman Brothers, just before it went under. Slum residents resisted the transformation of their community into a \u201cmixed-use\u201d redevelopment and in police complaints and lawsuits accused Mehta and his partners of an illegal land grab, using forged signatures to claim the 70 percent consent of existing residents. In late 2010 and early 2011, even as these legal challenges moved through the courts, demolitions began. Evictions followed, under heavy police presence, and as protests mounted, the story made national headlines. (The project stalled in 2011, due to the court challenges and the arrest of a director at one of Mehta\u2019s partners on the project, a well-known realty firm in New Delhi, in an unrelated corruption scandal. Seven years later, the rehabilitation has barely advanced.)\n\nAt this point, the Trumps were already in business with Mehta. Their partnership was brokered by a man named Kalpesh Mehta (no relation to Harresh), then a recent graduate of the Wharton School, where Trump, Donald Jr., and Ivanka all received their undergraduate degrees. After a short stint with the Carlyle Group in New York, Kalpesh became a vice president in Lehman\u2019s real estate private equity division in India, coordinating the firm\u2019s large investment into Harresh Mehta\u2019s play in Golibar.\n\nKalpesh\u2019s work on that deal must have impressed Brother Harresh, because he joined a Rohan subsidiary, Rohan Developers Private Limited, as a director in March 2010, and later that year was named a director of at least three other companies owned by Harresh Mehta and his family.\n\nIn February 2010, before Kalpesh Mehta joined the firm, Rohan had submitted plans to the city to redevelop a dilapidated hospital in an upscale south Mumbai neighborhood into a new 21-story residential tower. In May, two months after Kalpesh was brought on, Rohan submitted new plans for a much larger tower to be built on both the hospital site and a neighboring plot of land on which a rent-controlled building stood. By October of that year, the Trump Organization had registered two companies in Delaware, Trump Marks Mumbai LLC and Trump Marks Mumbai Managing Member Corporation, entities that would soon collect licensing fees for the significantly enlarged redevelopment project. Three months later, as Harresh Mehta\u2019s company was being pilloried in the Indian press for the evictions and alleged fraud in Golibar, Bloomberg reported that Trump was going to \u201calter Mumbai\u2019s luxury landscape\u201d by partnering with Rohan to build India\u2019s first Trump Tower.\n\nIt would have been nearly impossible for the Trumps to be unaware of the allegations against Harresh Mehta\u2019s company. There were dozens of stories about Golibar in the Indian media, including the English-language press. Any reasonable background check would have uncovered the ties between Harresh Mehta and the Golibar debacle. What\u2019s more, Donald Jr. had already made at least half a dozen trips to India and, according to Donald Trump himself, was heading the Mumbai project personally: \u201cHe\u2019s the one that\u2019s really working on this; he\u2019ll be there a lot,\u201d Trump said in a January 2011 interview with GQ India. Furthermore, Trump called Rohan \u201cfabulous people with a great track record,\u201d and added that he \u201cjust completely hit it off\u201d with the developers. \u201cThere was good chemistry, a good feeling.\u201d (Five months later, several of Mehta\u2019s companies were raided by income tax officials, according to a report in The Hindu. Mehta admitted to having $20 million in undisclosed income.)\n\nPrasad Panvalkar, a longtime resident of the site of the first Trump Tower Mumbai, accused Harresh Mehta\u2019s Rohan Lifescapes of using threats and coercion to force his family from its home. \u201cWe could not do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have muscle power and money power.\u201d Punit Paranjpe/AFP/Getty\n\nThe Trump Tower project almost immediately sparked controversy. Rohan\u2019s architects had told the city in May 2010 that the proposed redevelopment would be \u201centirely for the rehabilitation of the existing tenants only.\u201d Six months later, however, the firm had bought out almost all of the 26 long-term leases in the rent-controlled building on the second plot. The lone holdout was a single family with long ties to the neighborhood. I spoke with Prasad Panvalkar last April, in the cramped back room of his family\u2019s 70-year-old printing-ink business, a few blocks from his former home at the Trump site. Panvalkar, now in his late fifties, told me his wife, Smita, had been born and raised in the building and refused to accept a settlement that would require the family to relocate. When Panvalkar insisted on their legal right to an apartment in the new development, he said a director at the firm refused. Over the next few months, the Panvalkars endured repeated threats from representatives of Rohan, who warned that they had \u201call kinds of ways\u201d to force the family to leave, Panvalkar told me.\n\nThen, one night in May 2011, five months after the Trump Organization\u2019s licensing deal on the property was announced, the building caught fire. All the other tenants had already moved out, so the building was empty except for the Panvalkars. With the flames rising to the door of his family\u2019s second-floor apartment, Panvalkar said he jumped out of a window to seek assistance. \u201cMehta wanted the building to be burned so we would be forced to vacate,\u201d Panvalkar told me. \u201cThat was his point.\u201d Smita Panvalkar wrote an impassioned letter to the highest officials in the city and state about the fire, calling it \u201cdeliberate\u201d and a \u201cserious threat to our lives.\u201d Panvalkar said the city did not restore electricity to the building for six weeks, which the family told reporters was likely another pressure tactic to force them out. Smita Panvalkar died of a heart attack later that year. \u201cWe were helpless,\u201d Prasad said. \u201cWe could not do anything. They have muscle power and money power.\u201d (Panvalkar refused to move until June 2016, when he says Harresh Mehta personally agreed to give him an apartment in a new development.) Allegations against Mehta and his company were widely reported in the Mumbai press, with Mehta denying them all, telling reporters the Panvalkars were trying to \u201ctarnish our reputation.\u201d\n\nThere is, today, no Trump Tower on the site of the Panvalkars\u2019 old home. The deal, which Donald Trump was so high on that he described it to GQ as \u201cone of the most luxurious buildings in the world,\u201d fell apart in the spring of 2012. A Wall Street Journal interview with Donald Jr., in September 2013, attributed its demise to changes in the city\u2019s real estate rules, which would have required revisions to the tower that \u201cwouldn\u2019t have fit into the Trump standard.\u201d Yet hundreds of pages of city and state documents, as well as interviews with public officials, lawmakers, and architects familiar with the project, tell a very different story of the tower\u2019s collapse.\n\nInvestigative Fund reporter Anjali Kamat discusses this article on the Trump, Inc. podcast from WNYC and ProPublica.\n\nIn Mumbai, city and state officials determine how much a developer can legally construct on any plot of land, using a location-based formula that calculates the permissible square footage as a ratio of the footprint of the plot. A series of exemptions allows bureaucrats and politicians to grant developers much more square footage for certain categories of buildings, including redevelopment schemes for old buildings\u2014like the one that had been Panvalkar\u2019s home. Developers can also purchase a limited amount of additional construction rights, at rates set by the city based on the value of the land. In 2011, according to The Times of India, the realty rate for residential construction in the upscale, seafront Girgaum neighborhood, where the tower was planned, was about $800 per square foot.\n\nDevelopers were also permitted to claim certain building spaces like stairways, elevators, fire escapes, and fire refuge areas\u2014typically small spaces every few floors\u2014as exempt from the square-footage calculations. For high-rise buildings in expensive parts of Mumbai, however, where fees to the city can balloon into millions of dollars, these exemptions were often the subject of manipulation and fraud. Such was the case at the Mumbai Trump Tower.\n\nIn early 2011, a state lawmaker named Prakash Binsale, from the local Nationalist Congress Party, learned about a luxury building advertising enormous, 4,000- to 5,000-square-foot apartments in the middle of his district. A former urban planner, Binsale was suspicious about the size of the apartments, which seemed out of scale given the location. He pulled the related documents filed with the city and began to investigate. The permissible apartment size for the site was only about 1,500 square feet, but Rohan\u2019s plans claimed much more by designating large areas as fire refuges and fire decks, which he said could later be converted into rooms. \u201cThis was a blatant violation of the rules!\u201d Binsale told me.\n\nThe plot was situated between two major roads wide enough to accommodate large fire-fighting equipment. Binsale found it implausible, then, that the fire refuges served a legitimate safety purpose and was shocked that the plans were approved. He believed he had stumbled upon a fraud designed to allow the builder to construct a far larger building than the regulations permitted. \u201cThese clearances simply could not have happened without money,\u201d he said. \u201cI am absolutely certain that bribes were paid.\u201d Binsale calculated how much Mehta and the Trumps may have stood to gain from the plans. It was significant. Based on initial news reports of the prices of the apartments, which ran between $8 and $10 million, he estimated $100 million in additional profits from the illegal approvals alone.\n\nI tried to track down the three senior officials who signed off on the plans, in search of an explanation. One of them, the city\u2019s chief fire officer, died of a heart attack in 2011. According to news reports, he was posthumously indicted by the Anti-Corruption Bureau of the Mumbai police on an unrelated 2009 financial irregularities case. The city\u2019s executive engineer had retired and refused to answer any questions. Swadhin Kshatriya, the municipal commissioner, went on to become the chief secretary of the state government, the most powerful bureaucratic post in the state, and is now a state commissioner; he did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn a September 2011 letter to Mumbai\u2019s municipal commissioner, Binsale urged the city to cancel all approvals on the project, alleging \u201cgross violations\u201d of construction regulations. By then, in the wake of a wave of corruption scandals, Maharashtra\u2019s chief minister, akin to the governor of a U.S. state, had resigned, and Mumbai was\u2014for a brief interlude\u2014in a reform phase. The Congress Party, which governed the state at the time, brought in a replacement with a clean reputation, Prithviraj Chavan. Chavan appointed a new municipal commissioner, who tightened the rules around exempted spaces. The state\u2019s Urban Development department investigated the Trump approvals and, in an internal memo written at the end of the year, detailed five \u201cirregularities,\u201d including the approval of the massive fire decks. In January 2012, Harresh Mehta acknowledged to The Times of India that they had gone \u201cbeyond what was permitted,\u201d adding that under the new municipal commissioner, the city had become \u201cextremely strict.\u201d Three months later, all approvals on the tower were revoked. The deal was dead.\n\nThese clearances simply could not have happened without money,\u201d Binsale said of the Mumbai Trump Tower. \u201cI am absolutely certain that bribes were paid.\u201d\n\nTrump may have been aware of at least some aspects of these corrupt project designs. He boasted in the GQ article that the 65-story building would \u201conly have 45 apartments,\u201d a feature that made it \u201csuper-luxury,\u201d adding that he was working closely with the developers on the \u201cmagnificent architecture.\u201d It\u2019s hard to believe that he thought the units were going to be a mere 1,500 square feet.\n\nHe may also have gotten paid on the deal despite its demise. The illegal permits allowed Rohan to get past some of the city\u2019s initial regulatory hurdles and begin work on one-half of the plot. An earlier licensing agreement for a failed Trump condominium in Baja, Mexico, included a payment schedule based on construction benchmarks, according to a 2015 report in The Washington Post; if the Rohan deal was structured similarly, the fraudulent permits may have, on their own, triggered a substantial payout to the Trumps. Likewise, while Trump has not made public his licensing agreement with Rohan, the project would have at least delivered the up-front fee, which Trump\u2019s financial disclosures to the U.S. government describe as being paid as soon as any licensing agreement is signed. On another proposed Trump project in India, the up-front fee was $1 million, plus an \u201cincentive fee\u201d of $3.4 million, with additional payments of 4 percent of estimated revenues, based on a calculation of total square footage and expected sales prices, according to a draft memo we obtained. If fees for the Mumbai tower worked in this way, the illegal approvals would have boosted them dramatically. (Again, neither the Trump Organization nor Harresh Mehta responded to detailed questions about this deal or to repeated requests for comment.)\n\nIn April 2012, Donald Jr. made a final effort to revive the project. He traveled to Mumbai to meet with Prithviraj Chavan, the new chief minister of Maharashtra state. I spoke to Chavan, now a senior member of the Congress Party, and separately to an aide to the city commissioner who was also present at the meeting. Eager to attract foreign investment in the state, Chavan agreed to the meeting with Donald Jr., Harresh Mehta, and Kalpesh Mehta, but it turned into a lobbying session for the Trump Tower project, with the developers asking him to override the rejection of the permits, both Chavan and the aide confirmed. Chavan flatly refused to do so, explaining to us that he was not impressed by Donald Jr.\u2019s presence and could not grant them a \u201cspecial concession\u201d to approve something \u201cblatantly illegal.\u201d He would not \u201coverrule the lower people who were objecting to the project by saying that \u2018OK, I approve it,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cOut of the question.\u201d (Kalpesh Mehta also refused to respond to repeated requests for an interview or to any detailed questions for this story, but in 2016 he told The New York Times that the \u201cnotion that a request was made by Donald Jr. to waive any regulations is absolutely false.\u201d)\n\nOn that same trip, a reporter from the Indian news channel NDTV asked Donald Jr., who was in Pune at the time, about delays on the tower. Donald Jr. still seemed to think there was a way to save it. Rohan was \u201cfaced with regulatory issues like everyone else, so you know we\u2019re underway, and when that gets worked out we\u2019ll be going forward,\u201d he said, adding that he had a \u201cgreat partnership with them.\u201d But the Trump Organization\u2019s association with Brother Harresh ended not long afterward. In 2015, Harresh Mehta got fresh approvals from the city for a new project on the same site, less than half the size of the initial Trump Tower plans. Panvalkar is waiting for it to be completed, so he can move back home.\n\nIf the Trump family learned anything from the collapse of their first high-profile project in India, it seemed to be that they needed to find even more politically connected partners. In fact, the reason Donald Jr. was in Pune in April 2012 was to sign another brand-licensing deal, this one for twin residential Trump Towers, with a luxury real estate firm called Panchshil Realty, run by brothers Atul and Sagar Chordia. The Chordia brothers, who are among the richest people in India, were at the time best known for their long-standing ties to Sharad Pawar, a powerful political figure in the country, a former member of parliament, national cabinet minister, and Maharashtra chief minister. In 2011, debates in the state assembly as well as a series of prominent investigations in the English-language Indian press detailed how Pawar\u2019s influence had proved useful to the Chordias\u2019 real estate business, winning them handsome construction contracts and allowing them to amass several hundred acres of public land at below-market prices. Panchshil Realty did not respond to our requests for comment.\n\n\n\nReal estate is a \u201chome-grown game,\u201d Donald Jr. told the NDTV reporter. \u201cWe\u2019re very good at what we do, but we don\u2019t have the hubris to assume that we\u2019re the best in all markets, speaking to the regulatory side, to the political side of things.\u201d The Trump Organization \u201crecognized that it\u2019s important to have strong local partners,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone who\u2019s strong within the given cities that we\u2019re talking about. Because that\u2019s how to get things done.\u201d"

    "text": "But once you realize McConnell has already achieved his life\u2019s dream, and ascended to the limits of his ambition, his behavior suddenly starts to make more sense. He\u2019s not trying to cap off his career with a legislative masterstroke, because he doesn\u2019t care about legislation. He already won. He\u2019s the Senate majority leader, his parliamentary prowess is regularly feted, and he has already left his legacy indelibly inscribed on the highest court in the land.\n\nBeing a Senate majority leader who doesn\u2019t care about almost any particular outcome to any particular political issue not directly related to making sure your funders can fund you actually seems to take quite a bit of pressure off, job performance\u2013wise. Why go to bat to try to end a government shutdown when you don\u2019t actually care if the government is shut down? Here\u2019s Homans on McConnell\u2019s answer to the question, \u201cWhat do you see as your role, the majority leader\u2019s role, in a time of crisis?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d McConnell replied, \u201cI think what I have to do, my goal, and depending upon what the numbers are, and what\u2019s achievable, is always to get as right-of-center an outcome as possible.\u201d He brought up the example of the Budget Control Act of 2011, which we had been discussing: a bill produced from a high-stakes negotiation between the White House and congressional Republicans, in which McConnell, breaking with newly elected Tea Party hard-liners in the House, played dealmaker, providing the Democrats with bipartisan cover for a necessary debt-limit increase while also securing cuts that Republicans had sought. \u201cI mean, at the risk of sounding like I\u2019m patting myself on the back, who would have ever thought with Barack Obama in the White House you could get something like the Budget Control Act in August of 2011, which actually drove down government spending for two years in a row?\u201d McConnell said. \u201cTo me, given the numbers, and if you prefer America right of center, that\u2019s my definition of success.\u201d I was startled not just by his frankness but by the type of crisis that McConnell\u2019s mind had gone to, which was not exactly the kind of worst-case scenario that was foremost on many minds during Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nThis is an extremely funny answer to anyone who remembers recent political history. The Budget Control Act of 2011 was a temporary compromise intended to use the threat of a future catastrophe to force a larger and more lasting compromise. Republicans in Congress had threatened to refuse to raise the debt ceiling\u2014once more holding the basic operations of government hostage\u2014unless the Obama administration acceded to their demands for economic austerity. At effectively the last moment before economic disaster, Republicans and the White House negotiated the Budget Control Act of 2011, which called for the creation of a bipartisan deficit-reduction \u201csupercommittee\u201d to propose a truly bipartisan austerity package within a few months. If Congress failed to pass it or a similar package, a series of automatic budget cuts would go into effect. These cuts were designed to be anathema to both parties\u2014mostly because they would target defense spending, in addition to outlays for social spending and income supports. The entire point was that everyone would be incentivized to get a huge bipartisan deficit-reduction bill passed.\n\n\n\nThe supercommittee gave up after a few months and never sent anything to Congress. Congress delayed the punitive spending cuts for a while and then just let them go into effect. They are, in fact, still in effect\u2014but now Congress votes every few years to temporarily cancel some of the automatic cuts to discretionary spending. In other words, all this high-stakes procedural confrontation simply produced another pointless artificial cliff. And far from achieving some golden-mean version of sober, fiscally restrained governance, it only increased the likelihood that the framework of budgeting-by-extortion would be used to extract demands from some future president or Congress\u2014say, over a feckless plan to erect a wall to contain a nonexistent threat of rampaging immigrant criminality pouring across the Mexican border.\n\nThe fiscal cliff endgame was an outcome no one really wanted, which is what passes for \u201ccompromise\u201d and \u201cbipartisanship\u201d in some segments of the political press. And while it did cut spending for a few years, it did so at the expense of something President Obama was, at various points in his presidency, practically desperate to sign into law with Republican support: a package of massive permanent spending cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and other programs. Republicans had a Democratic president who wanted to help them achieve one of their supposed signature policy goals, and they simply refused to allow him to do it. McConnell\u2019s great victory was that he came in at the last minute to sign off on a deal designed to extort major policy outcomes that he and his party were solemnly pledged to support, but that his party then capsized out of pique and incompetence.\n\nMcConnell has nearly all of his Republican colleagues beat: His moderation itself was cynical.\n\nBut here we encounter another blank mystery for the oracles: Does Mitch McConnell really care if government spending rises or falls? Does he truly care if Social Security is privatized? His benefactors do, sure\u2014and he cares about what they want for what are (yet again) painfully obvious reasons. But any issue without direct relevance to McConnell\u2019s political fortunes is, for him, negotiable. Prior to the 2006 midterms, which were not looking good for the Republican Party, McConnell even advised President Bush to withdraw from Iraq to save the election. That\u2019s how much he cares about the conservative project, as opposed to electoral success. The neocons wanted power in order to use it to shape the world. McConnell wanted to shape the world into one in which he continues to have power, and he did. Which is all to say, if he had doubts about Trump in 2016, they evaporated on election night, just as his doubts about his fourth-ranked presidential choice did back in 1980.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s worth asking if we haven\u2019t been thinking about McConnell\u2019s political \u201cevolution\u201d all wrong from the beginning. Was he a liberal Republican\u2014who still talks about witnessing Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s March on Washington as a young Senate intern\u2014who cynically adapted to changing circumstances? Did he, like fellow pro-choice-Republican-turned-abortion-foe George H.W. Bush, sell out to win? Or was he just a Republican, period, who was a \u201cliberal\u201d one only because he then believed that was the most viable road to success in the party? He was strategically a Rockefeller Republican at a time when you could still make a bet that such socially moderate business types would survive the successive righteous onslaughts of the conservative movement. He has nearly all of his Republican colleagues beat: His moderation itself was cynical.\n\nIf McConnell\u2019s entire goal has been his political advancement within the Senate (which also requires supporting the Republican Party electorally by any means necessary), his career trajectory suddenly develops a tidy narrative throughline. He was a bit aimless in his early years in office, because he hadn\u2019t arrived in the Senate with an ideological mission. He randomly threw his support behind an expensive health care plan and even backed federally subsidized family leave to fend off his first Democratic challenger for reelection. It was not quite the record of a future party leader.\n\nBut he was consistent\u2014or rather, consistently inconsistent in one strategic direction\u2014about one issue: campaign finance, on which he very quickly developed a reputation as an expert. He knew fundraising was his primary political strength and probably the only reason he was even in office to begin with.\n\nHis problem was that, back in early 1990s, limiting money in politics was a popular and mostly bipartisan idea, and the main disagreements were about what kinds of money to restrict and how to do it. And over the years, McConnell shamelessly, fluidly recalibrated his arguments based on what was more useful to him, and then his party, at that moment.\n\nMacGillis patiently chronicles this process in his book: When McConnell felt he wasn\u2019t getting enough support from PACs, he wanted PACs banned. When he thought Democrats were outperforming Republicans with \u201csoft money\u201d\u2014 contributions from corporations and unions to parties, not individual candidates\u2014 McConnell wanted soft money banned. By the end of the \u201990s, when it was clear how much Republicans were benefiting from soft money, he was vociferously defending it from the attacks of his Republican Senate colleague John McCain, who\u2019d made it his mission to rein in political spending. For years, McConnell argued for disclosure of donors instead of spending restrictions. By the 2010s, when Democrats were pushing exactly that position to curb some of the deregulatory excesses of the Citizens United ruling\u2014which represents the closest thing you\u2019ll find to a lodestar for McConnell\u2019s belief system\u2014the Senate leader of course reversed himself yet again.\n\nHe also made an important rhetorical shift, one that tracked closely with his second great political crusade: enabling the slow but implacable death march of right-wing jurisprudence. Early on in McConnell\u2019s career, he mainly made his case for opposing campaign spending restrictions in pragmatic terms. But in 1995, he reversed his position on a flag-burning ban in order, critics charge, to more credibly pursue his new campaign of pushing all political spending as First Amendment\u2013\u200bprotected speech, aligning him with the conservative legal movement. (It may seem silly, but coming up with a principles-based reason for a decision that will have a politically or materially beneficial outcome for you or your side is a cornerstone of conservative legal theory.)\n\nThe most powerful Senate majority leader over the past decade is an errand boy for both an errant billionaire class of campaign donors, and an errant billionaire president.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting, as one wades through the brackish capitulations to plutocratic power that Mitch McConnell has always loudly and forcefully embraced as a vindication of his first principles, that his is a case in which the personal is very much political. When you spend so much of your time asking rich people for money, it does help to have a lot of it yourself, so you have something in common. Curiously, McConnell\u2019s own personal fortunes are frequently left out of his profiles, perhaps because it appears vaguely unseemly for reporters or editors to just come out and say the plain truth: He married into money, which had enormous political benefits. This is not to make any unsavory insinuation about the nature of his relationship with Elaine Chao\u2014it is, however, to note that she was a wealthy shipping heiress when they married, and he was effectively a lifelong politician who\u2019d barely sniffed the private sector. Even before the marriage, Chao\u2019s wealthy father had been a large Mitch McConnell donor; after, he became an even more enthusiastic one. He also gave the couple at least one reported gift of millions of dollars. In 2016, Mitch McConnell was estimated to be worth around $27 million.\n\nMcConnell knew first that unlimited fundraising was the key to his own political fortunes. He came to realize it was the best way for the Republicans to keep their power too, as unions declined and corporate power, along with income inequality, rose and rose. Republicans have a built-in advantage in a world of unlimited political spending. It took McConnell\u2019s forceful arguments with people like John McCain to get them all to come around to his way of thinking.\n\nMcConnell spent most of his career scheming to become the top Republican in the Senate, so it must have been a profound disappointment that he was not able to do so until 2007, by which time the Bush administration had so destroyed the reputation of the Republican Party that it had lost both houses of Congress. McConnell\u2019s Senate colleagues elected him minority leader in a blaze of powerless compromise. The remaining moderates thought they had chosen someone who\u2019d have their back as the party continued to lurch rightward. He absolutely would do anything to help any Republican senator keep their seat\u2014he tossed a couple of million dollars for infrastructure to Rhode Island to aid liberal GOP incumbent Lincoln Chafee\u2019s doomed reelection bid\u2014and he did exert some effort to keep the most extreme candidates from winning primaries (for electoral, not ideological, reasons). But if the GOP was trending wingnut and kept winning elections, McConnell would go along with that plan just as readily. (Chafee, for his part, mounted a brief run at the presidency in 2016\u2014as a Democrat.)\n\nThis is where the story of how Mitch McConnell saved the GOP begins. The infamous strategy that McConnell dreamed up and put into action to throttle any putative accomplishment of the Obama White House, no matter how nugatory, has become the stuff of right-wing parliamentary lore. We know the quote about his main priority being to make Obama a one-term president. It\u2019s easy to forget now, though, the long odds he faced.\n\nThe GOP after Bush should have been finished for a generation. It was utterly defeated, and a Democratic president had just been elected\u2014via the Democrats\u2019 fourth popular vote victory of the last five presidential elections\u2014in a near-\u200blandslide. Massive Democratic majorities were installed in both houses, and the Senate Democratic caucus flirted with the true golden ring of power: an actual filibuster-proof majority. The economy was in ruins, and everyone knew who was to blame for that: Republicans. The signature policy of the Bush administration, the Iraq War, was acknowledged by all to be a catastrophic failure. The situation looked about as bad for Republicans as it had on FDR\u2019s inauguration day. But they surged back into power almost immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of interconnected reasons for this, including but not restricted to: Barack Obama\u2019s early decision to move on from further investigation (let alone prosecution) of Bush administration officials; political choices made to prioritize stabilizing Wall Street over providing relief to homeowners; and the Democratic Party\u2019s long-term inability or unwillingness to treat the Republican Party as an extreme and malign force that must be defeated, instead of negotiated with. And McConnell can\u2019t take credit for personally creating the conditions that led to the plainly racist national backlash against the first black president (he has a few generations of predecessors in his party and the conservative movement to thank for that). But he does deserve the credit he has received for ruining the honeymoon: for taking a moment of national inspiration and almost immediately souring it. In 2009, Republican senators, like most senators in the old days, were still driven to cut deals and negotiate compromises to make themselves feel important. Democrats hungered to give them opportunities to have input into major legislation. \u201cI was determined to demonstrate how the Senate could still work,\u201d MacGillis quotes Connecticut Democrat Chris Dodd saying, after he duly sought Republican participation in the effort to craft a financial regulation bill. Of course, McConnell had to prove the opposite. And McConnell, as a political nihilist, always has an advantage over people determined to prove things work: It\u2019s much easier to simply make things not work, if the only outcome you care about is electoral.\n\nSo Republicans in Congress painstakingly drew out the negotiations over the Obama agenda while stigmatizing the results as rank political perfidy. They created and stoked, via the Koch-funded antics of the Tea Party, a national backlash against the Affordable Care Act. And against all odds, Republicans managed to take back the House two years into Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nEven so, the 2012 presidential election was another wake-up call: Americans still mostly hated Republicans and their ideas and their politicians. Some Republicans understood this and began circulating memos calling for the party to find ways to appeal to young people, Latino voters, and moderates. Others started laying the groundwork for a full-on revival of Pat Buchanan\u2019s herrenvolk brand of white populism."

    "text": "This language doesn\u2019t even bother to exonerate Trump\u2019s associate Roger Stone, who during the campaign was in cahoots with WikiLeaks as it dumped Russian-hacked emails that damaged Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Barr\u2019s statements only pertain to the Russian government, not Russian individuals or WikiLeaks or anyone else. This is a crucial distinction, given that we know the Trump campaign knew of and encouraged Stone\u2019s coordination with WikiLeaks.\n\nIn his testimony to Congress, Cohen revealed that Stone called Trump around July 19, 2016, to tell him about the upcoming WikiLeaks dump. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be nice,\u201d Cohen describes Trump responding. After the July 22 release of the emails, \u201ca senior Trump Campaign official was directed,\u201d Stone\u2019s indictment describes, without saying who did the directing, \u201cto contact STONE about any additional releases and what other damaging information\u201d WikiLeaks had on the Clinton campaign. In October 2016, WikiLeaks released emails stolen from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, deflecting attention away from a damning video showing Trump making sexually abusive comments; in response, \u201can associate of [a] high-ranking Trump Campaign official sent a text message to STONE that read \u2018well done,\u2019\u201d the indictment says.\n\nMore importantly, Barr\u2019s letter doesn\u2019t address something else Mueller investigated: whether a series of exchanges between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russians amounted to a crime. The sworn testimony of Trump\u2019s aides reveal that, at least through June 2016, he continued to pursue a $300 million real estate deal in Moscow that required Vladimir Putin\u2019s assistance. While hoping to land that deal, Trump\u2019s son, Don Jr., took a meeting with some Russians offering dirt on Clinton as \u201cpart of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump.\u201d At the end of the meeting, Don Jr. said his father would consider sanctions relief for Russia if he won.\n\nThen, on August 2, 2016, in the same meeting where Manafort gave Kilimnik polling data, he discussed a \u201cpeace\u201d deal in Ukraine that would also amount to sanctions relief for the Russians. Finally, after he was elected but before he was president, Trump undercut President Obama\u2019s response to the Russian hacks, suggesting that he would give Russia sanctions relief.\n\nThe hack-and-leak is not the crime Trump may have committed. It is, instead, a quid pro quo deal by which Russia would help Trump win and Trump would relieve Russia of the sanctions imposed for engaging in human rights violations, annexing Crimea, and hacking the election to help Trump win.\n\nIn deciding that Trump didn\u2019t obstruct justice after a paltry 48 hours of review, Barr \u201cconcluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\u201d He came to this conclusion\u2014in spite of saying during his confirmation hearings that what Trump is known to have done amounts to obstruction\u2014because Mueller found that \u201cthe evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not the crime that, the evidence quite clearly shows, Trump may have committed. This is not the crime that Manafort appears to have lied about in hopes of getting a pardon.\n\nIn giving Trump the all-clear on obstruction charges, Barr appears not to have considered whether Trump obstructed the actual crime in question. He instead considered whether the president obstructed a different crime. This is the legal sleight of hand that has allowed Barr to proclaim that Trump will not be charged.\n\nThe Democratic-controlled House Judiciary Committee now has abundant reason to get all the underlying materials from the Mueller inquiry, because the attorney general just cleared the president of something he agreed constituted a crime just a few months ago."

    "text": "Journalists as well as former State Department spokesperson John Kirby were appalled. \u201cThese officials are public servants,\u201d Kirby told CNN. \u201cWhat they say\u2014in its entirety\u2014is inherently of public interest.\u201d Particularly, he added, on a topic as \u201cuniversally relevant as religious freedom in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nOne of the media organizations on the call, Religion News Service (not itself a faith-based publication, but a secular outlet that covers the religion beat), reported a partial list of other participants, including the Jewish wire service Jewish Telegraphic Agency; the center-right Jewish magazine Algemeiner; the evangelical World Magazine; and two Catholic publications, America magazine and the newspaper of the Catholic Archdiocese of Kansas City.\n\nNotably missing from this line-up were any Muslim media organizations, remarkable given the call\u2019s reported inclusion of the administration\u2019s soon-to-be-released Israel-Palestine peace plan.\n\nMonday\u2019s call wasn\u2019t the first time that Pompeo\u2019s department has privileged faith-based media over mainstream reporters. Last July, just ahead of the department\u2019s first-ever \u201cministerial for international religious freedom,\u201d as New York Times religion reporter Elizabeth Dias noted on Twitter, Pompeo had sit-down interviews with four evangelical news outlets, including the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), before a press conference call where evangelical publications World Magazine and Christianity Today were picked first for questions, and mainstream newspapers, including The New York Times and The Washington Post, were only invited to pose questions at the end of the call. And evangelical figures have also had enhanced access to policy decisions. In early March, the administration hosted a meeting with evangelical leaders\u2014including prominent (and deeply controversial) Christian Zionist leaders like Pastor John Hagee\u2014to \u201chear any concerns and red lines\u201d they might have on a potential Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, according to an Axios source, and to reassure them that any plan would protect Israeli interests.\n\nCBN\u2019s sit-down with Mike Pompeo was only the latest episode in the network\u2019s close relationship with the Trump administration\u2014one that, as Al Jazeera argued last fall, is just as mutually beneficial as the better-known link to Fox & Friends, but is often overlooked as a part of the administration\u2019s effective state media because of the niche audience it targets. CBN\u2019s audience, and its interests, both help explain the administration\u2019s policy moves and may exert influence on them, appealing to a president known for being easily swayed by flattery.\n\nCBN\u2019s stated mission is to ready the U.S. \u201cfor the coming of Jesus Christ.\u201d To that end, it focuses heavily on Middle East issues. It airs the weekly program Jerusalem Dateline, and regularly features guests like Joel Rosenberg, the author of a series of Middle East-set evangelical apocalyptic or political thriller novels and a member of Pompeo\u2019s inner circle, who has helped broker interviews between the Secretary and the network. Earlier this month, Rosenberg appeared on CBN to discuss his latest work of fiction, The Persian Gamble, which posits that Iran used U.S. money to buy North Korean nukes. Rosenberg said he\u2019d recently explained the book\u2019s plot to President Trump. \u201cHow do you know that\u2019s not happening already?\u201d Trump apparently replied.\n\nThe steady undercurrent to CBN\u2019s focus is the Christian Zionist conviction that the return of Christ depends on a specific scenario involving the return of Jews to Israel. It\u2019s a belief that Pompeo seems to share, having told a Kansas church audience in 2015 to keep fighting \u201cuntil the rapture.\u201d\n\nEven amid an administration stacked with evangelical staffers and advisors, Pompeo stands out. As former CIA director he described the \u201cwar on terror\u201d as a holy war and said the U.S. \u201cworshipped other gods and called it multiculturalism.\u201d He now readily tells audiences about how he keeps a Bible open on his State Department desk to remind him of God\u2019s truth. One of the driving motivators of Pompeo\u2019s State Department increasingly seems to be what Gardiner calls \u201cwell-documented beliefs in the prophetic necessity of the establishment of a \u2018Greater Israel\u2019 in order to usher in the End Times\u201d\u2014hardly a stabilizing central principle in an era of nuclear risk. Meanwhile, holding \u201cseparate interviews with religious broadcasters,\u201d Gardiner pointed out, means \u201creaching the white evangelicals who are the single most unwavering part of the voting base of an embattled president.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get distracted by the secular spectacle of Trump\u2019s manic Twitter feed, filled with arbitrary bits of outrage or lavish praise, depending on whichever leader has flattered him lately. But as last week showed, better than others, there\u2019s a more disciplined administrative force at work behind the scenes, crafting an intensely ideological foreign policy."

    "text": "Go further down the line: There\u2019s no moment of political reform, no widening of the promise of liberalism to oppressed groups within the nation, that didn\u2019t entail a projection of power outside the nation. The interdependent relationship between domestic reform and foreign expansion is complicated. Sometimes the link was ideological: Breaking up the Spanish Empire in the Caribbean and the Philippines, Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson believed, would create a sense of national purpose that could be used to break up the trusts at home. Other times the link was nakedly transactional: Some suffragists would trade Woodrow Wilson their support for U.S. entry into World War I for his support for their campaign, as did some trade unionists for labor reform.

The interdependent relationship between domestic reform and foreign expansion is complicated. Sometimes the link was ideological: Breaking up the Spanish Empire in the Caribbean and the Philippines, Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson believed, would create a sense of national purpose that could be used to break up the trusts at home. Other times the link was nakedly transactional: Some suffragists would trade Woodrow Wilson their support for U.S. entry into World War I for his support for their campaign, as did some trade unionists for labor reform.

    "text": "\u201cI am going to run for something. And I will tell you in April,\u201d she said earlier this month. \u201cBut everything is on the table. I\u2019m not being coy. This is hard. When you spend two years focusing on one thing, it\u2019s not easy to turn to something else.\u201d A Senate seat, she said in a recent speech at Vanderbilt University, would be \u201can indirect solution to some of the challenges I see.\u201d She smilingly hinted at what she really wants next: \u201cRevenge can be very cathartic,\u201d she said.\n\nBy ousting Kemp, Abrams would be setting herself up\u2014again\u2014as the model for a revivified Democratic Party going forward. She\u2019d be formidable in a 2022 rematch, not only because her statewide voter-engagement project has worked wonders, but also because of the state\u2019s fast-evolving demographics\u2014with its rapidly growing African American, Latino, and Asian populations, Georgia\u2019s on a fast track to be majority-nonwhite in the next decade. As the first liberal governor of a Deep South state\u2014like, ever\u2014she could show how to bring progressive governance and reform to a state that isn\u2019t overwhelmingly blue like California or New York. The considerable savvy she showed as House minority leader in Georgia leaves little doubt that she\u2019d be a consequential governor. And that would put her in an even stronger position to pursue the White House in 2028 or later. She\u2019s only 45, so there\u2019s ample time on her side.\n\nBy eschewing national politics for now, Abrams would be taking a powerful symbolic stand against the recent drift of the Democratic Party\u2014in stark contrast to O\u2019Rourke and Juli\u00e1n Castro, who\u2019ve given up on changing Texas to pursue long-shot presidential bids. (Castro\u2019s twin brother, U.S. Representative Joaquin Castro, is challenging Republican Senator John Cornyn in 2020, though.) She\u2019s already forged a new path for Democrats to compete in red states, running successfully as a full-on progressive rather than falling back on \u201cconservative values.\u201d And after she lost her disputed election to Kemp, she demonstrated the kind of fighting spirit that Democrats have also been sorely lacking for a long time, stubbornly refusing to go through the motions of graciously accepting defeat to an opponent who rigged his own election. \u201cI don\u2019t concede that I lost,\u201d she said in March for the umpteenth time. \u201cI feel very comfortable saying that this election was not fair, and not only was it not fair, it was not accurate.\u201d\n\nBut rather than just complaining, or lighting out on a self-pity tour \u00e0 la O\u2019Rourke, she went to work after the election to make sure that such an injustice couldn\u2019t happen again\u2014to any Democrat. She turned her campaign operation into a political action group, Fair Fight, that\u2019s working to democratize elections in Georgia and elsewhere; the group filed what could become a landmark federal lawsuit challenging the \u201cgross mismanagement\u201d of the state\u2019s elections. As she\u2019s been making the rounds on a far-flung speaking tour\u2014wowing crowds in Las Vegas, San Francisco, New York, and Oxford University, as well as on late-night TV\u2014she\u2019s continued to flash the big, broad grin and ferocious brain that lit up the campaign trail in Georgia, displaying her rare talent for pursuing her ambitions while conveying that she\u2019s not in politics just because of what she wants to be, but what she wants to do.\n\nStacey Abrams should run for anything she damn well pleases, anytime she wants. With all due apologies to O\u2019Rourke, she is the next-generation Democrat who was \u201cborn to be in it.\u201d If she sees a route to the presidency in 2020, she should go for it; if she thinks she could make a real difference in the Senate, she should give that a shot. But she\u2019s already shown that you don\u2019t need the rhetorical pedestal of a seat in Congress to be the country\u2019s most influential champion for voting rights. And while vanquishing Kemp and becoming governor of Georgia in 2022 might strike establishment pundits and Democrats as sadly unsexy, it might just be the most important task she could undertake\u2014for her party, for the progressive cause, and also for her own limitless political future."

    "text": "There were plenty of contenders for the biggest news story this week. North Carolina officials ordered a new election on Thursday in the state\u2019s 9th congressional district after hearing testimony about widespread absentee-ballot fraud during last fall\u2019s race. Dramatic testimony from the son of Mark Harris, the Republican candidate who officially received the most votes last November, revealed that he had warned his father last year that a local political operative\u2019s ballot collection plan was likely illegal. The Republican Party often invokes the illusory menace of widespread voter fraud; now they\u2019ve had an election victory overturned for election fraud themselves.\n\nAnother contender would be the arrest of Christopher Hasson, a Coast Guard lieutenant in Maryland, for allegedly planning to carry out a targeted killing spree against prominent journalists and Democratic lawmakers. Federal prosecutors warned a judge earlier this week that he sought \u201cto murder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country.\u201d Hasson\u2019s plan, court filings suggest, was to use the killings as part of a broader campaign to secure a \u201cwhite homeland\u201d within the United States. It\u2019s the second time in six months that one of President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters has been arrested while allegedly plotting to kill his political opponents.\n\nBut one story received more media coverage than either of those, or any other this week: the arrest of Empire actor Jussie Smollett for filing a false police report in Chicago. Smollett, who is black and gay, told police earlier this month that he had been attacked by two white men who shouted \u201cThis is MAGA country,\u201d used racial and homophobic slurs, poured an unidentified liquid on him, and tied a noose around his neck. Investigators now say that Smollett paid two other men to help stage the apparent hate crime, potentially out of frustration with his salary and screen time on the popular Fox drama. Smollett denies the allegations.\n\nCritics seized on the Smollett episode to make broad pronouncements about the American left and the journalists that covered his story. There\u2019s a certain irony about this, as the frenzy of coverage has obscured other news stories that tell deeper truths about the current political moment. For all the ways in which conservatives claim that mainstream news outlets are biased toward liberals, the last week shows how conservative narratives still get privileged in mainstream political discourse."

    "text": "Start with the biggest question of all: Did the president and his campaign collude with Russia to sabotage Clinton\u2019s candidacy? According to Barr, Mueller \u201cdid not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts.\u201d Trump and his supporters already are claiming this means he did not collude with Russia, but there\u2019s a key difference. As a prosecutor, Mueller had to determine not only whether anyone\u2019s actions amounted to a crime, but whether all elements of that crime could be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. That\u2019s a formidable threshold to clear in this case without a smoking gun like the Nixon White House tapes.\n\nThere is plenty of evidence of \u201csoft collusion,\u201d or a mutually beneficial understanding between Trump Tower and Moscow, without an explicit quid pro quo. Trump publicly embraced Russian foreign policy aims on NATO membership and economic sanctions while Russian agents reached out to his campaign. He appears to have done nothing to dissuade them in private or in public, nor did he alert anyone about a foreign power\u2019s efforts to influence an American election. In fact, he openly called on the Russian government to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server and release its contents, while his eldest son welcomed the prospect of meeting a Russian government official who purportedly offered \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton. And he repeatedly lied about his business efforts in Russia, thereby opening himself up to blackmail by a foreign power.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions demonstrated a clear lack of moral and civic integrity. But not everything that\u2019s wrong is\u2014or should be\u2014a crime. Mueller\u2019s task was to determine whether the Trump campaign ever crossed that line. The president did not make it easy. He fired FBI Director James Comey after urging him to go easy on Trump campaign senior adviser Michael Flynn for lying to investigators about his Russian contacts, attempted to fire the special counsel at least twice, sought to place loyalists in command of the investigation, and dangled pardons for would-be witnesses to deter them from cooperating. It\u2019s impossible to know what Paul Manafort, the imprisoned former chairman of Trump\u2019s campaign, might have told investigators without those implicit pardon offers. But if Mueller still believes there was no evidence of hard collusion, that\u2019s as conclusive an answer as any of us are likely to get.\n\nThat leaves the question of whether Trump obstructed justice. Here is where things get murky. Mueller himself wrote that \u201cwhile this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\u201d Barr told Congress that Mueller decided against drawing any conclusions on the matter himself, and instead laid out the evidence and the \u201cdifficult issues\u201d surrounding whether a president can obstruct justice. Barr says that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein then decided that Mueller had not found evidence \u201csufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\n\nBarr told Congress that Mueller\u2019s conclusion that there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to prosecute an underlying crime played a role in their own conclusion on obstruction, but it was not \u201cdeterminative.\u201d His reasoning is grounded in the elements of the crime itself. \u201cIn cataloguing the president\u2019s actions, many of which took place in public view, the report identifies no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent, each of which [...] would need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish an obstruction-of-justice offense,\u201d Barr told Congress in the letter."

    ],
    "text": "Muller left Moscow permanently in 1937, and won the Nobel Prize in 1946. Deeply offended by Lysenkoism, he threw himself into the work of an anti-totalitarian activist. When a Cultural and Scientific Congress for World Peace was held in New York City in 1949, featuring Soviet delegates and a message of peaceful coexistence with the USSR, anti-Communists were incensed with the lack of criticism of the Soviet system. Muller appeared at a counter-conference, speaking about the \u201cDestruction of Science in the USSR,\u201d and arguing that \u201cThe Communist Party regards as a menace any concept that does not fit patly into its scheme for mankind.\u201d\n\nThe CIA took an interest in the protest, and backed an elaborate response to the \u201cPeace\u201d activism that had become one of the key features of Soviet post-war propaganda campaigns. Muller gave the second paper at the inaugural session of the Congress for Cultural Freedom in Berlin in 1950. He warned of the threat to science from despotism \u201cmasquerading under the name of \u2018national socialism\u2019 or \u2018international communism\u2019\u201d and he defended the \u201cright to think differently, to question, and to express our disagreements.\u201d The CIA financed the Congress for Cultural Freedom so that it grew into a globe-spanning network that published books and magazines and held exhibitions and conferences. The CCF became the centerpiece of the CIA\u2019s attempt to create a hospitable place for intellectual anti-Communism.\n\nThough best known for its work with artists and writers, the CCF also maintained a science program. (The journal Minerva, which still exists, began as a publication of the CCF in 1962.) The CCF sponsored a major conference in 1953, bringing more than 100 scientists to Hamburg to raise awareness of the mistreatment of scholars under totalitarianism. It started a Committee on Science and Freedom in 1954. But the layers of financial and managerial misdirection required to maintain a front organization also meant that its effects could sometimes be oblique to U.S. security goals.\n\nThe first publication on scientific matters that the CCF supported was called Science and Freedom. But while CCF headquarters in Paris hoped that the journal would continue to cover issues of totalitarianism, its new editor George Polanyi had other ideas. At first glance, he had seemed the ideal candidate. He was the son of the chemist Michael Polanyi, who was active in the CCF and a strong opponent of government planning in science. (Michael, in turn, was the brother of political economist and social democrat Karl Polanyi, with whom he had serious disagreements about Cold War politics. Even in the 1950s Karl warned his brother to disentangle himself \u201cfrom the parasites of the Cold War,\u201d and said that the CIA\u2019s involvement in shaping the idea of freedom was contrary to Michael\u2019s own commitment against government involvement in intellectual inquiry.)\n\n\n\nGeorge Polanyi (aided by his wife Priscilla, who did a good deal of the work for no compensation or recognition) mostly ignored attempts at guidance from the CCF secretariat. They sent material that he simply chose not to publish. Instead of focusing on the poor treatment of scientific workers under totalitarianism, he was more interested in exploring restrictions on academic freedom in the West, such as racial exclusion at the University of Alabama and apartheid at the University of Cape Town. He devoted little attention to conditions under Communism, and in 1960 even ran an article about Chinese universities that argued that academics might be better off under Mao than in many other countries, including non-Communist ones. Science and Freedom was soon enough done in and replaced by the more professional Minerva, but it is hard to see the magazine as having done much to advance U.S. hegemony.\n\nEven in the 1950s Karl Polanyi warned his brother that the CIA\u2019s involvement in shaping the idea of freedom was contrary to his own commitments.\n\nThe general portrait that Wolfe offers is of a scientific world thoroughly infiltrated by government interests but not necessarily in lock-step with government goals. Science attach\u00e9s were used for intelligence collection in the 1950s. The supposedly independent \u201cPugwash\u201d gatherings, where Soviets scientists gathered with their Western counterparts to discuss matters including the dangers of radioactive fallout, were initially seen by the CIA as Communist propaganda. But the American head of the Pugwash Continuing Committee, Eugene Rabinowitch (who was also editor of the widely distributed Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists), began cooperating with the U.S. government, which proceeded to use Pugwash meetings as opportunities for backchannel communications.\n\nAfter the Soviets\u2019 successful launch of Sputnik in 1958, there was a considerable effort to reform science curriculum in U.S. high schools. To meet the challenge posed by Soviet technology, the new curriculum sought to introduce scientific thinking as a \u201cway of knowing,\u201d not just a collection of facts. There were reforms made in physics and chemistry teaching, but it was in biology that a new approach was most widely adopted. There, the emphasis was on the evidence-based nature of science\u2014making Lysenko the absent foil.\n\nThe Asia Foundation, a CIA proprietary whose budget was considerably larger that of the CCF, wanted to help get those textbooks into classrooms around the world. By 1971 adaptations were under way in more than 35 countries; and the Asia Foundation was determined that these versions reflect local fauna and agricultural practices, for example, to avoid the appearance of cultural imperialism. When a textbook was pirated in Taiwan, the Asia Foundation tried to make sure that the directly copied version was not used. \u201cA CIA proprietary,\u201d writes Wolfe, \u201cbacked the book that looked less American on the theory that it would more effectively convey the US approach to science instruction.\u201d When, in the late 1960s, it was revealed that the Asia Foundation and the CCF were CIA fronts, the CCF revelations caused a scandal. By contrast, the news about the Asia Foundation (which still exists, now under the budgetary authority of the State Department) was met mostly with shrugs.\n\nGiven the relatively ineffective nature of much of this activity, some may feel a tug of nostalgia for a time when the CIA thought it worthwhile to sponsor nearly unread journals and textbooks promoting inquiry-based learning. Compared to the violence that the agency sponsored at the same time, these forays into science might seem harmless. Yet U.S. global power has also always depended on having certain features that were attractive to many people, and scientific internationalism might have been a part of that.\n\nIn 2019, it\u2019s perhaps easier to see how politicized science can be in the United States. In an epilogue to the book, Wolfe writes that Trump\u2019s attitude towards climate science reminds her of nothing so much as Lysenkoism. The mechanisms are not the same, of course, and the United States is institutionally pluralistic in a way that limits the repressive power of the state over scientists. Yet the consequences of official denial may still be grave. In a further irony, climate change denialism is a \u201cparty truth,\u201d associated with Republican elected officials. Scientists who have raised the alarm are accused of being part of a liberal plot to socialize America.\n\n\u201cParty truths\u201d were one of the ideas that Cold Warriors sought to defeat. There is no such thing as \u201cbourgeois science\u201d they would say: That is a totalitarian slur. There is only science. Their solution was \u201cfree\u201d science in a liberal democracy, but the equation of liberal democracy with free scientific inquiry has not turned out to be so simple. The dismissal of climate science as \u201cliberal science\u201d rather than just science, has not occurred under a totalitarian regime. That it has occurred under capitalism is by no means incidental, because much of the work to muddy the waters on the science has come from groups that stand to profit from fossil fuel extraction.\n\nIt is difficult to ignore how extensively capitalism shapes the nature of scientific production. Scientific research from agriculture to medicine is directed towards profitable potential discoveries, not those that would necessarily do the most social good. Furthermore, scientists during the Cold War and today face the reality that research possibilities are frequently linked to national security goals and through them, the defense of global inequalities. Carefully researched works on the Cultural Cold War, like Freedom\u2019s Laboratory, reveal what a murky world we have inherited. Scientists fighting against restrictions on their profession used the language of crusading anti-Communism, defining their work as apolitical and therefore free. But it was neither.\n\nThe point is not, as Wolfe argues clearly, that \u201cfreedom\u201d is an impossible value to hold, nor that scientific internationalism isn\u2019t worth defending, nor that the fiction of apolitical science means that science is better off being relentlessly politicized. The point, rather, is that power and knowledge are always entwined. During the Cold War, American institutions were assumed to be ideal by default. We now know more than enough to understand that they were not, and that the task of making them better belongs to us."

    "text": "Journalists as well as former State Department spokesperson John Kirby were appalled. \u201cThese officials are public servants,\u201d Kirby told CNN. \u201cWhat they say\u2014in its entirety\u2014is inherently of public interest.\u201d Particularly, he added, on a topic as \u201cuniversally relevant as religious freedom in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nOne of the media organizations on the call, Religion News Service (not itself a faith-based publication, but a secular outlet that covers the religion beat), reported a partial list of other participants, including the Jewish wire service Jewish Telegraphic Agency; the center-right Jewish magazine Algemeiner; the evangelical World Magazine; and two Catholic publications, America magazine and the newspaper of the Catholic Archdiocese of Kansas City.\n\nNotably missing from this line-up were any Muslim media organizations, remarkable given the call\u2019s reported inclusion of the administration\u2019s soon-to-be-released Israel-Palestine peace plan.\n\nMonday\u2019s call wasn\u2019t the first time that Pompeo\u2019s department has privileged faith-based media over mainstream reporters. Last July, just ahead of the department\u2019s first-ever \u201cministerial for international religious freedom,\u201d as New York Times religion reporter Elizabeth Dias noted on Twitter, Pompeo had sit-down interviews with four evangelical news outlets, including the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), before a press conference call where evangelical publications World Magazine and Christianity Today were picked first for questions, and mainstream newspapers, including The New York Times and The Washington Post, were only invited to pose questions at the end of the call. And evangelical figures have also had enhanced access to policy decisions. In early March, the administration hosted a meeting with evangelical leaders\u2014including prominent (and deeply controversial) Christian Zionist leaders like Pastor John Hagee\u2014to \u201chear any concerns and red lines\u201d they might have on a potential Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, according to an Axios source, and to reassure them that any plan would protect Israeli interests.\n\nCBN\u2019s sit-down with Mike Pompeo was only the latest episode in the network\u2019s close relationship with the Trump administration\u2014one that, as Al Jazeera argued last fall, is just as mutually beneficial as the better-known link to Fox & Friends, but is often overlooked as a part of the administration\u2019s effective state media because of the niche audience it targets. CBN\u2019s audience, and its interests, both help explain the administration\u2019s policy moves and may exert influence on them, appealing to a president known for being easily swayed by flattery.\n\nCBN\u2019s stated mission is to ready the U.S. \u201cfor the coming of Jesus Christ.\u201d To that end, it focuses heavily on Middle East issues. It airs the weekly program Jerusalem Dateline, and regularly features guests like Joel Rosenberg, the author of a series of Middle East-set evangelical apocalyptic or political thriller novels and a member of Pompeo\u2019s inner circle, who has helped broker interviews between the Secretary and the network. Earlier this month, Rosenberg appeared on CBN to discuss his latest work of fiction, The Persian Gamble, which posits that Iran used U.S. money to buy North Korean nukes. Rosenberg said he\u2019d recently explained the book\u2019s plot to President Trump. \u201cHow do you know that\u2019s not happening already?\u201d Trump apparently replied.\n\nThe steady undercurrent to CBN\u2019s focus is the Christian Zionist conviction that the return of Christ depends on a specific scenario involving the return of Jews to Israel. It\u2019s a belief that Pompeo seems to share, having told a Kansas church audience in 2015 to keep fighting \u201cuntil the rapture.\u201d\n\nEven amid an administration stacked with evangelical staffers and advisors, Pompeo stands out. As former CIA director he described the \u201cwar on terror\u201d as a holy war and said the U.S. \u201cworshipped other gods and called it multiculturalism.\u201d He now readily tells audiences about how he keeps a Bible open on his State Department desk to remind him of God\u2019s truth. One of the driving motivators of Pompeo\u2019s State Department increasingly seems to be what Gardiner calls \u201cwell-documented beliefs in the prophetic necessity of the establishment of a \u2018Greater Israel\u2019 in order to usher in the End Times\u201d\u2014hardly a stabilizing central principle in an era of nuclear risk. Meanwhile, holding \u201cseparate interviews with religious broadcasters,\u201d Gardiner pointed out, means \u201creaching the white evangelicals who are the single most unwavering part of the voting base of an embattled president.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get distracted by the secular spectacle of Trump\u2019s manic Twitter feed, filled with arbitrary bits of outrage or lavish praise, depending on whichever leader has flattered him lately. But as last week showed, better than others, there\u2019s a more disciplined administrative force at work behind the scenes, crafting an intensely ideological foreign policy."

    "text": "The Obama administration viewed Orb\u00e1n\u2019s demonization of refugees as part of a larger anti-democratic campaign to silence political opposition, stifle the free press, erode the independence of the judiciary, and scapegoat supposed outsiders as conspirators against Hungary\u2019s sovereignty. A few days before Rohrabacher\u2019s committee hearing, Colleen Bell, the U.S. ambassador to Hungary, delivered a public condemnation of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s open xenophobia. \u201cEvery sovereign nation has the right to protect its borders,\u201d Bell said. \u201cBut every nation, as a part of the international community, also has a fundamental obligation to help refugee populations seeking safety. Words of intolerance and xenophobic characterizations of refugees\u2014some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people\u2014as invaders and antagonists have no role in our efforts to find a solution.\u201d\n\nThat line of criticism did not sit well with Rohrabacher. At the committee hearing a few days later, the congressman thanked Hungary\u2019s then-ambassador to the United States, R\u00e9ka Szemerk\u00e9nyi, for attending. The right-wing lawmaker then praised Hungary as a \u201ctremendous friend and asset to the peace and stability of the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am personally upset,\u201d Rohrabacher continued, \u201cthat our administration has sought to find out and try to complain about every little thing they disagree with, with Hungary. Hungary has every right to set their own policies, and I am pleased that Hungary has a track record of doing good things with the United States.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Rohrabacher\u2019s support for Orb\u00e1n placed him outside the political mainstream in the United States. Obama White House officials weren\u2019t the only public figures calling out Orb\u00e1n\u2019s strongman rule; Republicans were as well. In 2014, Arizona Senator John McCain called Orb\u00e1n \u201ca neofascist dictator getting in bed with Vladimir Putin\u201d and accused him of \u201cpracticing the same kinds of anti-democratic practices\u201d as the Russian president. And in the years immediately following Hungary\u2019s admission into nato in 1999, the George W. Bush administration also confronted Orb\u00e1n when he departed from basic commitments to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law\u2014criticism that Orb\u00e1n believed cost him his bid for reelection in 2002, and that fueled his animosity toward the United States.\n\nThis broader consensus on authoritarian rule in Hungary rendered Rohrabacher a bit of a pariah among some of his Republican colleagues, the foreign policy heavyweights. \u201cThere\u2019s a lunatic fringe in every organization,\u201d McCain said of Rohrabacher in 2016. But while Rohrabacher may have been on the outs with some Republicans, he made fast friends with like-minded politicians across the Atlantic. And when figures like Orb\u00e1n looked at Rohrabacher, they saw a kindred spirit.\n\nOther Republican lawmakers associated with the strongman caucus embraced Europe\u2019s far-right nationalists long before Trump\u2019s election. In April 2015, King, the Iowa Republican known for his virulent anti-immigrant diatribes and racist tweets, invited Geert Wilders, the founder of the Netherlands\u2019 far-right Party for Freedom, to speak to a weekly breakfast gathering of House Republicans. There, Wilders issued a call to arms. \u201cOur duty is clear,\u201d he told the lawmakers. \u201cWe have to stop mass immigration to the West from Islamic countries. And we have to get rid of the cultural relativism.\u201d\n\nKing was eager to spread the word. \u201cGeert Wilders speaking now before Members of Congress & national security experts,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIslam will not assimilate. Western culture is superior.\u201d The next day, the congressman called a press conference on the Capitol grounds. Flanked by fellow Republican Representatives Gohmert and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, King argued that the United States needed to form tighter bonds with Europe\u2019s nationalist leaders. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to expand and build our networks across the ocean, and to tie together the anchor that is Western civilization,\u201d he said. In 2016, Wilders secured an invitation to the Republican National Convention.\n\nFar-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders on Capitol Hill in April 2015, flanked by GOP lawmakers Louie Gohmert (left) and Steve King (right) Brendan Smialowski/AFP.Getty\n\nMainstream GOP leaders have long regarded King, like, Rohrabacher, as a loudmouth on the party\u2019s far-right flank. In 2013, after King accused undocumented immigrants of having \u201ccalves the size of cantaloupes because they\u2019re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert,\u201d Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner condemned the comments as \u201cdeeply offensive and wrong\u201d and said King\u2019s remarks did not \u201creflect the values of the American people, or the Republican Party.\u201d (Later, when King\u2019s comments were brought up in a private conversation, Boehner reportedly replied, \u201cWhat an asshole.\u201d) Boehner resigned from Congress in 2015, however\u200b\u2014forced out by the ascendant far-right Freedom Caucus\u2014and the current Republican leadership was long disinclined to criticize King for his outlandish remarks, particularly as his views gained currency in Trump\u2019s Washington. During the 2016 election cycle, Republican presidential hopefuls sought King\u2019s endorsement ahead of the Iowa caucuses, and Ted Cruz named King co-chair of his presidential campaign. Last June, when King approvingly retweeted a well-known Nazi sympathizer, House Republican leaders remained silent. It was only in January, after King explicitly defended white supremacy in an interview with The New York Times, that House GOP leaders finally sanctioned him, stripping him of his committee assignments, a move that King\u2019s far-right and evangelical defenders roundly denounced.\n\nIn November 2015, with the presidential primaries in full swing, and just after Rohrabacher held his hearing on the refugee crisis, King traveled to Europe to investigate the crisis himself. The trip, which went unnoticed in the national media, was recorded in the congressional record as official business of the House Judiciary Committee, on which King served. But King was the only lawmaker to go\u2014an unusual arrangement, since taxpayer-funded congressional travel usually involves a bipartisan delegation. (King did not respond to interview requests from The New Republic.)\n\nKing provided updates from small towns along the Serbia-Croatia border via his Twitter feed. \u201c6000 migrants/day transit through here at Adasevci, Serbia. From as far as Pakistan, mostly young Muslim males,\u201d King wrote. From Sid, Serbia, he shared another observation: \u201ctrains bound 4 Croatia-Slovenia-Austria then Germany. 1000 people per train. 6 trains per day. No end.\u201d He praised the fence along Hungary\u2019s borders with Croatia and Serbia for keeping refugees at bay. Europe was committing \u201ccultural suicide\u201d by admitting so many Muslim refugees, King told The New York Times, and he worried that President Obama was encouraging a similar decline in the United States. \u201cThe president is determined to import to America hundreds of thousands of displaced persons who will never assimilate into the American civilization.\u201d\n\nMembers of Austria\u2019s far-right Freedom Party attended a gathering in Trump Tower. \u201cThings are changing,\u201d the party\u2019s general secretary said. \u201cAnd we get to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nThe following year, in October 2016, King once again traveled alone on an official congressional trip to forge new ties with nationalist leaders\u2014this time to France, Finland, and Austria. In Vienna, King met with members of the far right, Putin-backed Freedom Party, which is hostile to Islam and the influx of refugees into Austria, and which secured a place in Austria\u2019s coalition government in 2017. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of a friendship,\u201d King told Freedom Party leader Norbert Hofer in a video posted on the party\u2019s web site.\n\nAbout a week before the presidential election, a delegation of Freedom Party officials visited New York, Washington, and North Carolina to meet with supporters. They spent time with General Mike Flynn, then Trump\u2019s national security adviser, in Trump Tower\u2014a meeting arranged by King, according to The Wall Street Journal. In Charlotte, North Carolina, Republican Representative Robert Pittenger hosted the politicians and said he had known them for years from meetings in the United States and Europe. In Washington, the Austrians met with supporters they knew from earlier gatherings, including the National Prayer Breakfast and CPAC, according to the Journal. Finally, the Austrians witnessed Trump\u2019s presidential victory at an election night party in Trump Tower. \u201cThings are changing,\u201d Harald Vilimsky, the Freedom Party\u2019s general secretary, wrote on Facebook that day. \u201cAnd we get to be a part of it. What an honor.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s election may have accelerated the transformation of America\u2019s foreign policy. But just as right-wing lawmakers like Rohrabacher and King had spent years cultivating relationships with like-minded leaders across the Atlantic, so too had nationalist politicians in Europe worked diligently to make inroads in America. In 2008, still stinging from the Bush administration\u2019s rebuke, Viktor Orb\u00e1n began plotting his return to power in Hungary. To help him, he hired Arthur J. Finkelstein, the reclusive American political strategist who was an early mastermind of red-meat Republican attack ads, as a political consultant for his Fidesz party.\n\nFinkelstein, who died in 2017, made his reputation as a major campaign player on the right by successfully recasting the word \u201cliberal\u201d as a pejorative in U.S. politics\u2014and through his counsel to clients that a winning strategy was to \u201cpolarize the electorate.\u201d Over the decades, he advised the campaigns of Ronald Reagan, Jesse Helms, Orrin Hatch, and many other Republicans, as well as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu; his many prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, known as \u201cArthur\u2019s kids,\u201d include recently indicted Trump adviser Roger Stone and Trump campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio. In 2011, in a rare public appearance at the CEVRO Institute, a university in Prague, Finkelstein predicted that voters, provoked by cataclysmic world events, would become increasingly drawn to xenophobia and nationalism. This combustible realignment of political views, Finkelstein explained, would translate into a resurgent longing for strongman leaders throughout the world, short on specific policy proposals, but long on authoritarian swagger. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anybody is watching Donald Trump in the United States, but it\u2019s mind-boggling, it\u2019s just pure personality,\u201d Finkelstein said, presciently.\n\nIn his work for Orb\u00e1n, Finkelstein took his signature strategy of political polarization and masterminded a campaign that cast Hungary as a victim suffering at the hands of the United States, the United Nations, and other purveyors of Western liberal democracy. Finkelstein was, according to Politico, behind the anti-immigration billboards that have proliferated in Hungary over the past decade. Thanks at least in part to Finkelstein\u2019s strategy, Orb\u00e1n won his reelection bid in 2010. After winning reelection again in 2014, Orb\u00e1n openly declared his intention to make Hungary an \u201cilliberal democracy.\u201d\n\nMarion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen addresses the Republican crowd at CPAC in February 2018. Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call/Getty\n\nRather than court the American diplomatic establishment, which was openly critical of him, the Hungarian prime minister turned to a more pliable institution: K Street. In October 2014, his government signed a contract with Connie Mack IV, a Republican congressman-turned-lobbyist from Florida who served four terms in the House before losing a bid for the Senate in 2012. Mack was one of the founding members of the House\u2019s hard-line Freedom Caucus and served on the Foreign Affairs Committee. He had hired Finkelstein as a consultant on his campaigns and described him as \u201ca friend\u201d to whom he often turned for advice.\n\nMack\u2019s contract with the Hungarian government catapulted him into the top ranks of the revolving-door profiteers on K Street. In 2015, he was one of the five most highly paid foreign agents in Washington, pulling in more than a million dollars from his lobbying work for Orb\u00e1n, according to an analysis by Politico of filings under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. (Mack also did not respond to interview requests from The New Republic.)\n\nMack\u2019s job on behalf of Orb\u00e1n was to craft \u201cpolitical messages\u201d to deliver to the White House, Congress, and the media, in order to \u201chave an influence on political decision making,\u201d according to his contract, obtained through a review of his FARA filings. J.D. Gordon, a former Pentagon spokesman who himself went on to develop relationships with powerful Hungarians and promote Trump\u2019s burgeoning ties with Budapest as a national security adviser to the 2016 Trump campaign, described Mack to me as \u201ca very effective and influential ally.\u201d\n\nConnie Mack\u2019s contract with Orb\u00e1n paid him more than a million dollars in 2015 \u2014catapulting him into the top ranks of the revolving-door profiteers on K Street.\n\nAccording to disclosures Mack filed with the U.S. government, he maintains regular contact with members of Congress and their staffs, as well as with conservative think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation. He also has ongoing contact with the Trump White House. He has communicated with Vice President Mike Pence, National Security Adviser John Bolton, and, before he resigned in August 2017, White House adviser Sebastian Gorka, a native Hungarian with far-right ties. Mack also distributes a newsletter, \u201cHungary Insights,\u201d which includes frequent reminders of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s early support for Trump and roundups of positive news reports about Orb\u00e1n, such as coverage of his friendly relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (though Mack makes scant reference in this p.r. offensive to Orb\u00e1n\u2019s condemnation by human rights advocates for fomenting anti-Semitism).\n\nOn the day of another Rohrabacher hearing on mass migration in Europe, in April 2018, Mack sent Rohrabacher a packet of materials that included a letter from the new Hungarian ambassador to the United States, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szab\u00f3, arguing that \u201cpublic sentiment in Europe is largely on Hungary\u2019s side\u201d on the issue of migration. Rohrabacher entered the document into the congressional record.\n\nIn a November 2017 appearance on Blunt Force Truth, a podcast hosted by former Love Connection host Chuck Woolery, now a conservative celebrity, Mack explained his support for Orb\u00e1n. He is \u201ca conservative,\u201d Mack said. \u201cI wish that our State Department would treat him more like a friend and an ally instead of some of these underlings attacking him for things that George Soros is making up.\u201d\n\nSoros, the Hungarian-born philanthropist who has spent hundreds of millions of dollars promoting civil society and liberal democracy in Eastern Europe over the past three decades, has become a b\u00eate noire for Republicans and for far-right extremists; last fall, a Trump supporter from Florida allegedly mailed a pipe bomb to Soros\u2019s home. (Type Investigations, the journalism nonprofit that is an editorial partner on this story, has received support from the Open Society Foundations, which Soros founded.) In Mack\u2019s framing, therefore, Orb\u00e1n was not an illiberal autocrat who abused human rights and destroyed democratic institutions, but rather a crusader for Western civilization whom the global left was unfairly demonizing. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s goal in working with Washington insiders was to get \u201cthe foreign policy world that could make life miserable for Hungary to think that he was just an ordinary conservative government\u2014a garden-variety conservative state besieged by liberals,\u201d said Kim Lane Scheppele, a Hungary expert at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton.\n\nOther nationalist politicians in Europe have employed a similar strategy. A 2017 investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, a transnational consortium of investigative journalists that is partially funded by the Open Society Foundations, found that between 2015 and 2017, the far-right VMRO party in Macedonia engaged in a concerted lobbying campaign in Washington, which \u201cprompted U.S. conservatives to join in on an anti-Soros line of attack favored by Russia and Europe\u2019s authoritarian nationalists.\u201d\n\nThe Obama State Department had condemned the \u201cinflammatory rhetoric\u201d of some Macedonian politicians, which \u201cgives license to attacks on democratic institutions.\u201d Three days before Trump\u2019s inauguration, however, Senator Mike Lee, the influential Republican of Utah, who chairs the Senate Steering Committee, the powerful caucus of the chamber\u2019s conservatives, wrote an angry letter to Jess Baily, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, criticizing America\u2019s meddling. \u201cI have received credible reports that, over the past few years, the U.S. Mission to Macedonia has actively intervened in the party politics of Macedonia, as well as in the shaping of its media environment and civil society, often favoring groups of one political persuasion over another,\u201d Lee wrote. This, the senator argued, was \u201chighly problematic.\u201d (In contrast, Lee has sought to wave away Russian interference in the 2016 election, arguing that the Mueller probe is unconstitutional. He also blocked a Senate resolution to protect Mueller\u2019s investigation against interference by Trump.)\n\nHungarian Ambassador R\u00e9ka Szemerk\u00e9nyi socialized with Trump and the first lady at an event at Mar-a-Lago in February 2017. R\u00e9ka Szemerk\u00e9nyi\n\nTwo months later, Lee followed up with another letter to then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, specifically attacking Soros-funded programs that \u201cpush a progressive agenda and invigorate the political left.\u201d Lee, along with five Republican Senate colleagues\u2014James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, David Perdue of Georgia, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, and Ted Cruz\u2014demanded an investigation into \u201call funds associated with promoting democracy and governance.\u201d The language of the letter echoed that of a pamphlet distributed on Capitol Hill by a VMRO-backed Macedonian group called Stop Operation Soros.\n\nWhen countries \u201care getting in trouble on human rights, rule of law, the governance direction of the country,\u201d said Heather Conley, who served in the George W. Bush State Department, they \u201cflood Washington with funding\u201d to lobbyists and think tanks to soften the story or make it go away. According to the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project report, for example, Macedonia\u2019s VMRO party spent more than a million dollars on lobbyists and p.r. firms between 2015 and 2017. \u201cInstead of us fixing the problem,\u201d Conley said, \u201cthey fix us.\u201d\n\nA high-profile example of this dynamic is the now-infamous lobbying contract that Paul Manafort signed with Ukraine\u2019s strongman president, Viktor Yanukovych, in 2013. Yanukovych enlisted Manafort to mount a charm offensive on his behalf; from 2012 to 2014, according to the Associated Press, Manafort helped steer at least $2.2 million to two Washington lobbying firms. In a memo to Yanukovych in February 2013, buried in a court filing in his criminal tax fraud case, Manafort argued that changes in the composition of the U.S. Congress created an opportunity to \u201cexpand relationships, open minds, and demonstrate to the global community that Ukraine is a modern democracy.\u201d\n\nIn particular, Manafort noted, Yanukovych had a dependable ally who had just been installed by the House leadership in a powerful position: Dana Rohrabacher, then the new chair of the Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Rohrabacher, Manafort assured his client, is \u201ca good appointment for Ukraine and will be open minded about key policy issues.\u201d In contrast, Manafort noted, the Human Rights and Democracy Subcommittee will \u201cseek to pressure the VY Government.\u201d Therefore, Manafort wrote, \u201cthe best block of its actions is to have the pertinent SubCommittee on Europe take more positive stands. This is the strategy we are building.\u201d\n\nBy the time Trump was elected president, the trope that conservatives were under assault by left-wing elites, as epitomized by George Soros and the Obama administration, was an article of faith in the GOP. Indeed, an infamous Trump TV spot aired widely during the last week of the campaign featured an image of Soros as a sinister, unaccountable funder of globalist interests who was seeking to sway the election on Hillary Clinton\u2019s behalf. In April 2017, at a Heritage Foundation event, Mike Lee argued that under Obama, U.S. diplomacy \u201ctook a decidedly leftist turn,\u201d taking up the \u201cpet causes of a privileged global elite\u201d such as abortion and \u201calternative family structures\u201d\u2014a reference to the Obama administration\u2019s support for LGBT rights. Lee mocked American efforts to bolster embattled civic institutions in fledgling democracies as \u201cthe substance of a global re-education campaign, funded by American taxpayers, from whom they were hidden under the guise of innocuous sounding program titles like \u2018democracy assistance,\u2019 \u2018government transparency,\u2019 and \u2018human-rights.\u2019\u201d\n\nMainstream conservative media outlets echoed and amplified Lee\u2019s views. That spring, the American Spectator published a series of laudatory articles on Macedonia\u2019s far right, as did other conservative outlets, including Fox News, Breitbart, and The Daily Caller\u2014as well as Russian state media outlets RT and Sputnik. In one article, the Spectator described \u201csmall but mighty Macedonia\u201d as \u201cthe mouse that roared this year, declaring war on George Soros . . . and his U.S. Government handmaidens, who, incredibly, have financed a left-wing agenda to divide the nation and bring a socialist-Muslim coalition to power.\u201d\n\nIn February 2017, the Conservative Political Action Conference welcomed in its exhibit hall the Europe of Nations and Freedom, a coalition of far-right political parties in the European Parliament, including Austria\u2019s Freedom Party, France\u2019s National Front, and the Netherlands\u2019s Party for Freedom. A coalition representative told me that he hoped their attendance at America\u2019s premier conservative gathering would lead to \u201charmonized cooperation between the United States and Europe.\u201d\n\nThe following year, CPAC featured a speech that won wide acclaim from the event\u2019s activist Republican audience, by a woman billed as a supporter of \u201cschool choice, private property, lower taxes, less government spending, market competition, and traditional marriage.\u201d This was Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen, the granddaughter of National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, a notorious Holocaust denier. In her nationalistic remarks, Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen embraced Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d rhetoric and anti-immigration policies, and decried \u201cthe development of an Islamic counter-society in France.\u201d She criticized the European Union, calling it \u201can ideology without land, without people, without roots, and without civilization,\u201d and warned that France was \u201cpassing from the eldest daughter of the Catholic Church to the little niece of Islam.\u201d To the assembled Republicans, she vowed, \u201cThis is not the France that our grandparents fought for. . . . Just like you, we want our country back.\u201d Over the course of her ten-minute address, the CPAC crowd clapped, cheered, and cried \u201cVive la France!\u201d Slowly but surely, the extreme nativist views that just a few years earlier had occupied the outer reaches of the Republican fringe had become firmly ensconced in the mainstream.\n\nIn years past, seasoned diplomats and career government officials might have been able to use America\u2019s political and economic influence to pressure European autocrats to conform to an American worldview that, however inconsistently applied, included lifting up democratic values and institutions. But Trump has hollowed out the State Department. The president has yet to name a nominee to 37 senior State posts, 38 of his department nominees still await Senate confirmation, and he has yet to name replacements for more than a dozen others. Early in his tenure, Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s first secretary of state, signaled to his employees at State that promoting human rights and democracy abroad could often create an \u201cobstacle\u201d to advancing U.S. interests.\n\nIt is in fact the Trump administration\u2019s view that America\u2019s interests are aligned with the likes of autocrats like Viktor Orb\u00e1n. R\u00e9ka Szemerk\u00e9nyi, who served as Hungary\u2019s ambassador to the United States until July 2017, was in frequent contact with Trump campaign and administration officials\u2014even mingling with the president and first lady at Mar-a-Lago. In the fall of 2016, Trump campaign adviser Carter Page traveled to Budapest at Szemerk\u00e9nyi\u2019s behest, he later told congressional investigators, for a private meeting with Jeno Megyesy, a top Orb\u00e1n adviser. Jeff Sessions also met with Szemerk\u00e9nyi in April 2016 and later sent her a letter, which has not been previously reported, praising Hungary as \u201ca global beacon for the power of freedom, democracy, and human rights.\u201d In December 2016, Trump campaign adviser J.D. Gordon also traveled to Budapest, where he delivered a speech at the Antall J\u00f3zsef Knowledge Center, a local think tank. \u201cWe very much admire and respect Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n and what he is doing to make Hungary great again,\u201d Gordon said, according to the Budapest Business Journal. \u201cHe is one of the best world leaders, in my opinion, because he has common sense and he understands the threats from open borders.\u201d Trump and Orb\u00e1n, Gordon predicted, \u201cwill be good friends.\u201d\n\nMarion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen\u2019s nationalistic speech at CPAC won wide acclaim from the Republicans in attendance, who clapped, cheered, and cried \u201cVive la France!\u201d\n\nIn the absence of pressure from the U.S. foreign policy establishment, Europe\u2019s far-right regimes have become emboldened. In June 2018, for example, the Hungarian Parliament passed a law that criminalizes aid to refugees and migrants. Human Rights Watch condemned the measure as an attempt to silence critics and block the work of NGOs attempting to aid asylum seekers. But neither the White House nor the State Department raised any criticism, and both have called for stronger U.S.-Hungarian ties. The following month, the State Department canceled a program intended to support media outlets engaged in fact-based reporting in Hungary. The Obama administration had invited organizations to apply for $700,000 in funding that would go toward training journalists, expanding their audiences, and increasing the public\u2019s access to \u201creliable and unbiased information.\u201d Connie Mack and pro-Orb\u00e1n Republicans in Congress, however, including Rohrabacher and Maryland\u2019s Andy Harris, the co-chair of the Hungarian American Congressional Caucus, demanded that the government ax the program.\n\nThe Trump administration has continued to close ranks behind Orb\u00e1n. In November, after meeting with the prime minister in Budapest, Energy Secretary Rick Perry tweeted a photograph of the pair in a warm handshake, saying he hoped it \u201ccan mark the beginning of an even closer relationship between the U.S. & Hungary.\u201d The meeting was not covered in the U.S. press. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s office boasted that \u201cHungarian-U.S. relations are excellent,\u201d and noted that the two countries \u201cconfirmed that historical traditions and Christian roots must also play an important role in modern governance.\u201d\n\nEven though the Democrats regained control of the House last November, the reversal of party control in one chamber will not produce any swift pushback to this rising autocratic tide. Trump has used the prerogatives of the executive branch to nearly obliterate U.S. censure of anti-democratic regimes. What\u2019s more, the strongman caucus is continuing to accrue power on the GOP side of the aisle. Dana Rohrabacher may be gone, but many other influential members of the party\u2019s far-right flank remain in office, including Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Andy Harris, Steve King, and Louie Gohmert.\n\nNationalist orthodoxy within the Republican Party has gained additional ground as more moderate voices on foreign policy, like Ed Royce of California, who long chaired the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Bob Corker, the former chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have retired, leaving their party to more extreme factions. In November, Tennessee voters elected longtime Representative Marsha Blackburn to fill Corker\u2019s seat. In 2017, Blackburn, along with King and other Republicans, met with Heinz-Christian Strache and other members of Austria\u2019s Freedom Party.\n\nMoreover, conservative think tanks like the Heritage Foundation, activist groups like Judicial Watch, and conservative media outlets like Fox News and Breitbart have created a powerful opinion echo chamber that reinforces the nationalist and xenophobic positions of the autocratic right. By cheering the GOP\u2019s embrace of autocrats\u2014and packaging it in familiar conspiracy theories that cast Soros and other liberal donors as shadowy puppet-masters plotting against well-meaning, patriotic conservatives\u2014they have helped convince the Republican base of the acceptability of these far-right ideas. A \u201cRepublican phalanx\u201d has effectively dislodged Washington\u2019s longstanding bipartisan foreign policy consensus around democracy promotion, said Scheppele, to the point that \u201cyou can\u2019t take that for granted anymore.\u201d\n\nThis is why future administrations will have a hard time stemming the ominous global advance of right-wing strongmen. Right-wing lawmakers, lobbyists, consultants, media outlets, and think tanks have worked for years to foment the Republican base\u2019s opposition to \u201cglobal elites.\u201d Trump helped stoke that same anger, and won the presidency as a result. But in truth, the most significant change is not Trump\u2019s ascension; it\u2019s something much larger and more unsettling. Today\u2019s conservative leaders\u2014the voices who now make up the strongman caucus\u2014have come of age under the conviction that U.S. policies supporting democracy, human rights, and a free press abroad are all essentially equivalent to their domestic enemy\u2014liberalism\u2014and therefore must be destroyed.\n\nAdditional research was done by Julia Herrnb\u00f6ck and Jaime Longoria."

      "Josephine Livingstone"
    ],
    "text": "When you take into account the way the fine dining industry overlaps with home cooking and food media, the overall effect is of a culture that skews male, white, and wealthy. Foodie-ism, in this country, is largely created by white people for white people. As Korsha Wilson noted in a widely shared Eater piece on dining while black, fancy restaurants are often hospitable only to the white and affluent: \u201cAs many black diners know, being in a dining space can often mean choosing between being ignored, interrogated, or assaulted.\u201d\n\nEven attempts to diversify foodie culture contain a pernicious brand of exoticism. The writer and artist Sukjong Hong (who is also a former staffer at The New Republic) put it to me this way: She loves food and cooks often for her family, but sees foodie-ism as \u201ca form of conspicuous consumption that disguises itself as cultural acumen.\u201d When food is separated out from its practical function and cultural context and turned into a media property, foodie-ism is often \u201corientalist and neocolonial in its language of \u2018discovery,\u2019\u201d Hong said, particularly in its \u201cvaluing of authenticity around foods that are not from the dominant culture.\u201d It is how miso and soy sauce, everyday staples in Asian cuisine, become the province of experts.\n\nI recently tagged along with a food critic to a restaurant she was planning to review (she asked to remain anonymous for professional reasons). Between bites of a sandwich that I would struggle to describe to you (I am allergic to the dominant tropes of food writing: the \u201cthrumming bass line\u201d of spice in a dish, endless and labored synonyms for \u201ccrispy,\u201d etc; the sandwich was good) I put my questions about the problem with foodie-ism to her. My acquaintance is a white woman, and she noted that there are lots of people who look like her at the top of food publications. White women are socialized to cook at home, but also made to feel (more) welcome in a prestige office environment.\n\n\n\nA fancy restaurant critic, on the other hand, gets his expertise through sheer volume of experience, trekking across the fine dining institutions of the world. That takes money, unless you have a reliable expense account. It might also take a certain skin color: She cited Wilson\u2019s piece about her experience at the Grill in Manhattan, where a bartender assumed she\u2019d never tried a negroni before and condescendingly explained to her the principle of bitter flavor profiles.\n\nOn the face of it, we were discussing the kinds of bias that shape every American industry. Race, class, and gender inflect everybody\u2019s experience of life, in and out of the workplace. But only the most coddled of our society get to build a career in restaurant criticism, which remains the ultimate arbiter of what sophisticated eaters value in their food. Meanwhile, line cooks in fancy restaurants and diner chains continue to make roughly the same wages.\n\nAll our discussions about food are shot through with these fundamental inequities. Take a recent GQ profile of Tunde Wey, written by Brett Martin. Wey makes delicious food, but his work is also a form of political performance art: in Martin\u2019s words, \u201ca hybrid of political action ... revolutionary rhetoric, impish provocation, and other assorted acts of public intellectualism, all built around a critique of the way we eat in America today.\u201d Wey melds cookery with a potent critique of gentrification and racial inequality. For example, in 2018 he hosted an event called Hot Chicken Shit in Nashville, where he charged white diners $1,000 for four pieces of chicken, or a Nashville property deed for a whole chicken. Black diners ate for free.\n\nMartin, however, openly has trouble with Wey\u2019s approach and worldview. He describes the \u201cpain and frustration\u201d he felt when Wey took him to task for fawning over a white southern chef. On another occasion, Martin accuses Wey of \u201chating food,\u201d positing that his \u201cindignation at foodie culture was, at least in part, a puffed-up justification for what was really a deep ambivalence about pleasure.\u201d This is an old chestnut in conversations around food: the idea that physical pleasure is a neutral, apolitical sensation. Wey responded that he loved to eat and that of course \u201cthere should be places where dining is simple pleasure, where food is respite and solace.\u201d But the problem is that everywhere is like that: \u201cif all your spaces are spaces where you eat and don\u2019t think about shit, then you\u2019re never thinking about shit!\u201d\n\nIt is curious that the commercialization of foodie-ism surged in the wake of the financial crash of 2008. Instead of leading to a more frugal eating culture, precarity has resulted in a proliferation of the luxury restaurants that have come to symbolize our Gilded Age. Look no further than the new Hudson Yards complex in New York, which will feature 25 separate places to eat over the course of a few city blocks, including new ventures from superstar chefs like Thomas Keller and David Chang.\n\nStill, the recession did have an impact. \u201cThe financial crash changed everything in the restaurant space,\u201d Amiel Stanek, an editor at Bon Appetit, told me. The recession, he said, \u201csaw the end of a certain kind of fine dining: finance-bro, expense-account kind of restaurant. We saw the rise of fine casual, with places like gastropubs, and a new focus on certain kinds of cuisine that were not \u2018Frenchy\u2019 or Japanese. You saw a lot of regional Italian food, which felt homey and safe to people, and a lot of British food, interestingly.\u201d\n\nThe vibe in America post-crash, Stanek said, was \u201cone of nervousness around ostentatious displays of wealth. Restaurants started capitalizing on shows of austerity.\u201d This helps explain the rise in nose-to-tail and farm-to-table eating. Diners were spending the same amount as in the old white-tablecloth spots, but the sensibility had changed. In the meat world, for example, \u201coff-cuts became really popular,\u201d Stanek noted. \u201cYou suddenly saw hanger steak on every menu, you saw short rib on every menu, you saw pork belly on every menu.\u201d When filet mignon and rib-eye started to feel distastefully extravagant, hanger steak took off. And now it\u2019s expensive, because consumers want to identify with it.\n\nNose-to-tail and farm-to-table became key market principles in recession food culture, part of a \u201cfantasy of rustic or peasant-style cooking,\u201d in Stanek\u2019s words. As Americans rejected excess they embraced a new ethos of authenticity. \u201cWhether a place was really making authentic Sicilian food, or authentic Roman food, or was being true to some kind of farm-to-table ethos, the appearance of a vision became more important,\u201d Stanek said.\n\nMuch of millennial consumer culture is about our instinctive sense of precarity, our allergy to corporate signifiers, and our formless urge to be good people who won\u2019t screw up the world all over again. But the food market adapted, of course, and continued to take our money, though selling us different values. Transparency, authenticity, good health, convenience, anti-snobbery\u2014all now available at Sweetgreen!\n\nThis is all a lot to hold in one\u2019s head every time one orders a meal. As The New Yorker\u2019s food writer Helen Rosner told me, we make decisions about food several times a day. So, no matter how much we know about how we should eat, our knowledge about food always exists in tension with learned habits in our daily behavior. Philosophers call this gap between knowing and doing the \u201cmalaise of will,\u201d Rosner explained. Food is so close to the grain of our lives that we eat on unconscious instinct, which is often just another word for bias.\n\n\n\nWithout a doubt, food has become newly political. The difficulty of defining that politics, however, lies in the fact that food culture is precisely coextensive with human culture. Food is virtually synonymous with life. We all need to eat, and when we stop to consider our eating habits we are really pondering a galaxy of concerns that seem all out of proportion with, say, the desire to eat a croissant. When a behavior happens constantly, it can be almost impossible to gain the Archimedean point necessary to see it clearly.\n\nBut just as Betty Friedan took ordinary life as her subject in The Feminine Mystique, to show that the \u201cnormal\u201d is political, the many ways that social politics inheres in food culture prove that point all over again. What has felt like a special interest subject is, in fact, everybody\u2019s business."

    "text": "This language doesn\u2019t even bother to exonerate Trump\u2019s associate Roger Stone, who during the campaign was in cahoots with WikiLeaks as it dumped Russian-hacked emails that damaged Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Barr\u2019s statements only pertain to the Russian government, not Russian individuals or WikiLeaks or anyone else. This is a crucial distinction, given that we know the Trump campaign knew of and encouraged Stone\u2019s coordination with WikiLeaks.\n\nIn his testimony to Congress, Cohen revealed that Stone called Trump around July 19, 2016, to tell him about the upcoming WikiLeaks dump. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be nice,\u201d Cohen describes Trump responding. After the July 22 release of the emails, \u201ca senior Trump Campaign official was directed,\u201d Stone\u2019s indictment describes, without saying who did the directing, \u201cto contact STONE about any additional releases and what other damaging information\u201d WikiLeaks had on the Clinton campaign. In October 2016, WikiLeaks released emails stolen from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, deflecting attention away from a damning video showing Trump making sexually abusive comments; in response, \u201can associate of [a] high-ranking Trump Campaign official sent a text message to STONE that read \u2018well done,\u2019\u201d the indictment says.\n\nMore importantly, Barr\u2019s letter doesn\u2019t address something else Mueller investigated: whether a series of exchanges between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russians amounted to a crime. The sworn testimony of Trump\u2019s aides reveal that, at least through June 2016, he continued to pursue a $300 million real estate deal in Moscow that required Vladimir Putin\u2019s assistance. While hoping to land that deal, Trump\u2019s son, Don Jr., took a meeting with some Russians offering dirt on Clinton as \u201cpart of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump.\u201d At the end of the meeting, Don Jr. said his father would consider sanctions relief for Russia if he won.\n\nThen, on August 2, 2016, in the same meeting where Manafort gave Kilimnik polling data, he discussed a \u201cpeace\u201d deal in Ukraine that would also amount to sanctions relief for the Russians. Finally, after he was elected but before he was president, Trump undercut President Obama\u2019s response to the Russian hacks, suggesting that he would give Russia sanctions relief.\n\nThe hack-and-leak is not the crime Trump may have committed. It is, instead, a quid pro quo deal by which Russia would help Trump win and Trump would relieve Russia of the sanctions imposed for engaging in human rights violations, annexing Crimea, and hacking the election to help Trump win.\n\nIn deciding that Trump didn\u2019t obstruct justice after a paltry 48 hours of review, Barr \u201cconcluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\u201d He came to this conclusion\u2014in spite of saying during his confirmation hearings that what Trump is known to have done amounts to obstruction\u2014because Mueller found that \u201cthe evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not the crime that, the evidence quite clearly shows, Trump may have committed. This is not the crime that Manafort appears to have lied about in hopes of getting a pardon.\n\nIn giving Trump the all-clear on obstruction charges, Barr appears not to have considered whether Trump obstructed the actual crime in question. He instead considered whether the president obstructed a different crime. This is the legal sleight of hand that has allowed Barr to proclaim that Trump will not be charged.\n\nThe Democratic-controlled House Judiciary Committee now has abundant reason to get all the underlying materials from the Mueller inquiry, because the attorney general just cleared the president of something he agreed constituted a crime just a few months ago."

    "text": "Indeed, that flattening is taken by National Review as a reflection of each state\u2019s true nature. The Electoral College, the magazine wrote, \u201cguarantees that candidates who seek the only nationally elected office in America must attempt to appeal to as broad a geographic constituency as possible\u2014large states and small, populous and rural\u2014rather than retreating to their preferred pockets and running up the score.\u201d But the Electoral College stifles the country\u2019s diversity instead of nourishing it. The average Floridian\u2019s vote is currently far more influential than that of a Republican in D.C. or a Democrat in Utah. Without the Electoral College, they would all matter equally.\n\nDefenders also raise the bizarre specter of a systemic breakdown without the Electoral College. \u201cThe freak occurrence that was Bush v. Gore is often raised as an objection against the status quo,\u201d National Review argued. \u201cLess attention is paid to the obvious question: What if that recount had been national?\u201d So does the Journal: \u201cThe uncertainty arising from a nationwide recount for President amid myriad regional irregularities\u2014as happened in North Carolina and Florida in 2018\u2014would make Florida 2000 look tame.\u201d It\u2019s unclear why a nationwide recount would happen if something went awry, since states and counties would presumably still run the actual voting process.\n\nThe most common defense of the Electoral College is also its greatest weakness: that it sometimes elects a president who didn\u2019t receive the most votes. \u201cLike the Supreme Court, the Electoral College sometimes frustrates the will of political majorities,\u201d the Journal reminds us. \u201cThat makes it an easy target in this populist age. But while \u2018majority rules\u2019 has always been an appealing slogan, it\u2019s an insufficient principle for structuring an electoral system in the U.S.\u201d This is a baffling comparison. Yes, the Supreme Court is supposed to stand slightly apart from Americans\u2019 fleeting whims. That\u2019s the purpose of an independent judiciary. But elections, by definition, are supposed to reflect the people\u2019s whims, to give them force and verve and corporeality, to translate the potential into the real. At its best, the Electoral College doesn\u2019t stop the popular vote from doing that, and at its worse, it actively prevents that. Too much majoritarianism can be a bad thing, of course. But not enough of it can be far worse.\n\nIt\u2019s a little rich for conservatives to denounce abolishing the filibuster or the Electoral College as a bridge too far when Republicans have championed their own set of structural reforms. The party\u2019s 2016 platform calls for constitutional amendments that would impose term limits on federal lawmakers, require Congress to pass a balanced budget, allow states to ban same-sex marriages, and require new federal regulations to be approved by a majority of both houses of Congress\u2014a mini-revolution for American governance, if it became reality. Over the last decade, almost three dozen Republican-led state legislatures have even quietly passed motions to call for a \u201cconvention of the states\u201d to propose amendments without Congress\u2019 approval. That\u2019s a far more dramatic step than any Democratic proposal currently up for discussion.\n\n\n\nSo why reform the system now? Most of the Democrats\u2019 proposals have been floating around for years. The country came closest to scrapping the Electoral College in the 1970s when Congress almost passed a constitutional amendment to end it. But there\u2019s heightened urgency. Trump\u2019s presidency has been extraordinarily good at exposing flaws and weaknesses in American democracy. And his effect on the public debate won\u2019t end when he leaves office because the even greater threat of climate change looms over the horizon. Democrats can no longer afford to spend the next decade trying to convince Republicans to support even the most meager plans to decarbonize the American economy.\n\nNational Review\u2019s David French correctly attributes some of this reformist energy to Twitter, where activists on both sides have a disproportionate ability to shape the public debate. \u201cThe people who care the most about anything\u2014from politics to sports to pop culture\u2014set the tone,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd in American politics, the people who care the most tend not to be moderate, either in temperament or ideology. By the time progressive Twitter has done its work on the Democratic field, the American people may no longer have the ability to choose true American norms in 2020.\u201d\n\nBut, as he admits, presidential primaries are always boundary-testing moments. Conservatives know this all too well: The Republicans\u2019 current standard-bearer won the 2016 primaries by calling for a wall along the nation\u2019s southern border, demanding mass deportations across the country, and proposing a Muslim ban. Now all three positions are GOP orthodoxy. Is scrapping the Electoral College or the filibuster truly more extreme than any of those demands?\n\nAnd with the unfortunate exception of court-packing, these proposals aren\u2019t about revenge for the Trump era or furthering the vicious cycle of partisan warfare. If anything, they\u2019re about breaking the cycle. Each of the other proposals will enhance popular representation in American democracy. So if Democrats benefit from eliminating the Electoral College, gerrymandering, and the filibuster, and enacting meaningful campaign-finance reform, it will only be because their proposals tend to be more in line with the American public as a whole.\n\n\n\nThis may be why some conservatives are so worried about this debate. They aren\u2019t actually afraid of an unfair system where a Chairman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will impose communism on America. They\u2019re afraid of a fair system where voters will have an opportunity to decisively reject their views.\n\n"

    ],
    "text": "Muller left Moscow permanently in 1937, and won the Nobel Prize in 1946. Deeply offended by Lysenkoism, he threw himself into the work of an anti-totalitarian activist. When a Cultural and Scientific Congress for World Peace was held in New York City in 1949, featuring Soviet delegates and a message of peaceful coexistence with the USSR, anti-Communists were incensed with the lack of criticism of the Soviet system. Muller appeared at a counter-conference, speaking about the \u201cDestruction of Science in the USSR,\u201d and arguing that \u201cThe Communist Party regards as a menace any concept that does not fit patly into its scheme for mankind.\u201d\n\nThe CIA took an interest in the protest, and backed an elaborate response to the \u201cPeace\u201d activism that had become one of the key features of Soviet post-war propaganda campaigns. Muller gave the second paper at the inaugural session of the Congress for Cultural Freedom in Berlin in 1950. He warned of the threat to science from despotism \u201cmasquerading under the name of \u2018national socialism\u2019 or \u2018international communism\u2019\u201d and he defended the \u201cright to think differently, to question, and to express our disagreements.\u201d The CIA financed the Congress for Cultural Freedom so that it grew into a globe-spanning network that published books and magazines and held exhibitions and conferences. The CCF became the centerpiece of the CIA\u2019s attempt to create a hospitable place for intellectual anti-Communism.\n\nThough best known for its work with artists and writers, the CCF also maintained a science program. (The journal Minerva, which still exists, began as a publication of the CCF in 1962.) The CCF sponsored a major conference in 1953, bringing more than 100 scientists to Hamburg to raise awareness of the mistreatment of scholars under totalitarianism. It started a Committee on Science and Freedom in 1954. But the layers of financial and managerial misdirection required to maintain a front organization also meant that its effects could sometimes be oblique to U.S. security goals.\n\nThe first publication on scientific matters that the CCF supported was called Science and Freedom. But while CCF headquarters in Paris hoped that the journal would continue to cover issues of totalitarianism, its new editor George Polanyi had other ideas. At first glance, he had seemed the ideal candidate. He was the son of the chemist Michael Polanyi, who was active in the CCF and a strong opponent of government planning in science. (Michael, in turn, was the brother of political economist and social democrat Karl Polanyi, with whom he had serious disagreements about Cold War politics. Even in the 1950s Karl warned his brother to disentangle himself \u201cfrom the parasites of the Cold War,\u201d and said that the CIA\u2019s involvement in shaping the idea of freedom was contrary to Michael\u2019s own commitment against government involvement in intellectual inquiry.)\n\n\n\nGeorge Polanyi (aided by his wife Priscilla, who did a good deal of the work for no compensation or recognition) mostly ignored attempts at guidance from the CCF secretariat. They sent material that he simply chose not to publish. Instead of focusing on the poor treatment of scientific workers under totalitarianism, he was more interested in exploring restrictions on academic freedom in the West, such as racial exclusion at the University of Alabama and apartheid at the University of Cape Town. He devoted little attention to conditions under Communism, and in 1960 even ran an article about Chinese universities that argued that academics might be better off under Mao than in many other countries, including non-Communist ones. Science and Freedom was soon enough done in and replaced by the more professional Minerva, but it is hard to see the magazine as having done much to advance U.S. hegemony.\n\nEven in the 1950s Karl Polanyi warned his brother that the CIA\u2019s involvement in shaping the idea of freedom was contrary to his own commitments.\n\nThe general portrait that Wolfe offers is of a scientific world thoroughly infiltrated by government interests but not necessarily in lock-step with government goals. Science attach\u00e9s were used for intelligence collection in the 1950s. The supposedly independent \u201cPugwash\u201d gatherings, where Soviets scientists gathered with their Western counterparts to discuss matters including the dangers of radioactive fallout, were initially seen by the CIA as Communist propaganda. But the American head of the Pugwash Continuing Committee, Eugene Rabinowitch (who was also editor of the widely distributed Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists), began cooperating with the U.S. government, which proceeded to use Pugwash meetings as opportunities for backchannel communications.\n\nAfter the Soviets\u2019 successful launch of Sputnik in 1958, there was a considerable effort to reform science curriculum in U.S. high schools. To meet the challenge posed by Soviet technology, the new curriculum sought to introduce scientific thinking as a \u201cway of knowing,\u201d not just a collection of facts. There were reforms made in physics and chemistry teaching, but it was in biology that a new approach was most widely adopted. There, the emphasis was on the evidence-based nature of science\u2014making Lysenko the absent foil.\n\nThe Asia Foundation, a CIA proprietary whose budget was considerably larger that of the CCF, wanted to help get those textbooks into classrooms around the world. By 1971 adaptations were under way in more than 35 countries; and the Asia Foundation was determined that these versions reflect local fauna and agricultural practices, for example, to avoid the appearance of cultural imperialism. When a textbook was pirated in Taiwan, the Asia Foundation tried to make sure that the directly copied version was not used. \u201cA CIA proprietary,\u201d writes Wolfe, \u201cbacked the book that looked less American on the theory that it would more effectively convey the US approach to science instruction.\u201d When, in the late 1960s, it was revealed that the Asia Foundation and the CCF were CIA fronts, the CCF revelations caused a scandal. By contrast, the news about the Asia Foundation (which still exists, now under the budgetary authority of the State Department) was met mostly with shrugs.\n\nGiven the relatively ineffective nature of much of this activity, some may feel a tug of nostalgia for a time when the CIA thought it worthwhile to sponsor nearly unread journals and textbooks promoting inquiry-based learning. Compared to the violence that the agency sponsored at the same time, these forays into science might seem harmless. Yet U.S. global power has also always depended on having certain features that were attractive to many people, and scientific internationalism might have been a part of that.\n\nIn 2019, it\u2019s perhaps easier to see how politicized science can be in the United States. In an epilogue to the book, Wolfe writes that Trump\u2019s attitude towards climate science reminds her of nothing so much as Lysenkoism. The mechanisms are not the same, of course, and the United States is institutionally pluralistic in a way that limits the repressive power of the state over scientists. Yet the consequences of official denial may still be grave. In a further irony, climate change denialism is a \u201cparty truth,\u201d associated with Republican elected officials. Scientists who have raised the alarm are accused of being part of a liberal plot to socialize America.\n\n\u201cParty truths\u201d were one of the ideas that Cold Warriors sought to defeat. There is no such thing as \u201cbourgeois science\u201d they would say: That is a totalitarian slur. There is only science. Their solution was \u201cfree\u201d science in a liberal democracy, but the equation of liberal democracy with free scientific inquiry has not turned out to be so simple. The dismissal of climate science as \u201cliberal science\u201d rather than just science, has not occurred under a totalitarian regime. That it has occurred under capitalism is by no means incidental, because much of the work to muddy the waters on the science has come from groups that stand to profit from fossil fuel extraction.\n\nIt is difficult to ignore how extensively capitalism shapes the nature of scientific production. Scientific research from agriculture to medicine is directed towards profitable potential discoveries, not those that would necessarily do the most social good. Furthermore, scientists during the Cold War and today face the reality that research possibilities are frequently linked to national security goals and through them, the defense of global inequalities. Carefully researched works on the Cultural Cold War, like Freedom\u2019s Laboratory, reveal what a murky world we have inherited. Scientists fighting against restrictions on their profession used the language of crusading anti-Communism, defining their work as apolitical and therefore free. But it was neither.\n\nThe point is not, as Wolfe argues clearly, that \u201cfreedom\u201d is an impossible value to hold, nor that scientific internationalism isn\u2019t worth defending, nor that the fiction of apolitical science means that science is better off being relentlessly politicized. The point, rather, is that power and knowledge are always entwined. During the Cold War, American institutions were assumed to be ideal by default. We now know more than enough to understand that they were not, and that the task of making them better belongs to us."

Why go to bat to try to end a government shutdown when you don\u2019t actually care if the government is shut down? Here\u2019s Homans on McConnell\u2019s answer to the question, \u201cWhat do you see as your role, the majority leader\u2019s role, in a time of crisis?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d McConnell replied, \u201cI think what I have to do, my goal, and depending upon what the numbers are, and what\u2019s achievable, is always to get as right-of-center an outcome as possible.\u201d He brought up the example of the Budget Control Act of 2011, which we had been discussing: a bill produced from a high-stakes negotiation between the White House and congressional Republicans, in which McConnell, breaking with newly elected Tea Party hard-liners in the House, played dealmaker, providing the Democrats with bipartisan cover for a necessary debt-limit increase while also securing cuts that Republicans had sought. \u201cI mean, at the risk of sounding like I\u2019m patting myself on the back, who would have ever thought with Barack Obama in the White House you could get something like the Budget Control Act in August of 2011, which actually drove down government spending for two years in a row?\u201d McConnell said. \u201cTo me, given the numbers, and if you prefer America right of center, that\u2019s my definition of success.\u201d I was startled not just by his frankness but by the type of crisis that McConnell\u2019s mind had gone to, which was not exactly the kind of worst-case scenario that was foremost on many minds during Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nThis is an extremely funny answer to anyone who remembers recent political history. The Budget Control Act of 2011 was a temporary compromise intended to use the threat of a future catastrophe to force a larger and more lasting compromise. Republicans in Congress had threatened to refuse to raise the debt ceiling\u2014once more holding the basic operations of government hostage\u2014unless the Obama administration acceded to their demands for economic austerity. At effectively the last moment before economic disaster, Republicans and the White House negotiated the Budget Control Act of 2011, which called for the creation of a bipartisan deficit-reduction \u201csupercommittee\u201d to propose a truly bipartisan austerity package within a few months. If Congress failed to pass it or a similar package, a series of automatic budget cuts would go into effect. These cuts were designed to be anathema to both parties\u2014mostly because they would target defense spending, in addition to outlays for social spending and income supports. The entire point was that everyone would be incentivized to get a huge bipartisan deficit-reduction bill passed.\n\n\n\nThe supercommittee gave up after a few months and never sent anything to Congress. Congress delayed the punitive spending cuts for a while and then just let them go into effect. They are, in fact, still in effect\u2014but now Congress votes every few years to temporarily cancel some of the automatic cuts to discretionary spending. In other words, all this high-stakes procedural confrontation simply produced another pointless artificial cliff. And far from achieving some golden-mean version of sober, fiscally restrained governance, it only increased the likelihood that the framework of budgeting-by-extortion would be used to extract demands from some future president or Congress\u2014say, over a feckless plan to erect a wall to contain a nonexistent threat of rampaging immigrant criminality pouring across the Mexican border.\n\nThe fiscal cliff endgame was an outcome no one really wanted, which is what passes for \u201ccompromise\u201d and \u201cbipartisanship\u201d in some segments of the political press. And while it did cut spending for a few years, it did so at the expense of something President Obama was, at various points in his presidency, practically desperate to sign into law with Republican support: a package of massive permanent spending cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and other programs. Republicans had a Democratic president who wanted to help them achieve one of their supposed signature policy goals, and they simply refused to allow him to do it. McConnell\u2019s great victory was that he came in at the last minute to sign off on a deal designed to extort major policy outcomes that he and his party were solemnly pledged to support, but that his party then capsized out of pique and incompetence.\n\nMcConnell has nearly all of his Republican colleagues beat: His moderation itself was cynical.\n\nBut here we encounter another blank mystery for the oracles: Does Mitch McConnell really care if government spending rises or falls? Does he truly care if Social Security is privatized? His benefactors do, sure\u2014and he cares about what they want for what are (yet again) painfully obvious reasons. But any issue without direct relevance to McConnell\u2019s political fortunes is, for him, negotiable. Prior to the 2006 midterms, which were not looking good for the Republican Party, McConnell even advised President Bush to withdraw from Iraq to save the election. That\u2019s how much he cares about the conservative project, as opposed to electoral success. The neocons wanted power in order to use it to shape the world. McConnell wanted to shape the world into one in which he continues to have power, and he did. Which is all to say, if he had doubts about Trump in 2016, they evaporated on election night, just as his doubts about his fourth-ranked presidential choice did back in 1980.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s worth asking if we haven\u2019t been thinking about McConnell\u2019s political \u201cevolution\u201d all wrong from the beginning. Was he a liberal Republican\u2014who still talks about witnessing Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s March on Washington as a young Senate intern\u2014who cynically adapted to changing circumstances? Did he, like fellow pro-choice-Republican-turned-abortion-foe George H.W. Bush, sell out to win? Or was he just a Republican, period, who was a \u201cliberal\u201d one only because he then believed that was the most viable road to success in the party? He was strategically a Rockefeller Republican at a time when you could still make a bet that such socially moderate business types would survive the successive righteous onslaughts of the conservative movement. He has nearly all of his Republican colleagues beat: His moderation itself was cynical.\n\nIf McConnell\u2019s entire goal has been his political advancement within the Senate (which also requires supporting the Republican Party electorally by any means necessary), his career trajectory suddenly develops a tidy narrative throughline. He was a bit aimless in his early years in office, because he hadn\u2019t arrived in the Senate with an ideological mission. He randomly threw his support behind an expensive health care plan and even backed federally subsidized family leave to fend off his first Democratic challenger for reelection. It was not quite the record of a future party leader.\n\nBut he was consistent\u2014or rather, consistently inconsistent in one strategic direction\u2014about one issue: campaign finance, on which he very quickly developed a reputation as an expert. He knew fundraising was his primary political strength and probably the only reason he was even in office to begin with.\n\nHis problem was that, back in early 1990s, limiting money in politics was a popular and mostly bipartisan idea, and the main disagreements were about what kinds of money to restrict and how to do it. And over the years, McConnell shamelessly, fluidly recalibrated his arguments based on what was more useful to him, and then his party, at that moment.\n\nMacGillis patiently chronicles this process in his book: When McConnell felt he wasn\u2019t getting enough support from PACs, he wanted PACs banned. When he thought Democrats were outperforming Republicans with \u201csoft money\u201d\u2014 contributions from corporations and unions to parties, not individual candidates\u2014 McConnell wanted soft money banned. By the end of the \u201990s, when it was clear how much Republicans were benefiting from soft money, he was vociferously defending it from the attacks of his Republican Senate colleague John McCain, who\u2019d made it his mission to rein in political spending. For years, McConnell argued for disclosure of donors instead of spending restrictions. By the 2010s, when Democrats were pushing exactly that position to curb some of the deregulatory excesses of the Citizens United ruling\u2014which represents the closest thing you\u2019ll find to a lodestar for McConnell\u2019s belief system\u2014the Senate leader of course reversed himself yet again.\n\nHe also made an important rhetorical shift, one that tracked closely with his second great political crusade: enabling the slow but implacable death march of right-wing jurisprudence. Early on in McConnell\u2019s career, he mainly made his case for opposing campaign spending restrictions in pragmatic terms. But in 1995, he reversed his position on a flag-burning ban in order, critics charge, to more credibly pursue his new campaign of pushing all political spending as First Amendment\u2013\u200bprotected speech, aligning him with the conservative legal movement. (It may seem silly, but coming up with a principles-based reason for a decision that will have a politically or materially beneficial outcome for you or your side is a cornerstone of conservative legal theory.)\n\nThe most powerful Senate majority leader over the past decade is an errand boy for both an errant billionaire class of campaign donors, and an errant billionaire president.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting, as one wades through the brackish capitulations to plutocratic power that Mitch McConnell has always loudly and forcefully embraced as a vindication of his first principles, that his is a case in which the personal is very much political. When you spend so much of your time asking rich people for money, it does help to have a lot of it yourself, so you have something in common. Curiously, McConnell\u2019s own personal fortunes are frequently left out of his profiles, perhaps because it appears vaguely unseemly for reporters or editors to just come out and say the plain truth: He married into money, which had enormous political benefits. This is not to make any unsavory insinuation about the nature of his relationship with Elaine Chao\u2014it is, however, to note that she was a wealthy shipping heiress when they married, and he was effectively a lifelong politician who\u2019d barely sniffed the private sector. Even before the marriage, Chao\u2019s wealthy father had been a large Mitch McConnell donor; after, he became an even more enthusiastic one. He also gave the couple at least one reported gift of millions of dollars. In 2016, Mitch McConnell was estimated to be worth around $27 million.\n\nMcConnell knew first that unlimited fundraising was the key to his own political fortunes. He came to realize it was the best way for the Republicans to keep their power too, as unions declined and corporate power, along with income inequality, rose and rose. Republicans have a built-in advantage in a world of unlimited political spending. It took McConnell\u2019s forceful arguments with people like John McCain to get them all to come around to his way of thinking.\n\nMcConnell spent most of his career scheming to become the top Republican in the Senate, so it must have been a profound disappointment that he was not able to do so until 2007, by which time the Bush administration had so destroyed the reputation of the Republican Party that it had lost both houses of Congress. McConnell\u2019s Senate colleagues elected him minority leader in a blaze of powerless compromise. The remaining moderates thought they had chosen someone who\u2019d have their back as the party continued to lurch rightward. He absolutely would do anything to help any Republican senator keep their seat\u2014he tossed a couple of million dollars for infrastructure to Rhode Island to aid liberal GOP incumbent Lincoln Chafee\u2019s doomed reelection bid\u2014and he did exert some effort to keep the most extreme candidates from winning primaries (for electoral, not ideological, reasons). But if the GOP was trending wingnut and kept winning elections, McConnell would go along with that plan just as readily. (Chafee, for his part, mounted a brief run at the presidency in 2016\u2014as a Democrat.)\n\nThis is where the story of how Mitch McConnell saved the GOP begins. The infamous strategy that McConnell dreamed up and put into action to throttle any putative accomplishment of the Obama White House, no matter how nugatory, has become the stuff of right-wing parliamentary lore. We know the quote about his main priority being to make Obama a one-term president. It\u2019s easy to forget now, though, the long odds he faced.\n\nThe GOP after Bush should have been finished for a generation. It was utterly defeated, and a Democratic president had just been elected\u2014via the Democrats\u2019 fourth popular vote victory of the last five presidential elections\u2014in a near-\u200blandslide. Massive Democratic majorities were installed in both houses, and the Senate Democratic caucus flirted with the true golden ring of power: an actual filibuster-proof majority. The economy was in ruins, and everyone knew who was to blame for that: Republicans. The signature policy of the Bush administration, the Iraq War, was acknowledged by all to be a catastrophic failure. The situation looked about as bad for Republicans as it had on FDR\u2019s inauguration day. But they surged back into power almost immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of interconnected reasons for this, including but not restricted to: Barack Obama\u2019s early decision to move on from further investigation (let alone prosecution) of Bush administration officials; political choices made to prioritize stabilizing Wall Street over providing relief to homeowners; and the Democratic Party\u2019s long-term inability or unwillingness to treat the Republican Party as an extreme and malign force that must be defeated, instead of negotiated with. And McConnell can\u2019t take credit for personally creating the conditions that led to the plainly racist national backlash against the first black president (he has a few generations of predecessors in his party and the conservative movement to thank for that). But he does deserve the credit he has received for ruining the honeymoon: for taking a moment of national inspiration and almost immediately souring it. In 2009, Republican senators, like most senators in the old days, were still driven to cut deals and negotiate compromises to make themselves feel important. Democrats hungered to give them opportunities to have input into major legislation. \u201cI was determined to demonstrate how the Senate could still work,\u201d MacGillis quotes Connecticut Democrat Chris Dodd saying, after he duly sought Republican participation in the effort to craft a financial regulation bill. Of course, McConnell had to prove the opposite. And McConnell, as a political nihilist, always has an advantage over people determined to prove things work: It\u2019s much easier to simply make things not work, if the only outcome you care about is electoral.\n\nSo Republicans in Congress painstakingly drew out the negotiations over the Obama agenda while stigmatizing the results as rank political perfidy. They created and stoked, via the Koch-funded antics of the Tea Party, a national backlash against the Affordable Care Act. And against all odds, Republicans managed to take back the House two years into Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nEven so, the 2012 presidential election was another wake-up call: Americans still mostly hated Republicans and their ideas and their politicians. Some Republicans understood this and began circulating memos calling for the party to find ways to appeal to young people, Latino voters, and moderates. Others started laying the groundwork for a full-on revival of Pat Buchanan\u2019s herrenvolk brand of white populism."

    "text": "The Obama administration viewed Orb\u00e1n\u2019s demonization of refugees as part of a larger anti-democratic campaign to silence political opposition, stifle the free press, erode the independence of the judiciary, and scapegoat supposed outsiders as conspirators against Hungary\u2019s sovereignty. A few days before Rohrabacher\u2019s committee hearing, Colleen Bell, the U.S. ambassador to Hungary, delivered a public condemnation of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s open xenophobia. \u201cEvery sovereign nation has the right to protect its borders,\u201d Bell said. \u201cBut every nation, as a part of the international community, also has a fundamental obligation to help refugee populations seeking safety. Words of intolerance and xenophobic characterizations of refugees\u2014some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people\u2014as invaders and antagonists have no role in our efforts to find a solution.\u201d\n\nThat line of criticism did not sit well with Rohrabacher. At the committee hearing a few days later, the congressman thanked Hungary\u2019s then-ambassador to the United States, R\u00e9ka Szemerk\u00e9nyi, for attending. The right-wing lawmaker then praised Hungary as a \u201ctremendous friend and asset to the peace and stability of the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am personally upset,\u201d Rohrabacher continued, \u201cthat our administration has sought to find out and try to complain about every little thing they disagree with, with Hungary. Hungary has every right to set their own policies, and I am pleased that Hungary has a track record of doing good things with the United States.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Rohrabacher\u2019s support for Orb\u00e1n placed him outside the political mainstream in the United States. Obama White House officials weren\u2019t the only public figures calling out Orb\u00e1n\u2019s strongman rule; Republicans were as well. In 2014, Arizona Senator John McCain called Orb\u00e1n \u201ca neofascist dictator getting in bed with Vladimir Putin\u201d and accused him of \u201cpracticing the same kinds of anti-democratic practices\u201d as the Russian president. And in the years immediately following Hungary\u2019s admission into nato in 1999, the George W. Bush administration also confronted Orb\u00e1n when he departed from basic commitments to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law\u2014criticism that Orb\u00e1n believed cost him his bid for reelection in 2002, and that fueled his animosity toward the United States.\n\nThis broader consensus on authoritarian rule in Hungary rendered Rohrabacher a bit of a pariah among some of his Republican colleagues, the foreign policy heavyweights. \u201cThere\u2019s a lunatic fringe in every organization,\u201d McCain said of Rohrabacher in 2016. But while Rohrabacher may have been on the outs with some Republicans, he made fast friends with like-minded politicians across the Atlantic. And when figures like Orb\u00e1n looked at Rohrabacher, they saw a kindred spirit.\n\nOther Republican lawmakers associated with the strongman caucus embraced Europe\u2019s far-right nationalists long before Trump\u2019s election. In April 2015, King, the Iowa Republican known for his virulent anti-immigrant diatribes and racist tweets, invited Geert Wilders, the founder of the Netherlands\u2019 far-right Party for Freedom, to speak to a weekly breakfast gathering of House Republicans. There, Wilders issued a call to arms. \u201cOur duty is clear,\u201d he told the lawmakers. \u201cWe have to stop mass immigration to the West from Islamic countries. And we have to get rid of the cultural relativism.\u201d\n\nKing was eager to spread the word. \u201cGeert Wilders speaking now before Members of Congress & national security experts,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIslam will not assimilate. Western culture is superior.\u201d The next day, the congressman called a press conference on the Capitol grounds. Flanked by fellow Republican Representatives Gohmert and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, King argued that the United States needed to form tighter bonds with Europe\u2019s nationalist leaders. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to expand and build our networks across the ocean, and to tie together the anchor that is Western civilization,\u201d he said. In 2016, Wilders secured an invitation to the Republican National Convention.\n\nFar-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders on Capitol Hill in April 2015, flanked by GOP lawmakers Louie Gohmert (left) and Steve King (right) Brendan Smialowski/AFP.Getty\n\nMainstream GOP leaders have long regarded King, like, Rohrabacher, as a loudmouth on the party\u2019s far-right flank. In 2013, after King accused undocumented immigrants of having \u201ccalves the size of cantaloupes because they\u2019re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert,\u201d Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner condemned the comments as \u201cdeeply offensive and wrong\u201d and said King\u2019s remarks did not \u201creflect the values of the American people, or the Republican Party.\u201d (Later, when King\u2019s comments were brought up in a private conversation, Boehner reportedly replied, \u201cWhat an asshole.\u201d) Boehner resigned from Congress in 2015, however\u200b\u2014forced out by the ascendant far-right Freedom Caucus\u2014and the current Republican leadership was long disinclined to criticize King for his outlandish remarks, particularly as his views gained currency in Trump\u2019s Washington. During the 2016 election cycle, Republican presidential hopefuls sought King\u2019s endorsement ahead of the Iowa caucuses, and Ted Cruz named King co-chair of his presidential campaign. Last June, when King approvingly retweeted a well-known Nazi sympathizer, House Republican leaders remained silent. It was only in January, after King explicitly defended white supremacy in an interview with The New York Times, that House GOP leaders finally sanctioned him, stripping him of his committee assignments, a move that King\u2019s far-right and evangelical defenders roundly denounced.\n\nIn November 2015, with the presidential primaries in full swing, and just after Rohrabacher held his hearing on the refugee crisis, King traveled to Europe to investigate the crisis himself. The trip, which went unnoticed in the national media, was recorded in the congressional record as official business of the House Judiciary Committee, on which King served. But King was the only lawmaker to go\u2014an unusual arrangement, since taxpayer-funded congressional travel usually involves a bipartisan delegation. (King did not respond to interview requests from The New Republic.)\n\nKing provided updates from small towns along the Serbia-Croatia border via his Twitter feed. \u201c6000 migrants/day transit through here at Adasevci, Serbia. From as far as Pakistan, mostly young Muslim males,\u201d King wrote. From Sid, Serbia, he shared another observation: \u201ctrains bound 4 Croatia-Slovenia-Austria then Germany. 1000 people per train. 6 trains per day. No end.\u201d He praised the fence along Hungary\u2019s borders with Croatia and Serbia for keeping refugees at bay. Europe was committing \u201ccultural suicide\u201d by admitting so many Muslim refugees, King told The New York Times, and he worried that President Obama was encouraging a similar decline in the United States. \u201cThe president is determined to import to America hundreds of thousands of displaced persons who will never assimilate into the American civilization.\u201d\n\nMembers of Austria\u2019s far-right Freedom Party attended a gathering in Trump Tower. \u201cThings are changing,\u201d the party\u2019s general secretary said. \u201cAnd we get to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nThe following year, in October 2016, King once again traveled alone on an official congressional trip to forge new ties with nationalist leaders\u2014this time to France, Finland, and Austria. In Vienna, King met with members of the far right, Putin-backed Freedom Party, which is hostile to Islam and the influx of refugees into Austria, and which secured a place in Austria\u2019s coalition government in 2017. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of a friendship,\u201d King told Freedom Party leader Norbert Hofer in a video posted on the party\u2019s web site.\n\nAbout a week before the presidential election, a delegation of Freedom Party officials visited New York, Washington, and North Carolina to meet with supporters. They spent time with General Mike Flynn, then Trump\u2019s national security adviser, in Trump Tower\u2014a meeting arranged by King, according to The Wall Street Journal. In Charlotte, North Carolina, Republican Representative Robert Pittenger hosted the politicians and said he had known them for years from meetings in the United States and Europe. In Washington, the Austrians met with supporters they knew from earlier gatherings, including the National Prayer Breakfast and CPAC, according to the Journal. Finally, the Austrians witnessed Trump\u2019s presidential victory at an election night party in Trump Tower. \u201cThings are changing,\u201d Harald Vilimsky, the Freedom Party\u2019s general secretary, wrote on Facebook that day. \u201cAnd we get to be a part of it. What an honor.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s election may have accelerated the transformation of America\u2019s foreign policy. But just as right-wing lawmakers like Rohrabacher and King had spent years cultivating relationships with like-minded leaders across the Atlantic, so too had nationalist politicians in Europe worked diligently to make inroads in America. In 2008, still stinging from the Bush administration\u2019s rebuke, Viktor Orb\u00e1n began plotting his return to power in Hungary. To help him, he hired Arthur J. Finkelstein, the reclusive American political strategist who was an early mastermind of red-meat Republican attack ads, as a political consultant for his Fidesz party.\n\nFinkelstein, who died in 2017, made his reputation as a major campaign player on the right by successfully recasting the word \u201cliberal\u201d as a pejorative in U.S. politics\u2014and through his counsel to clients that a winning strategy was to \u201cpolarize the electorate.\u201d Over the decades, he advised the campaigns of Ronald Reagan, Jesse Helms, Orrin Hatch, and many other Republicans, as well as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu; his many prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, known as \u201cArthur\u2019s kids,\u201d include recently indicted Trump adviser Roger Stone and Trump campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio. In 2011, in a rare public appearance at the CEVRO Institute, a university in Prague, Finkelstein predicted that voters, provoked by cataclysmic world events, would become increasingly drawn to xenophobia and nationalism. This combustible realignment of political views, Finkelstein explained, would translate into a resurgent longing for strongman leaders throughout the world, short on specific policy proposals, but long on authoritarian swagger. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anybody is watching Donald Trump in the United States, but it\u2019s mind-boggling, it\u2019s just pure personality,\u201d Finkelstein said, presciently.\n\nIn his work for Orb\u00e1n, Finkelstein took his signature strategy of political polarization and masterminded a campaign that cast Hungary as a victim suffering at the hands of the United States, the United Nations, and other purveyors of Western liberal democracy. Finkelstein was, according to Politico, behind the anti-immigration billboards that have proliferated in Hungary over the past decade. Thanks at least in part to Finkelstein\u2019s strategy, Orb\u00e1n won his reelection bid in 2010. After winning reelection again in 2014, Orb\u00e1n openly declared his intention to make Hungary an \u201cilliberal democracy.\u201d\n\nMarion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen addresses the Republican crowd at CPAC in February 2018. Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call/Getty\n\nRather than court the American diplomatic establishment, which was openly critical of him, the Hungarian prime minister turned to a more pliable institution: K Street. In October 2014, his government signed a contract with Connie Mack IV, a Republican congressman-turned-lobbyist from Florida who served four terms in the House before losing a bid for the Senate in 2012. Mack was one of the founding members of the House\u2019s hard-line Freedom Caucus and served on the Foreign Affairs Committee. He had hired Finkelstein as a consultant on his campaigns and described him as \u201ca friend\u201d to whom he often turned for advice.\n\nMack\u2019s contract with the Hungarian government catapulted him into the top ranks of the revolving-door profiteers on K Street. In 2015, he was one of the five most highly paid foreign agents in Washington, pulling in more than a million dollars from his lobbying work for Orb\u00e1n, according to an analysis by Politico of filings under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. (Mack also did not respond to interview requests from The New Republic.)\n\nMack\u2019s job on behalf of Orb\u00e1n was to craft \u201cpolitical messages\u201d to deliver to the White House, Congress, and the media, in order to \u201chave an influence on political decision making,\u201d according to his contract, obtained through a review of his FARA filings. J.D. Gordon, a former Pentagon spokesman who himself went on to develop relationships with powerful Hungarians and promote Trump\u2019s burgeoning ties with Budapest as a national security adviser to the 2016 Trump campaign, described Mack to me as \u201ca very effective and influential ally.\u201d\n\nConnie Mack\u2019s contract with Orb\u00e1n paid him more than a million dollars in 2015 \u2014catapulting him into the top ranks of the revolving-door profiteers on K Street.\n\nAccording to disclosures Mack filed with the U.S. government, he maintains regular contact with members of Congress and their staffs, as well as with conservative think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation. He also has ongoing contact with the Trump White House. He has communicated with Vice President Mike Pence, National Security Adviser John Bolton, and, before he resigned in August 2017, White House adviser Sebastian Gorka, a native Hungarian with far-right ties. Mack also distributes a newsletter, \u201cHungary Insights,\u201d which includes frequent reminders of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s early support for Trump and roundups of positive news reports about Orb\u00e1n, such as coverage of his friendly relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (though Mack makes scant reference in this p.r. offensive to Orb\u00e1n\u2019s condemnation by human rights advocates for fomenting anti-Semitism).\n\nOn the day of another Rohrabacher hearing on mass migration in Europe, in April 2018, Mack sent Rohrabacher a packet of materials that included a letter from the new Hungarian ambassador to the United States, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szab\u00f3, arguing that \u201cpublic sentiment in Europe is largely on Hungary\u2019s side\u201d on the issue of migration. Rohrabacher entered the document into the congressional record.\n\nIn a November 2017 appearance on Blunt Force Truth, a podcast hosted by former Love Connection host Chuck Woolery, now a conservative celebrity, Mack explained his support for Orb\u00e1n. He is \u201ca conservative,\u201d Mack said. \u201cI wish that our State Department would treat him more like a friend and an ally instead of some of these underlings attacking him for things that George Soros is making up.\u201d\n\nSoros, the Hungarian-born philanthropist who has spent hundreds of millions of dollars promoting civil society and liberal democracy in Eastern Europe over the past three decades, has become a b\u00eate noire for Republicans and for far-right extremists; last fall, a Trump supporter from Florida allegedly mailed a pipe bomb to Soros\u2019s home. (Type Investigations, the journalism nonprofit that is an editorial partner on this story, has received support from the Open Society Foundations, which Soros founded.) In Mack\u2019s framing, therefore, Orb\u00e1n was not an illiberal autocrat who abused human rights and destroyed democratic institutions, but rather a crusader for Western civilization whom the global left was unfairly demonizing. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s goal in working with Washington insiders was to get \u201cthe foreign policy world that could make life miserable for Hungary to think that he was just an ordinary conservative government\u2014a garden-variety conservative state besieged by liberals,\u201d said Kim Lane Scheppele, a Hungary expert at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton.\n\nOther nationalist politicians in Europe have employed a similar strategy. A 2017 investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, a transnational consortium of investigative journalists that is partially funded by the Open Society Foundations, found that between 2015 and 2017, the far-right VMRO party in Macedonia engaged in a concerted lobbying campaign in Washington, which \u201cprompted U.S. conservatives to join in on an anti-Soros line of attack favored by Russia and Europe\u2019s authoritarian nationalists.\u201d\n\nThe Obama State Department had condemned the \u201cinflammatory rhetoric\u201d of some Macedonian politicians, which \u201cgives license to attacks on democratic institutions.\u201d Three days before Trump\u2019s inauguration, however, Senator Mike Lee, the influential Republican of Utah, who chairs the Senate Steering Committee, the powerful caucus of the chamber\u2019s conservatives, wrote an angry letter to Jess Baily, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, criticizing America\u2019s meddling. \u201cI have received credible reports that, over the past few years, the U.S. Mission to Macedonia has actively intervened in the party politics of Macedonia, as well as in the shaping of its media environment and civil society, often favoring groups of one political persuasion over another,\u201d Lee wrote. This, the senator argued, was \u201chighly problematic.\u201d (In contrast, Lee has sought to wave away Russian interference in the 2016 election, arguing that the Mueller probe is unconstitutional. He also blocked a Senate resolution to protect Mueller\u2019s investigation against interference by Trump.)\n\nHungarian Ambassador R\u00e9ka Szemerk\u00e9nyi socialized with Trump and the first lady at an event at Mar-a-Lago in February 2017. R\u00e9ka Szemerk\u00e9nyi\n\nTwo months later, Lee followed up with another letter to then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, specifically attacking Soros-funded programs that \u201cpush a progressive agenda and invigorate the political left.\u201d Lee, along with five Republican Senate colleagues\u2014James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, David Perdue of Georgia, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, and Ted Cruz\u2014demanded an investigation into \u201call funds associated with promoting democracy and governance.\u201d The language of the letter echoed that of a pamphlet distributed on Capitol Hill by a VMRO-backed Macedonian group called Stop Operation Soros.\n\nWhen countries \u201care getting in trouble on human rights, rule of law, the governance direction of the country,\u201d said Heather Conley, who served in the George W. Bush State Department, they \u201cflood Washington with funding\u201d to lobbyists and think tanks to soften the story or make it go away. According to the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project report, for example, Macedonia\u2019s VMRO party spent more than a million dollars on lobbyists and p.r. firms between 2015 and 2017. \u201cInstead of us fixing the problem,\u201d Conley said, \u201cthey fix us.\u201d\n\nA high-profile example of this dynamic is the now-infamous lobbying contract that Paul Manafort signed with Ukraine\u2019s strongman president, Viktor Yanukovych, in 2013. Yanukovych enlisted Manafort to mount a charm offensive on his behalf; from 2012 to 2014, according to the Associated Press, Manafort helped steer at least $2.2 million to two Washington lobbying firms. In a memo to Yanukovych in February 2013, buried in a court filing in his criminal tax fraud case, Manafort argued that changes in the composition of the U.S. Congress created an opportunity to \u201cexpand relationships, open minds, and demonstrate to the global community that Ukraine is a modern democracy.\u201d\n\nIn particular, Manafort noted, Yanukovych had a dependable ally who had just been installed by the House leadership in a powerful position: Dana Rohrabacher, then the new chair of the Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Rohrabacher, Manafort assured his client, is \u201ca good appointment for Ukraine and will be open minded about key policy issues.\u201d In contrast, Manafort noted, the Human Rights and Democracy Subcommittee will \u201cseek to pressure the VY Government.\u201d Therefore, Manafort wrote, \u201cthe best block of its actions is to have the pertinent SubCommittee on Europe take more positive stands. This is the strategy we are building.\u201d\n\nBy the time Trump was elected president, the trope that conservatives were under assault by left-wing elites, as epitomized by George Soros and the Obama administration, was an article of faith in the GOP. Indeed, an infamous Trump TV spot aired widely during the last week of the campaign featured an image of Soros as a sinister, unaccountable funder of globalist interests who was seeking to sway the election on Hillary Clinton\u2019s behalf. In April 2017, at a Heritage Foundation event, Mike Lee argued that under Obama, U.S. diplomacy \u201ctook a decidedly leftist turn,\u201d taking up the \u201cpet causes of a privileged global elite\u201d such as abortion and \u201calternative family structures\u201d\u2014a reference to the Obama administration\u2019s support for LGBT rights. Lee mocked American efforts to bolster embattled civic institutions in fledgling democracies as \u201cthe substance of a global re-education campaign, funded by American taxpayers, from whom they were hidden under the guise of innocuous sounding program titles like \u2018democracy assistance,\u2019 \u2018government transparency,\u2019 and \u2018human-rights.\u2019\u201d\n\nMainstream conservative media outlets echoed and amplified Lee\u2019s views. That spring, the American Spectator published a series of laudatory articles on Macedonia\u2019s far right, as did other conservative outlets, including Fox News, Breitbart, and The Daily Caller\u2014as well as Russian state media outlets RT and Sputnik. In one article, the Spectator described \u201csmall but mighty Macedonia\u201d as \u201cthe mouse that roared this year, declaring war on George Soros . . . and his U.S. Government handmaidens, who, incredibly, have financed a left-wing agenda to divide the nation and bring a socialist-Muslim coalition to power.\u201d\n\nIn February 2017, the Conservative Political Action Conference welcomed in its exhibit hall the Europe of Nations and Freedom, a coalition of far-right political parties in the European Parliament, including Austria\u2019s Freedom Party, France\u2019s National Front, and the Netherlands\u2019s Party for Freedom. A coalition representative told me that he hoped their attendance at America\u2019s premier conservative gathering would lead to \u201charmonized cooperation between the United States and Europe.\u201d\n\nThe following year, CPAC featured a speech that won wide acclaim from the event\u2019s activist Republican audience, by a woman billed as a supporter of \u201cschool choice, private property, lower taxes, less government spending, market competition, and traditional marriage.\u201d This was Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen, the granddaughter of National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, a notorious Holocaust denier. In her nationalistic remarks, Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen embraced Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d rhetoric and anti-immigration policies, and decried \u201cthe development of an Islamic counter-society in France.\u201d She criticized the European Union, calling it \u201can ideology without land, without people, without roots, and without civilization,\u201d and warned that France was \u201cpassing from the eldest daughter of the Catholic Church to the little niece of Islam.\u201d To the assembled Republicans, she vowed, \u201cThis is not the France that our grandparents fought for. . . . Just like you, we want our country back.\u201d Over the course of her ten-minute address, the CPAC crowd clapped, cheered, and cried \u201cVive la France!\u201d Slowly but surely, the extreme nativist views that just a few years earlier had occupied the outer reaches of the Republican fringe had become firmly ensconced in the mainstream.\n\nIn years past, seasoned diplomats and career government officials might have been able to use America\u2019s political and economic influence to pressure European autocrats to conform to an American worldview that, however inconsistently applied, included lifting up democratic values and institutions. But Trump has hollowed out the State Department. The president has yet to name a nominee to 37 senior State posts, 38 of his department nominees still await Senate confirmation, and he has yet to name replacements for more than a dozen others. Early in his tenure, Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s first secretary of state, signaled to his employees at State that promoting human rights and democracy abroad could often create an \u201cobstacle\u201d to advancing U.S. interests.\n\nIt is in fact the Trump administration\u2019s view that America\u2019s interests are aligned with the likes of autocrats like Viktor Orb\u00e1n. R\u00e9ka Szemerk\u00e9nyi, who served as Hungary\u2019s ambassador to the United States until July 2017, was in frequent contact with Trump campaign and administration officials\u2014even mingling with the president and first lady at Mar-a-Lago. In the fall of 2016, Trump campaign adviser Carter Page traveled to Budapest at Szemerk\u00e9nyi\u2019s behest, he later told congressional investigators, for a private meeting with Jeno Megyesy, a top Orb\u00e1n adviser. Jeff Sessions also met with Szemerk\u00e9nyi in April 2016 and later sent her a letter, which has not been previously reported, praising Hungary as \u201ca global beacon for the power of freedom, democracy, and human rights.\u201d In December 2016, Trump campaign adviser J.D. Gordon also traveled to Budapest, where he delivered a speech at the Antall J\u00f3zsef Knowledge Center, a local think tank. \u201cWe very much admire and respect Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n and what he is doing to make Hungary great again,\u201d Gordon said, according to the Budapest Business Journal. \u201cHe is one of the best world leaders, in my opinion, because he has common sense and he understands the threats from open borders.\u201d Trump and Orb\u00e1n, Gordon predicted, \u201cwill be good friends.\u201d\n\nMarion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen\u2019s nationalistic speech at CPAC won wide acclaim from the Republicans in attendance, who clapped, cheered, and cried \u201cVive la France!\u201d\n\nIn the absence of pressure from the U.S. foreign policy establishment, Europe\u2019s far-right regimes have become emboldened. In June 2018, for example, the Hungarian Parliament passed a law that criminalizes aid to refugees and migrants. Human Rights Watch condemned the measure as an attempt to silence critics and block the work of NGOs attempting to aid asylum seekers. But neither the White House nor the State Department raised any criticism, and both have called for stronger U.S.-Hungarian ties. The following month, the State Department canceled a program intended to support media outlets engaged in fact-based reporting in Hungary. The Obama administration had invited organizations to apply for $700,000 in funding that would go toward training journalists, expanding their audiences, and increasing the public\u2019s access to \u201creliable and unbiased information.\u201d Connie Mack and pro-Orb\u00e1n Republicans in Congress, however, including Rohrabacher and Maryland\u2019s Andy Harris, the co-chair of the Hungarian American Congressional Caucus, demanded that the government ax the program.\n\nThe Trump administration has continued to close ranks behind Orb\u00e1n. In November, after meeting with the prime minister in Budapest, Energy Secretary Rick Perry tweeted a photograph of the pair in a warm handshake, saying he hoped it \u201ccan mark the beginning of an even closer relationship between the U.S. & Hungary.\u201d The meeting was not covered in the U.S. press. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s office boasted that \u201cHungarian-U.S. relations are excellent,\u201d and noted that the two countries \u201cconfirmed that historical traditions and Christian roots must also play an important role in modern governance.\u201d\n\nEven though the Democrats regained control of the House last November, the reversal of party control in one chamber will not produce any swift pushback to this rising autocratic tide. Trump has used the prerogatives of the executive branch to nearly obliterate U.S. censure of anti-democratic regimes. What\u2019s more, the strongman caucus is continuing to accrue power on the GOP side of the aisle. Dana Rohrabacher may be gone, but many other influential members of the party\u2019s far-right flank remain in office, including Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Andy Harris, Steve King, and Louie Gohmert.\n\nNationalist orthodoxy within the Republican Party has gained additional ground as more moderate voices on foreign policy, like Ed Royce of California, who long chaired the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Bob Corker, the former chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have retired, leaving their party to more extreme factions. In November, Tennessee voters elected longtime Representative Marsha Blackburn to fill Corker\u2019s seat. In 2017, Blackburn, along with King and other Republicans, met with Heinz-Christian Strache and other members of Austria\u2019s Freedom Party.\n\nMoreover, conservative think tanks like the Heritage Foundation, activist groups like Judicial Watch, and conservative media outlets like Fox News and Breitbart have created a powerful opinion echo chamber that reinforces the nationalist and xenophobic positions of the autocratic right. By cheering the GOP\u2019s embrace of autocrats\u2014and packaging it in familiar conspiracy theories that cast Soros and other liberal donors as shadowy puppet-masters plotting against well-meaning, patriotic conservatives\u2014they have helped convince the Republican base of the acceptability of these far-right ideas. A \u201cRepublican phalanx\u201d has effectively dislodged Washington\u2019s longstanding bipartisan foreign policy consensus around democracy promotion, said Scheppele, to the point that \u201cyou can\u2019t take that for granted anymore.\u201d\n\nThis is why future administrations will have a hard time stemming the ominous global advance of right-wing strongmen. Right-wing lawmakers, lobbyists, consultants, media outlets, and think tanks have worked for years to foment the Republican base\u2019s opposition to \u201cglobal elites.\u201d Trump helped stoke that same anger, and won the presidency as a result. But in truth, the most significant change is not Trump\u2019s ascension; it\u2019s something much larger and more unsettling. Today\u2019s conservative leaders\u2014the voices who now make up the strongman caucus\u2014have come of age under the conviction that U.S. policies supporting democracy, human rights, and a free press abroad are all essentially equivalent to their domestic enemy\u2014liberalism\u2014and therefore must be destroyed.\n\nAdditional research was done by Julia Herrnb\u00f6ck and Jaime Longoria."

    "text": "With a few strokes on his keyboard on Thursday, President Trump undermined one of the fundamental norms of international law. \u201cAfter 52 years,\u201d he tweeted, \u201cit is time for the United States to fully recognize Israel\u2019s Sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which is of critical strategic and security importance to the State of Israel and Regional Stability!\u201d The timing of the tweet, 19 days ahead of Israel\u2019s elections, suggests that Trump is determined to assist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s reelection efforts, despite the prospect of increasing tensions with Arab leaders, Europe, and Russia, all of whom vehemently oppose recognizing Israel\u2019s Golan Heights claim. It will also embolden the Israeli far-right, which has been pushing for annexation of the West Bank.\n\nIsrael captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Six Day War. In 1981, the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, passed a law annexing the Golan, despite the clear prohibition in international law on forcible acquisition of land. In response, the UN Security Council passed resolution 497 determining that the Israeli law is \u201cnull and void.\u201d No country to date has recognized the annexation of the Golan and Israel itself conducted negotiations with the Syrian regime for the return of the entire territory in exchange for peace.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Syrian uprising in 2011 that devolved into a ferocious civil war, Israeli officials recognized the opportunity to win international legitimacy for the annexation of the Golan. As the Assad regime resorted to utilizing chemical weapons, barrel bombs and starvation sieges to crush the armed rebellion and protest movement, killing thousands of Syrians in the process, no international actor attempted to pressure Israel into negotiating with Assad. Israeli officials pushed the Obama administration to recognize Israel\u2019s annexation of the Golan, but came up short.\n\nTrump\u2019s presidency put multiple goals of Israel\u2019s right-wing government and even the Israeli far-right within grasp. In the first two years in office, the Trump administration withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal; cut U.S. funding to UNRWA, the UN agency in charge of providing relief to Palestinian refugees; softened its criticism of Israeli human rights abuses in the occupied Palestinian territories and at times even defended such abuses; and, most importantly, moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, implicitly recognizing Israel\u2019s annexation of east Jerusalem, which under previous deals negotiated between Israel and the Palestinians, is supposed to be the capital of a Palestinian state. Israeli officials began lobbying the Trump administration to recognize Israel\u2019s annexation of the Golan, but were previously unsuccessful, in part due to Russian pushback against recognition. (Russia has been providing military and diplomatic cover in support of the Assad regime)"

    "title": "The Growing Crisis of Guns on Campus",
    "authors": [
      "Matt Valentine"
    ],
    "text": "Other states did not immediately follow suit. But in 2007, the Virginia Tech massacre led to the formation of the group now called Students for Campus Carry, which quickly gained membership and attention nationwide. With support from SCC\u2014and, to a lesser extent, the NRA\u2014dozens of campus-carry bills were introduced in statehouses over the proceeding decade, many only passing after a second or third legislative session. Other states, such as Colorado and Oregon, adopted campus carry when universities lost court battles with gun rights advocates. Today, a complex patchwork of state laws makes it difficult even to say with clarity how many \u201ccampus carry\u201d states there are. (Eleven have permissive laws similar to Utah\u2019s; 16 ban guns completely; and 23 at least nominally allow guns on campus, but with more stringent restrictions and various caveats.)\n\nThe ostensible goal of campus carry was to empower armed civilians on college campuses to defend themselves and others from mortal danger. That has not yet happened. \u201cCampus carriers have not intervened in any incident anywhere in the country on a campus,\u201d said Stephen Boss, a professor of environmental dynamics and sustainability at the University of Arkansas.\n\nFor his new book, College Homicide: The Case Against Guns on Campus, Boss examined every campus homicide in the United States between 2001 and 2016. He found no direct interventions by campus carriers, and no deterrent effect. Murders are rare on campuses that allow concealed carry, but no rarer than on college campuses where guns are banned. \u201cUtah did pretty well for eight years,\u201d he said, \u201cand then a student shot himself [in the leg] at Weber State University in 2012, and then in 2016, \u201917, and \u201918, the last three years consecutively, there\u2019s been a murder with a gun on the campus of the University of Utah, Salt Lake. So their luck\u2019s run out.\u201d\n\n\n\nProfessors at the University of Texas at Austin are no longer allowed to post signs like this one. Jay Jenner/Austin American-Statesman via AP\n\nIn 2015, during the one-year window the Texas legislature allotted schools to prepare for campus carry, UT Austin hosted two public forums about the implementation. At one of these, I testified that the university should develop a protocol about what to do with guns left behind in bathroom stalls. (Should we bring them to lost and found? Call the police? Put an \u201cout of order\u201d sign on the door?) People laughed. A year later, students left guns in the women\u2019s bathrooms here twice in the same week. According to The Campaign to Keep Guns Off Campus, similar incidents have happened in Georgia and repeatedly in Kansas. And where there are guns, there will be accidents: An Idaho State professor shot himself in the foot during class, and an employee at the University of Colorado in Denver was trying to un-jam her gun when it went off, injuring herself and a coworker.\n\nIn addition to dealing with such accidents, campus-carry schools have spent millions adapting their physical infrastructure (installing gun safes, signage and metal detectors, for example), retraining staff, and replacing faculty members lost to attrition. Other instructors have changed their teaching practices by eliminating discussions of sensitive subjects that might raise tempers in the class, or by offering courses exclusively online, or even by holding office hours in bars or churches where guns are prohibited, rather than meet with armed students in their offices.\n\n\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the matter of campus suicide.\n\nThe late Allan Schwartz, a professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of Rochester, studied college suicide for the better part of two decades. In 2013, he published an article comparing suicide rates among college students with nonstudents. Using nationally representative data from 2007, he found that, among men age 18-24, the suicide rate was much lower\u2014about half\u2014for those enrolled in college. This, despite that fact that students and nonstudents attempt suicide at roughly the same rate (1.4 percent versus 1.8 percent).\n\nSchwartz considered various parameters that could account for the disparity, and became increasingly convinced that the single most consequential factor was access to guns. Students who lived on campus had a lower risk of suicide than those who lived off campus; those who were enrolled full time had a lower risk than those enrolled part time; those who stayed on campus continuously had a lower risk than those who went home for the weekends, and so on. The more time that students spent in an environment where guns were prohibited, the less likely they were to die by suicide.\n\nWhich wasn\u2019t surprising to mental health professionals. Decades of public health research have repeatedly demonstrated that access to guns increases the likelihood of a death by suicide. This is because over 80 percent of people who attempt suicide with a gun die as a result\u2014compared to less than 2 percent of those who use other common means, such as overdosing. And most people who attempt suicide and survive never make another attempt.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe more guns that are present, the higher the rates of suicide.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have no reason to think that the same sort of pattern wouldn\u2019t happen on college campuses that happens off college campuses\u2014the more guns that are present, the higher the rates of suicide,\u201d said Marjorie Sanfilippo, a psychologist at Eckerd College in Florida. To compare suicides at campus-carry schools and schools that prohibit guns, Sanfilippo has begun to survey the directors of college counseling centers across the country. So far, the results are stark: The campus-carry schools had significantly higher rates of both attempted and completed suicides. Sanfilippo acknowledges that her sample size thus far is very modest\u2014just 22 respondents. \u201cOf course, each one represents thousands of students,\u201d she said. She is planning to expand the scope of her research.\n\nLarge-scale research projects cost money, though, and when it comes to gun violence, the federal purse strings have been drawn tight for decades. Congress first threatened to defund the Centers for Disease Control in 1996 if it recommended any form of gun control. President Obama issued an executive order in 2013 instructing the CDC to identify priorities for gun violence research, and still the agency demurred. (Obama did get his report, but it was published by the National Research Council and was essentially an analysis of past research\u2014much of it decades old.) Language in last year\u2019s government spending bill softened the threat that gun research could imperil the agency\u2019s budget for injury prevention, but until funds are specifically allocated for gun research, the roadblock remains.\n\nAs long as the CDC avoids gun-related research, the institutions best equipped to study the issue are research universities, and they\u2019re about to receive a huge injection of funding for that express purpose. Over the next five years, the National Collaborative for Gun Violence Research plans to distribute up to $50 million from the RAND Corporation, specifically for academic research into gun violence. Sanfilippo is among the many researchers applying for support.\n\nMeanwhile, where campus carry has already been enacted, schools adapt. In 2016, UT Austin implemented a policy that allows faculty and staff members to prohibit guns in our offices. But we\u2019re only permitted to convey this rule verbally; we can\u2019t hang a sign saying, \u201cNo guns allowed.\u201d So my colleague George\u2014her nickname, as she resembles the Beatle\u2014came up with a work-around, which required the use of my 9mm Beretta semiautomatic pistol.\n\nInitially, I thought it would only be the two of us at target practice. But by the time I\u2019d secured permission to shoot on private property just outside town, three other women had asked to participate: a UT administrator, a graduate student visiting from another institution, and Ana Lopez, an undergraduate student who co-founded Students Against Campus Carry. She\u2019d become a public face of the resistance to campus carry, profiled in The New York Times and invited to the White House to meet with then\u2013Vice President Joe Biden. She\u2019d also been accused by gun rights advocates of not having the authority to debate campus carry because she didn\u2019t have experience shooting guns. She intended to negate that line of criticism by getting some range time.\n\nAs we bumped along a dusty road in the Texas Hill Country, the struts of my Volkswagen hatchback bucking under the weight of five passengers, four guns, and several boxes of ammunition, I was tempted more than once to call it off. Putting a gun in a student\u2019s hands seemed so obviously inappropriate that it needn\u2019t even be mentioned in the university\u2019s handbook of conduct. Or it used to seem that way, anyway.\n\nGeorge had brought her doctoral diploma, also from UT. With binder clips, we fixed it to a target in front of an earthen berm, along a creek lined with Texas live oaks. It hangs now in her office, where visitors ask about the bullet holes between the lines of calligraphy\u2014a prompt to discuss her office gun policy, in lieu of an overt sign.\n\nWhen Ana\u2019s turn came to shoot, I made her pause a moment as I checked again that the backdrop was clear. I glanced around to confirm everyone was wearing their ear plugs and safety goggles. \u201cOkay,\u201d I finally said. \u201cDisengage the safety.\u201d\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?"

    "text": "But besides the document\u2019s winks at the slang-riddled discussions of far-right message boards, the manifesto is far from ironic. In fact, for much of its eighty-odd pages, it is a deadly serious screed, promulgating some of white power\u2019s grounding myths and showcasing its most violent consequences. What it reveals is a familiar enemy that, for entirely pragmatic and propagandistic reasons, has dressed itself up in memetic ephemera.\n\nMuch of the manifesto\u2014which begins with the line, \u201cIt\u2019s the birthrates,\u201d repeated three times\u2014is fixated on reproduction, a classic preoccupation of white supremacist ideology. The author writes about his fear and rage at the thought of \u201cinvaders\u201d\u2014anyone nonwhite, but particularly Muslims\u2014outbreeding \u201cEuropeans.\u201d He claims, baselessly, that Muslims have preternaturally high birth-rates, and that the disparity between white and nonwhite births will lead to the crisis named in the manifesto\u2019s title: the \u201cGreat Replacement,\u201d an ethnic, cultural, and racial erasure. The theory was promulgated by the French racist ideologue Renaud Camus in a 2012 book of the same name; since then, it has spread through an international network of white supremacists.\n\nFrom its very first page, the manifesto proclaims its ideology in screaming capital letters: \u201cTHIS IS WHITE GENOCIDE.\u201d The text crawls with references to historical events and personages glorified by white supremacists, from the Crusades to the Roman emperor Elagabalus. The killer claimed to have been radicalized by the 2017 death of the young Swedish girl Ebba \u00c5kerlund, whose murder by an Uzbek migrant was covered extensively in the far-right press. And the text is sandwiched between images of the Sonnenrad, or Black Sun, which the Anti-Defamation League describes as \u201cone of a number of ancient European symbols appropriated by the Nazis in their attempt to invent an idealized \u2018Aryan/Norse\u2019 heritage.\u201d\n\nThroughout the text, it\u2019s clear that the cultural touchstones Tarrant finds most evocative aren\u2019t the fleeting, satire-laced symbols that typify the alt-right, such as Pepe, a cartoon frog adopted by neo-fascists as a satirical mascot. Instead, Tarrant exalts the pure-white past white supremacists have conjured up for Europe, and evokes the maudlin myths of nationalist agitprop. Europe, in his estimation, was once filled with noble white men fighting swarthy interlopers, from Medieval battles against Saracens to the 1683 Turkish siege of Vienna.* The manifesto incorporates poems by Rudyard Kipling and Dylan Thomas. At points, its syntax soars into a kind of faux-Romantic prose: \u201cAccept death,\u201d he advises his audience, \u201cit is as certain as the setting of the sun at evenfall.\u201d\n\nTarrant was also deeply immersed in the coarser rhetoric of the anonymous message boards 4chan and 8chan, and other online havens of white-supremacist sentiment. In the 8chan post that contained links to both the manifesto and a Facebook livestream of the killings, he wrote: \u201cWell lads, it\u2019s time to stop shitposting and make a real-life effort post.\u201d (\u201cShitposting,\u201d in internet-culture slang, is essentially making a ruckus online for the sake of making a ruckus, flooding message boards or social media with low-quality content.) The image he used to accompany his post was a long-circulating 4chan meme depicting an overly online Australian. And his war cry, before opening fire on worshipers, was a reference to a mega-popular YouTuber who goes by PewDiePie."

      "Andre Pagliarini"
    ],
    "text": "Back in Brazil, there are some concerns that Bolsonaro is confusing fleeting ideological affinities with strategic geopolitical realignment. He was widely pilloried in the Brazilian press, for example, for visiting CIA headquarters, a step no Brazilian president has ever taken\u2014for good reason, considering the CIA\u2019s role in Latin America since the 1950s. And Bolsonaro seemed blithely unconcerned by the fact that political winds in the United States might shift next year. During a joint press conference on Tuesday, Bolsonaro was asked how he would react if a self-avowed socialist were to beat Trump in the 2020 presidential election. \u201cWell, it\u2019s an internal matter. We will respect whatever the ballots tell us in 2020, but I do fully believe Donald Trump is going to be reelected.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro is betting the rest of his presidency on a continued partnership with Trump.\n\nWhile Trump has begun to ratchet up his rhetorical attacks on socialism in response to its rising appeal among younger voters and within the Democratic party, Bolsonaro has been railing against it for years, proclaiming that the mild center-leftism of the Workers\u2019 Party that governed Brazil for thirteen years was leading the country to an authoritarian abyss. \u201cEvery day,\u201d he declared at the White House on Tuesday, \u201cmore and more people that are prone to socialism, and even communism, slowly are going to be opening their minds to the reality. And you can see the border with Venezuela and Brazil was recently closed\u2014not for Brazilians, which are pro-socialism, to go into Venezuela, but the other way around, so that Venezuelans who support democracy wouldn\u2019t go into Brazil. This feeling most certainly is going to be very much seen when 2020 comes.\u201d Through Bolsonaro\u2019s fanciful assessments of the political landscape in Brazil, which he argues is largely controlled by nefarious \u201ccultural Marxists\u201d despite the fact that he handily won a national election on a campaign defined by homophobia, belligerence, and racism, a strategy begins to emerge: Bolsonaro is betting the rest of his presidency on a continued partnership with Trump.\n\nThis gamble is due primarily to the paranoid conspiratorial worldview both men share. They mostly agree on the problems facing the world and how to solve them. But Bolsonaro may also have little choice but to cling to his U.S. analogue: He has become so internationally reviled so quickly that finding willing partners going forward may prove difficult. Since October of last year, Democrats have urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to denounce Bolsonaro\u2019s most egregious statements. In a major foreign policy speech at Johns Hopkins University, Bernie Sanders included Bolsonaro in a global far-right wave of \u201cdemagogues who exploit people\u2019s fears, prejudices and grievances to gain and hold on to power.\u201d Sanders has also established close ties with Fernando Haddad, the Workers\u2019 Party candidate Bolsonaro defeated in the 2018 elections. Bolsonaro, in other words, will likely not find a friendly ear should the Democrats win the presidency. While becoming a pariah would obviously not be in Brazil\u2019s best interest, Bolsonaro\u2014along with his foreign minister, as I have argued elsewhere\u2014has shown little willingness to soften his rhetorical edges for foreign audiences.\n\nThis is why, rather than adopt a diplomatic approach to the current occupant of the White House, seeing him as a temporary partner, Bolsonaro instead treats Trump as a life jacket. As long as he has an ally in Washington as reactionary and aggressively ignorant as Trump, Bolsonaro will have the latitude to pretend his administration has influence at the highest echelons of global power. If, instead, the tide is turning on Trumpism and the 2020 election results reflect that, Bolsonaro may very well be held accountable abroad for his hyperviolent rhetoric.\n\nSome of Bolsonaro\u2019s critics, particularly those on the left, argue that it doesn\u2019t matter who the U.S. president is\u2014Brazil will always be placed in a junior position and taken advantage of by the world\u2019s hegemonic power. It is true that the United States has never treated Brazil with the respect Brazilians feel they deserve as a large democracy with a diverse population, an appealing and vibrant national culture, and abundant natural resources. But wholeheartedly embracing an American president as erratic as Trump is more risky for Brazil than a balanced posture would be, one that would give Brazilian policymakers room to maneuver should the political situation in Brazil and the world begin to change."

    ],
    "text": "All of this leads many to conclude that a simple calculus governs political power in America: When Democrats move to the center, they win; when they move to the left, Republicans do. So it\u2019s no wonder that, given all the talk of Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, some Democrats are once again pleading for moderation.\n\n\n\nPerhaps thinking of his own battle with Ted Kennedy, Carter has counseled Democrats to focus on independents rather than progressives. \u201cIndependents need to know they can invest their vote in the Democratic Party,\u201d Carter told an audience at his presidential library in September, going on to caution that consequences would follow were they to \u201cmove to a very liberal program, like universal health care.\u201d Although the party picked up 40 seats in a landslide midterm election, the amount of attention given to new progressive policies, like Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal, Sanders\u2019s Medicare for All, and Elizabeth Warren\u2019s wealth tax and anti-trust plans, continues to make Democrats apprehensive.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re caught in a lose-lose because the activists are completely paying attention to Alexandria. And so if we aren\u2019t supporting it, then we\u2019re seen as bad Democrats,\u201d Hill, the Democratic congresswoman from California, told Politico. \u201cBut if we do support it, then that\u2019s going to be damaging to our campaigns.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the solution to this bind? Delaware Senator Chris Coons told The New York Times it was to be \u201chopeful, optimistic, positive.\u201d Third-term Pennsylvania Congressman Brendan Boyle said \u201cthere\u2019s still lots of folks on our side who are O.K. with compromise,\u201d pointing to the many center-left Democrats who won seats in the midterm elections. Above all, the answer appears to be to keep quiet about specifics, as Beto O\u2019Rourke has done, distancing oneself from universalist programs like Medicare for All and instead speaking in vague generalities about access and affordability. A fear of appearing too liberal has led these and other Democrats to be wary of standing for anything.\n\n\n\nBut the Democratic Party is moving left, whether they like it or not. Forty-six percent of Democrats and Democrat-leaning voters now identify as \u201cliberal,\u201d up from just 28 percent a decade ago. At the same time, the percentage of people identifying as \u201cmoderates\u201d has fallen from 44 to 37. When Obama was elected, one could accurately describe the Democratic base as being moderate, but that\u2019s no longer true anymore. As The Atlantic\u2019s David Graham wrote last year, registered Democrats have become more liberal on immigration, economics, and race over the same period. Increasing taxes on the rich, Medicare for All, and a jobs guarantee all poll well today.\n\n\n\nDemocrats did not gain their current momentum by being timid, but by relentlessly criticizing the president and advancing bold new ideas. Trump is the most consistently unpopular president in recent American history, and is underwater in the polls in key primary states. His approval rating may worsen yet after special counsel Robert Mueller releases his report and House Democrats\u2019 investigations begin to bear fruit.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the sky is falling\u2014just not on the Democrats."

    ],
    "text": "\u201cWho are you people?\u201d the real Wilsons ask. The answer? \u201cWe are Americans.\u201d\n\nThere are many ways to interpret the sudden arrival of doppelg\u00e4ngers hell-bent on murder. As in Michael Haneke\u2019s Funny Games (1997), there is the sense that the Wilsons simply deserve to be destroyed, because all bourgeois families are in possession of riches and comfort that are not rightfully theirs. The shadow-Wilsons are identical in appearance to their counterparts, though evil of eye and ragged of speech (only shadow-Adelaide can speak, the others growl). The dichotomy suggests that every happy American family exists at the expense of another family, like the other in all ways except social circumstances.\n\nDoubles are often introduced to push the protagonists into an identity crisis, such as in Ingmar Bergman\u2019s Persona, Charlie Kaufman\u2019s Adaptation, Darren Aronofsky\u2019s Black Swan, Duncan Jones\u2019s Moon. But the story that resonates most strongly with the shadow-people of Us is J.M. Barrie\u2019s 1911 novel Peter Pan. As you might remember, Peter loses his shadow when a window shuts suddenly after he leaps through it, severing it from him. The children\u2019s nanny doesn\u2019t know what to do with it: \u201cunfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the window; it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the house.\u201d Neither does Peter:\n\nIf he thought at all, but I don\u2019t believe he ever thought, it was that he and his shadow, when brought near each other, would join like drops of water; and when they did not he was appalled. He tried to stick it on with soap from the bathroom, but that also failed. A shudder passed through Peter, and he sat on the floor and cried.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the very saddest moments in a very sad story. But it\u2019s precisely the same unnameable grief that hovers between Adelaide and her shadow when they meet. Wendy eventually sews Peter\u2019s shadow back on, but the Wilsons have no such luck\u2014they will have to fight the severed shadows for the right to exist.\n\nThe notion of a person\u2019s \u201cshadow\u201d has also been examined extensively by postcolonial theorists. In Franz Fanon\u2019s Black Skin, White Masks, he writes of the \u201cManichaean delirium\u201d that buzzes through a colonial society, where existence is split into subaltern suffering and the colonizer\u2019s ease. A kind of madness spreads through such a society, he writes, a neurosis that affects the haves and the haves-not alike, because they are bound together in a horribly anxious dyad.\n\nAmerica is not a colony like Algeria, but its economic and racial inequalities (which overlap to a large degree) have fashioned society into distinct strata: the privileged and the others. (It is worth noting here that Us can be read as \u201cU.S.\u201d) If in an unequal society the poor and the disenfranchised always exist as a shadow double to the rich, then the severing of the link may result in a traumatic shattering of the privileged person\u2019s sense of herself.\n\nThis is what happens to Adelaide and her family; the shadow-Adelaide, credited as Red, calls her family\u2019s appearance in the normal world \u201cThe Untethering.\u201d Playing both Red and Adelaide, Lupita Nyong\u2019o must establish both characters as distinct entities. As Adelaide, Nyong\u2019o\u2019s prettiness reads as maternal and decorative. But as Red, the smooth curves of her face and eyes become dead and unresponsive as a porcelain doll.\n\nBut the Wilsons do not collapse so easily, and this is where Peele expands upon the political critique that he formed in Get Out. Held together by strong bonds of love and African American identity (Gabe wears a Howard sweatshirt throughout the movie, and the family groove together to \u201cI Got 5 On It\u201d in the car), the Wilsons (spoiler alert) outlive countless white people whose doubles easily slaughter them.\n\nIf the postcolonial theoretical framework of Us is the right one, then it makes sense that African Americans would be the citizens who know enough of subaltern existence to be able to survive their shadows\u2019 attacks. They would be, themselves, shadow people, haunted by the profound certainty that oppressors cannot exist without those who are oppressed.\n\nIt would ruin the movie to explain exactly how The Tethered (as the shadow people are called) came to exist, and why they attacked the rest of humanity, but suffice it to say, the explanation does not match up to the sophisticated and funny exploration of identity that the rest of the movie presents. It\u2019s an answer that shuts down the possibilities of its own question, and it\u2019s the one truly disappointing moment in Us.\n\nStill, Us is an uncanny movie, and an implicit riposte to the questions Peele himself asked in Get Out. What if there\u2019s no easy ending? What if the real struggle takes place within? In the tradition of some of this country\u2019s finest authors on race and politics, Peele pushes the conversation forward."

    "authors": [
      "Matt Ford"
    ],
    "text": "Nunes\u2019s claim for damages also doesn\u2019t hold up. He says that Twitter bears legal responsibility for any defamatory posts made on its platform. In reality, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act generally shields websites from civil liability related to third-party content on their platforms. Nunes himself should be pretty familiar with this: As Reason\u2019s Elizabeth Nolan Brown pointed out, he and his colleagues have been working to change Section 230 for this exact reason.\n\nNunes adopts a patriotic mien when it comes to the broader free speech issues at stake. \u201cAccess to Twitter is essential for meaningful participation in modern-day American Democracy,\u201d he told the court. \u201cA candidate without Twitter is a losing candidate. The ability to use Twitter is a vital part of modern citizenship. A presence on Twitter is essential for an individual to run for office or engage in any level of political organizing in modern America. This is because Twitter is not merely a website: it is the modern town square.\u201d\n\nThis paean to civic speech might be more convincing if Nunes didn\u2019t ask the court to force Twitter to \u201creveal the names and contact information\u201d behind four of the pseudonymous accounts. What\u2019s more, he also wants the court to \u201cpermanently enjoin and order Twitter\u201d to suspend Mair and the other accounts. Twitter is a vital part of modern American citizenship, Nunes says, and he wants the government to strip people of access to it for being mean to him.\n\nBut Americans have every right to mock and insult their elected officials. During the election of 1796, the first contested presidential race in the nation\u2019s history, Alexander Hamilton wrote a pseudonymous pamphlet that accused Thomas Jefferson of having an affair with an enslaved woman he owned. (The allegation later turned out to be true.) Jefferson\u2019s supporters jeered at John Adams as \u201cHis Rotundity\u201d and called him a hermaphrodite, while Adams\u2019s camp accused Jefferson of supporting prostitution and incest. Adams later arrested one of Jefferson\u2019s pamphleteers during the election of 1800 and tried to prosecute him under the Alien and Sedition Acts. The American tradition of salacious and spurious political attacks is alive and well in the Trump era.\n\n\n\nThe New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, a Supreme Court case from 1964, set a formidable threshold for defamation claims by public figures like Nunes. The justices cited a \u201cprofound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open,\u201d even if it includes \u201cvehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\u201d The tweets against Nunes appear to fall well within those bounds. But Nunes ignores that landmark ruling (perhaps because, like Justice Clarence Thomas, he would like to see Sullivan overturned). Instead, he cites a smattering of other cases to defend his \u201cfundamental constitutional interest and entitlement to the uninterrupted enjoyment of his reputation.\u201d One of his longest citations isn\u2019t from law, but a passage from Shakespeare\u2019s Othello in which Iago bemoans that \u201che that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him, And makes me poor indeed.\u201d\n\nSo why embark on what appears to be a doomed legal endeavor? Perhaps Nunes genuinely believes he\u2019s the victim of a conspiracy theory by Democrats and America\u2019s foreign adversaries. If there\u2019s evidence to support this, Nunes doesn\u2019t offer it. \u201cThe full scope of the conspiracy, including the names of all participants and the level of involvement of donors and members of the Democratic Party, is unknown at this time and will be the subject of discovery in this action,\u201d he noted in the complaint. In other words, Nunes wants to go on a fishing expedition to satiate his political grievances, and he wants the courts to light the way.\n\nOr maybe Nunes is trying to use the legal system to get revenge on his political opponents. Defending oneself against litigation is onerous even for those with the financial means to fight back. (Mair urged her Twitter followers on Monday night to donate to her legal defense fund.) The rich have always wielded the American legal system as a cudgel against critics, as Peter Thiel did in financing the Hulk Hogan lawsuit that ultimately killed Gawker. That a member of Congress would attempt to do so is deeply disturbing.\n\nNunes\u2019s largely anonymous Twitter critics cast him as a shameless partisan hack\u2014someone who abuses power and the legal process to injure his political opponents, who plays fast and loose with the truth to advance partisan goals, and who\u2019s prone to conspiratorial thinking on the flimsiest of grounds. They say he lacks the temperament and honor to serve on the House Intelligence Committee and safeguard the nation\u2019s secrets. His lawsuit only proves them right."

    "text": "Refusing money from the oil, gas and coal industries may seem, at first glance, like a politically risky move. If the eventual Democratic nominee is to beat Donald Trump\u2014the most likely eventual Republican nominee\u2014they\u2019ll need all the resources they can get. So why give up such a potentially huge source of revenue?\n\n\n\n\u201cThe fossil fuel industry doesn\u2019t generally have a major role in presidential elections on the Democratic side, and hasn\u2019t for awhile,\u201d said Sarah Bryner, the research director at the Center for Responsive Politics. Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, only got about $1 million from oil and gas interests over the course of her campaign; Barack Obama received about the same amount in 2008 and 2012, respectively. That\u2019s a fairly minuscule amount, given that Clinton\u2019s campaign raised about a $1 billion and Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign raised even more. Even a Democratic candidate like O\u2019Rourke, who\u2019s historically benefitted from oil and gas industry money, wouldn\u2019t be giving up that much if he gave it up in 2020. As a congressman in 2018, he received $476,000 from the industry, second only to Senator Ted Cruz in all of Congress. But O\u2019Rourke raised $6 million online in the first 24 hours of his campaign alone.\n\nSo the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge isn\u2019t very costly for Democrats. (The No Hollywood Celebrity Money Pledge would be another story.) And any money a Democratic candidate gives up by signing is more than offset by the credibility they\u2019d earn on the issue of climate change\u2014not to mention that it might attract big-money environmental donors. The eventual Democratic nominee surely will be expected to champion the Green New Deal, or a similar plan to transition the country\u2019s fossil fuel economy into a renewable one. Democratic voters ought to be able trust that their nominee isn\u2019t corrupted by the very industries that are making the planet unlivable.\n\nThe Democratic field is large, and nearly every candidate has made a grand statement or two about the dire threat of global warming. But right now, voters can truly trust only five of them to decarbonize the economy. Bryner expects that to change, eventually. \u201cThis is a signaling game, and it ends up punishing candidates who won\u2019t make the same pledges,\u201d she said. Hopefully it does\u2014because if the next president doesn\u2019t have the guts to stand up to the fossil fuel industry, then they certainly don\u2019t have what it takes to prevent a world of hurt.\n\n* A previous version of this article misstated the organization that is administering the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge."

    "text": "Trump and the establishment are one in assuming that the United States must maintain global military dominance, regardless of circumstances, forever. It is long past time to question this assumption, and today only the rising left possesses the dynamism and independence to do so. In order to stand for peace, systematically not episodically, the left should oppose armed supremacy as a perpetual goal of America\u2019s foreign policy. For permanent armed supremacy produces permanent armed conflict. And its burdens are mounting.\n\nWolfowitz and his Pentagon colleagues originally justified their focus on primacy by claiming that it would bring peace. In a draft of their report, called the Defense Planning Guidance, they argued that the United States should seek a preeminence so overwhelming as to prevent any potential rival from even \u201caspiring to a larger regional or global role.\u201d After a public outcry, the final language was softened. But at least policymakers back then felt some compunction to demonstrate that Pax Americana would live up to its name.\n\nDecades later, the opposite has transpired. America spends more on defense than the next seven countries combined, with roughly 800 bases ringing the globe, yet its might has not prevented China from rising nor Russia from asserting itself, and may have antagonized both. Instead of cowing others into peace, primacy has plunged America into war. It has forced the United States to resist any significant retraction of its military power, lest it lose influence relative to anyone else. The endless wars are endless because the United States has appointed itself the world\u2019s \u201cindispensable nation,\u201d in Secretary of State Madeleine Albright\u2019s formulation, responsible less for ensuring its own safety than for maintaining its material and moral privilege to police the world. The costs include 147,000 lives in Afghanistan and $5.9 trillion for a war on terror that has stretched on since 2001, according to Brown University\u2019s Costs of War Project.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, armed primacy may well have allowed Trump to rise in the first place. To justify America\u2019s massive commitment of resources around the world, leaders have routinely claimed that foreigners are going to kill us. Trump took those inflated threats and ran with them, turning fear of deadly foreigners into the basis for his movement. That fear dates back to the second term of George W. Bush, when the xenophobia he directed toward distant \u201cIslamofascism\u201d turned inward. White supremacists rallied against immigrants at the border; nativists spread conspiracy theories that Sharia law was subverting American society. Now Trump has birthered his way to the White House, surrounded by a national security adviser and secretary of state who indulge rank Islamophobia. (John Bolton and Mike Pompeo have ties to Frank Gaffney, the author of such manifestos as \u201cThe Muslim Brotherhood in the Obama Administration.\u201d)\n\nTo be sure, many advocates of American primacy did not wish for this to happen. But it has happened. We face a world beset by war and awash in nationalism and nativism\u2014our own included. And as other powers rise, the costs of pursuing primacy will rise with them."

Cousins is particularly keen on returning to places of joy, of preindustrial purity and innocence. We are thus treated to an old postcard of the Sheffield Hotel in Grand Detour, Illinois, which Welles\u2019s father had owned, and which later burned in a fire. Grand Detour was a place that Welles once held dear, perhaps even regarded as a \u201cfirst love,\u201d calling it \u201cone of those lost worlds, one of those Edens that you get thrown out of.\u201d Cousins is quick to compare it to the \u201csnowy Eden\u201d of young Charlie Kane, shouting with glee outside Mrs. Kane\u2019s Boarding House, bundled up in his muffler and pulling his Rosebud sled behind him.

But \u201cparadises don\u2019t last,\u201d insists Cousins, as he shows us the squalor that\u2019s taken root on the same street corner where the RKO studio, home of that sound stage on which the winter wonderland was created, once stood.\n\nIn each of its five parts, The Eyes of Orson Welles conjures up key episodes, set pieces, and ur-scenes from a life on screen and off. For her influence on his political beliefs, there was no single more important figure to Welles than his mother Beatrice, who co-founded the Women\u2019s Alliance in Chicago to help the city\u2019s underprivileged, was an activist in the Unitarian Church and was the first woman in Welles\u2019s hometown of Kenosha, Wisconsin to be elected to public office. Cousins recognizes the imprint of Beatrice, who took her young son to see Nanook of the North (1922) but who died when Orson was just nine, the same year that he began to paint. Later in the documentary, which he admits could really be about Beatrice, Cousins spots a photo portrait tucked away in one of the domestic scenes of Kane, that bears an uncanny resemblance to Beatrice.\n\nWelles\u2019s own activism first took root on the stage, in collaboration with radical artists like Marc Blitzstein on The Cradle Will Rock and in his all-black adaptation of Macbeth in Harlem, as well as in his radio work. Cousins includes an especially poignant sequence from It\u2019s All True, an unfinished film that Welles shot in Brazil in the early 1940s. We see a string of close-ups, almost in the style of the early Soviet masters, of simple folk, old and young, photographed straight on and in profile, solo and in groups, with a level camera and in a low tilt; in the background we hear the disembodied voice of Welles delivering his 1942 \u201cHello Americans\u201d address on CBS radio. The radio address, no less timely today than it was in wartime America, is a paean to common humanity (\u201cit\u2019s out of those differences that culture grows,\u201d Welles contends). At one point, a small girl is shown crying and an arm from off screen reaches over and consoles her. Cousins wonders whether it might be the arm of the director.\n\nWelles\u2019s views were not terribly fashionable in his day. After giving political speeches on the value of progressive education and social justice during the early McCarthy years, he received bundles of hate mail (Cousins reads excerpts from the letters) and landed a spot on the Security Index kept by J. Edgar Hoover. When an African-American Army veteran named Isaac Woodard, a man who had earned distinction for his service in World War II, was beaten by a police officer and left blind in the process, Welles sketched a portrait of him as his own personal memorial. In a radio speech, he suggested that the nameless and faceless police officer, who inflicted his violence with impunity, had brought \u201cthe justice of Dachau and Auschwitz\u201d to America. A few years later, when asked why he changed the ending of Kafka\u2019s source novel, in which the protagonist Josef K. dies like a dog, for his more anarchic cinematic adaptation of The Trial, Welles said he couldn\u2019t bear it after Auschwitz. \u201cI am not Jewish,\u201d he added, \u201cbut we are all Jewish since the Holocaust.\u201d\n\nWelles was certainly not without his faults. Cousins spends ample time on his three wives and many lovers, and although Welles may have had a self-described penchant for chivalry and honor, as he told an interviewer in the 1960s, he also had a tendency to stray and to follow his unbridled passions wherever they might lead him. A revealing telegram he once sent to a hurt lover read, simply: \u201cPLEASE FORGIVE ME.--Orson.\u201d Occasionally, Welles comes off, almost like his character Harry Lime in Carol Reed\u2019s The Third Man (1948), as \u201ca smirker in the limelight.\u201d Cousins includes a clip from the film, in which Lime cynically rattles off the outstanding artistic achievements made in Renaissance Italy under the corrupt and bloody rule of the Borgia family, in harsh contrast to the five hundred years of peace and democracy in Switzerland, which produced nothing more than the cuckoo clock."

    "text": "It\u2019s easy to see the appeal of a one-and-done presidency. Biden\u2019s age, like that of the 77-year-old Bernie Sanders, undoubtedly would be a concern for some Americans, given the erratic and seemingly cognitively impaired septuagenarian currently in the White House. Promising to serve only one term could reassure voters concerned about the fact that Biden (and, for that matter Sanders) would become America\u2019s first octogenarian president before the end of his second year in office.\n\n\n\nAnd teaming up with Abrams, who energized the party during an unsuccessful bid for governor of Georgia, could show he has evolved on race and women and potentially inoculate himself from further criticism. It would be a salve, as New York\u2019s Jonathan Chait argued, for \u201cBiden\u2019s cringe-inducing and sometimes ghastly history of retrograde positions on segregation and criminal justice,\u201d would energize Democratic voters, and \u201cwould make Biden\u2019s race feel more serious.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut it\u2019s worth taking a moment to revisit that cringe-inducing and sometimes ghastly history. Biden, as Ryan Cooper wrote in The Week, was one of the Democrats who \u201cpushed the party away from Civil Rights.\u201d Biden embraced anti-integration measures early in his career in the Senate, becoming what Politico termed \u201ca leading anti-busing crusader\u201d in the 1970s. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Biden was one of the most vehement anti-crime crusaders in the Senate, pushing increasingly draconian punishments. Biden \u201cwasn\u2019t trying to compromise with the Republicans\u201d on crime, Ta-Nehisi Coates told New York magazine recently, but \u201cto get to the right of Republicans.\u201d\n\n\n\nBiden did so proudly. \u201cQuite frankly, the president\u2019s plan is not tough enough, bold enough, or imaginative enough to meet the crisis at hand,\u201d he said in 1989 about a crime bill being pushed by President George H. W. Bush. \u201cIn a nutshell, the president\u2019s plan does not include enough police officers to catch the violent thugs, enough prosecutors to convict them, enough judges to sentence them, or enough prison cells to put them away for a long time.\u201d In the Senate, Biden backed mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, civil forfeiture, and the death penalty. He bragged that one Democrat-backed crime bill in 1992 did \u201ceverything but hang people for jaywalking\u201d; two years later he would be a principal author of the 1994 crime bill that exacerbated mass incarceration.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tendency now to talk about Joe Biden as the sort of affable if inappropriate uncle, as loudmouth and silly,\u201d sociologist Naomi Murakawa told the Marshall Project in 2015. \u201cBut he\u2019s actually done really deeply disturbing, dangerous reforms that have made the criminal justice system more lethal and just bigger.\u201d Biden recently apologized for this stain on his record, saying \u201cI haven\u2019t always been right. I know we haven\u2019t always gotten things right, but I\u2019ve always tried.\u201d\n\n"

    "text": "Other states did not immediately follow suit. But in 2007, the Virginia Tech massacre led to the formation of the group now called Students for Campus Carry, which quickly gained membership and attention nationwide. With support from SCC\u2014and, to a lesser extent, the NRA\u2014dozens of campus-carry bills were introduced in statehouses over the proceeding decade, many only passing after a second or third legislative session. Other states, such as Colorado and Oregon, adopted campus carry when universities lost court battles with gun rights advocates. Today, a complex patchwork of state laws makes it difficult even to say with clarity how many \u201ccampus carry\u201d states there are. (Eleven have permissive laws similar to Utah\u2019s; 16 ban guns completely; and 23 at least nominally allow guns on campus, but with more stringent restrictions and various caveats.)\n\nThe ostensible goal of campus carry was to empower armed civilians on college campuses to defend themselves and others from mortal danger. That has not yet happened. \u201cCampus carriers have not intervened in any incident anywhere in the country on a campus,\u201d said Stephen Boss, a professor of environmental dynamics and sustainability at the University of Arkansas.\n\nFor his new book, College Homicide: The Case Against Guns on Campus, Boss examined every campus homicide in the United States between 2001 and 2016. He found no direct interventions by campus carriers, and no deterrent effect. Murders are rare on campuses that allow concealed carry, but no rarer than on college campuses where guns are banned. \u201cUtah did pretty well for eight years,\u201d he said, \u201cand then a student shot himself [in the leg] at Weber State University in 2012, and then in 2016, \u201917, and \u201918, the last three years consecutively, there\u2019s been a murder with a gun on the campus of the University of Utah, Salt Lake. So their luck\u2019s run out.\u201d\n\n\n\nProfessors at the University of Texas at Austin are no longer allowed to post signs like this one. Jay Jenner/Austin American-Statesman via AP\n\nIn 2015, during the one-year window the Texas legislature allotted schools to prepare for campus carry, UT Austin hosted two public forums about the implementation. At one of these, I testified that the university should develop a protocol about what to do with guns left behind in bathroom stalls. (Should we bring them to lost and found? Call the police? Put an \u201cout of order\u201d sign on the door?) People laughed. A year later, students left guns in the women\u2019s bathrooms here twice in the same week. According to The Campaign to Keep Guns Off Campus, similar incidents have happened in Georgia and repeatedly in Kansas. And where there are guns, there will be accidents: An Idaho State professor shot himself in the foot during class, and an employee at the University of Colorado in Denver was trying to un-jam her gun when it went off, injuring herself and a coworker.\n\nIn addition to dealing with such accidents, campus-carry schools have spent millions adapting their physical infrastructure (installing gun safes, signage and metal detectors, for example), retraining staff, and replacing faculty members lost to attrition. Other instructors have changed their teaching practices by eliminating discussions of sensitive subjects that might raise tempers in the class, or by offering courses exclusively online, or even by holding office hours in bars or churches where guns are prohibited, rather than meet with armed students in their offices.\n\n\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the matter of campus suicide.\n\nThe late Allan Schwartz, a professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of Rochester, studied college suicide for the better part of two decades. In 2013, he published an article comparing suicide rates among college students with nonstudents. Using nationally representative data from 2007, he found that, among men age 18-24, the suicide rate was much lower\u2014about half\u2014for those enrolled in college. This, despite that fact that students and nonstudents attempt suicide at roughly the same rate (1.4 percent versus 1.8 percent).\n\nSchwartz considered various parameters that could account for the disparity, and became increasingly convinced that the single most consequential factor was access to guns. Students who lived on campus had a lower risk of suicide than those who lived off campus; those who were enrolled full time had a lower risk than those enrolled part time; those who stayed on campus continuously had a lower risk than those who went home for the weekends, and so on. The more time that students spent in an environment where guns were prohibited, the less likely they were to die by suicide.\n\nWhich wasn\u2019t surprising to mental health professionals. Decades of public health research have repeatedly demonstrated that access to guns increases the likelihood of a death by suicide. This is because over 80 percent of people who attempt suicide with a gun die as a result\u2014compared to less than 2 percent of those who use other common means, such as overdosing. And most people who attempt suicide and survive never make another attempt.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe more guns that are present, the higher the rates of suicide.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have no reason to think that the same sort of pattern wouldn\u2019t happen on college campuses that happens off college campuses\u2014the more guns that are present, the higher the rates of suicide,\u201d said Marjorie Sanfilippo, a psychologist at Eckerd College in Florida. To compare suicides at campus-carry schools and schools that prohibit guns, Sanfilippo has begun to survey the directors of college counseling centers across the country. So far, the results are stark: The campus-carry schools had significantly higher rates of both attempted and completed suicides. Sanfilippo acknowledges that her sample size thus far is very modest\u2014just 22 respondents. \u201cOf course, each one represents thousands of students,\u201d she said. She is planning to expand the scope of her research.\n\nLarge-scale research projects cost money, though, and when it comes to gun violence, the federal purse strings have been drawn tight for decades. Congress first threatened to defund the Centers for Disease Control in 1996 if it recommended any form of gun control. President Obama issued an executive order in 2013 instructing the CDC to identify priorities for gun violence research, and still the agency demurred. (Obama did get his report, but it was published by the National Research Council and was essentially an analysis of past research\u2014much of it decades old.) Language in last year\u2019s government spending bill softened the threat that gun research could imperil the agency\u2019s budget for injury prevention, but until funds are specifically allocated for gun research, the roadblock remains.\n\nAs long as the CDC avoids gun-related research, the institutions best equipped to study the issue are research universities, and they\u2019re about to receive a huge injection of funding for that express purpose. Over the next five years, the National Collaborative for Gun Violence Research plans to distribute up to $50 million from the RAND Corporation, specifically for academic research into gun violence. Sanfilippo is among the many researchers applying for support.\n\nMeanwhile, where campus carry has already been enacted, schools adapt. In 2016, UT Austin implemented a policy that allows faculty and staff members to prohibit guns in our offices. But we\u2019re only permitted to convey this rule verbally; we can\u2019t hang a sign saying, \u201cNo guns allowed.\u201d So my colleague George\u2014her nickname, as she resembles the Beatle\u2014came up with a work-around, which required the use of my 9mm Beretta semiautomatic pistol.\n\nInitially, I thought it would only be the two of us at target practice. But by the time I\u2019d secured permission to shoot on private property just outside town, three other women had asked to participate: a UT administrator, a graduate student visiting from another institution, and Ana Lopez, an undergraduate student who co-founded Students Against Campus Carry. She\u2019d become a public face of the resistance to campus carry, profiled in The New York Times and invited to the White House to meet with then\u2013Vice President Joe Biden. She\u2019d also been accused by gun rights advocates of not having the authority to debate campus carry because she didn\u2019t have experience shooting guns. She intended to negate that line of criticism by getting some range time.\n\nAs we bumped along a dusty road in the Texas Hill Country, the struts of my Volkswagen hatchback bucking under the weight of five passengers, four guns, and several boxes of ammunition, I was tempted more than once to call it off. Putting a gun in a student\u2019s hands seemed so obviously inappropriate that it needn\u2019t even be mentioned in the university\u2019s handbook of conduct. Or it used to seem that way, anyway.\n\nGeorge had brought her doctoral diploma, also from UT. With binder clips, we fixed it to a target in front of an earthen berm, along a creek lined with Texas live oaks. It hangs now in her office, where visitors ask about the bullet holes between the lines of calligraphy\u2014a prompt to discuss her office gun policy, in lieu of an overt sign.\n\nWhen Ana\u2019s turn came to shoot, I made her pause a moment as I checked again that the backdrop was clear. I glanced around to confirm everyone was wearing their ear plugs and safety goggles. \u201cOkay,\u201d I finally said. \u201cDisengage the safety.\u201d\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?"

    "text": "President Trump condemned the Christchurch attacks, but his administration has spent the last three years emboldening white nationalists and neo-Nazis, cracking down on left-wing activists, and mainstreaming anti-immigration conspiracy theories tinged with anti-Semitic undertones not dissimilar to those promulgated by Tarrant. In October, the president addressed an audience of supporters at a campaign rally in Houston, Texas. He prompted \u201cUSA!\u201d chants from the crowd when he declared himself a \u201cnationalist\u201d fighting against \u201cpower-hungry globalists.\u201d\n\nDuring the 2018 midterm elections, Trump maligned a U.S.-bound caravan of refugees and migrants as an \u201cinvasion,\u201d a conspiracy theory repeated by white nationalist Robert Bowers when he gunned down worshippers at a Pittsburg synagogue last November. The Christchurch shooter used eerily similar language in a blog post on Thursday: \u201cI will carry out an attack against the invaders,\u201d he wrote, apparently referring to Muslim immigrants.\n\nThe similarities are not going unnoticed. \u201cIn this case, a killer attacked Muslims worshiping at two mosques. In November, a killer massacred Jews at a synagogue in Pittsburgh,\u201d Cohen said Friday. \u201cThough the victims were different, and the attacks came in different parts of the world, the terrorists shared the same ideology of white supremacist hate.\u201d\n\nPerhaps even more disturbingly, however, far-right politicians from Australia to Europe responding to the attacks have doubled down on white nationalist rhetoric, shifting the blame from the killer to the Muslims targeted by the violence. Australia Senator Fraser Anning, who represents Queensland, condemned the attacks but used the opportunity to spread Islamophobic bile. \u201cThe real cause of bloodshed on the New Zealand streets today is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place,\u201d Anning wrote.\n\nHalfway across the world, Hungary\u2019s far-right Prime Minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, on Friday celebrated Hungarians for supposedly stopping \u201cat our southern borders, the migrant invasion directed at Europe.\u201d Orb\u00e1n has spent the last several years blaming Jewish Hungarian American billionaire philanthropist George Soros for Europe\u2019s refugee crisis. \u201cWithout the protection of our Christian culture we will lose Europe, and Europe will no longer belong to the Europeans,\u201d he added\u2014an uncomfortably close echo of Tarrant\u2019s death-struggle, us-versus-them manifesto language.\n\nIn the U.S. as well, President Trump called the attacks a \u201chorrible, horrible thing\u201d before quickly pivoting to the topic of immigration. \u201cPeople hate the word invasion, but that\u2019s what it is,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the wake of yet another deadly attack amidst a global rise in far-right violence, many in the coming days will understandably be wondering what an appropriate response should look like. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on leftists to work toward a clear internationalist platform that rebukes nationalism, rebukes hard borders, and rejects the notion that Europe is a white continent,\u201d Ross told me. The increasingly international nature of rightist extremism requires an equally international anti-fascist response that addresses its root causes. Until that response comes, and so long as the people occupying the corridors of power from North America to Europe and beyond spread the same messages once thought to be confined to the dark crevices of the internet, we can expect more bloodshed targeting immigrants, worshippers, and everyone opposed to hate.\n\nThis article has been updated to include President Trump\u2019s remarks in response to the attack."

    "text": "But the way to get people excited about a presidential candidacy is to be an exciting presidential candidate\u2014not to bait them about a potential run for months. America was tiring of his act: He began slipping in the presidential polls. Perhaps sensing he could drag this out no longer, he announced in late February that he had made a decision, and \u2026 well, he\u2019d reveal it at some point in the near future.\n\n\n\nThen he dragged it out for another two weeks.\n\n\n\nFinally, this week, O\u2019Rourke announced he was entering the race. Even this was a multi-day affair, culminating in a swing through Iowa where he gave his spoken-word pitch while standing on coffeeshop countertops. The rollout of his decision also included a fawning profile in Vanity Fair, complete with photographs from Annie Leibowitz. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know how much of it was me,\u201d he told Joe Hagan, sounding a bit like a band member in Almost Famous. \u201cBut there is something abnormal, super-normal, or I don\u2019t know what the hell to call it, that we both experience when we\u2019re out on the campaign trail.\u201d While other Democratic candidates have defined themselves by the policies they support, or their vision for the country, O\u2019Rourke spoke about the nomination as if it was his birthright. \u201cMan, I\u2019m just born to be in it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can probably tell that I want to run. I do. I think I\u2019d be good at it.\u201d He had less to say about whether he\u2019d be any good at running the country.\n\n\n\nTo be fair, some prominent people think he would be very good at it. People from Obama\u2019s orbit, in particular, have singled O\u2019Rourke out, giving credibility to the comparison. Though not a fan of his blogs, former Obama chief strategist David Axelrod has praised O\u2019Rourke repeatedly, noting his vision \u201ccomes from a belief that, through politics, we can achieve a higher purpose.\u201d Former Obama field organizer Lauren Pardi told NBC late last year that \u201cBeto has a special ability\u2014like President Obama did\u2014to make people believe in the best version of America.\u201d Obama himself made the comparison on Axelrod\u2019s podcast late last-year, noting that voters see a similar authenticity in the two. \u201cIt felt as if he based his statements and his positions on what he believed,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nBut the similarities largely end on that most ineffable political quality of authenticity. Obama launched his political campaign in 2007 by arguing that the bipartisan vote for the Iraq War was a historic mistake, that universal health care was a moral necessity, and that our economic system was dangerously inequitable. O\u2019Rourke lacks any platform whatsoever. He has no signature idea, and we know little about his political positions beyond the mushy centrism he exhibited in Congress. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s decision to spend the last five months blogging could be seen as an attempt to shore up another weakness: His lack of a particularly compelling biography. Spending one\u2019s twenties as an aimless musician, as O\u2019Rourke did, is hardly the stuff of Dreams of My Father.\n\n\n\nInstead, the biggest thing that O\u2019Rourke has in common with Obama, the 2008 candidate, is the belief that they can transcend a broken political system with lofty rhetoric about bringing people together. But when Obama spoke about healing divisions, millions of people believed him. And it still didn\u2019t work. Obama came to his senses while in office, as the Republican Party committed itself to bigotry and intransigence, and he now spends his political capital and energy on reforming our broken democracy. Many of the Democratic candidates for president have their own proposals for doing so. O\u2019Rourke just has a blog, and a big beautiful smile that some folks can\u2019t resist. It\u2019s as if the last ten years of American political life never happened."

    "title": "Making #MeToo Work in Pakistan",
    "authors": [
      "Farah Amjad"
    ],
    "text": "\u201cWhen we talk about #MeToo in Pakistan,\u201d said Mariam Durrani, a Pakistani-American anthropologist and feminist scholar at Hamilton College in New York, \u201cwe are still really exclusive in terms of the voices that are being included, there\u2019s a huge majority of Pakistanis who are not included.\u201d\n\nThe way this class-based feminism plays out has at times been discouraging. For example, it was the personal testimonies of women like Frieha Altaf, a socialite and CEO of a public relations company, that propelled #MeToo from the margins of the Pakistani digital sphere to its mainstream. Following the rape and murder of a seven-year-old girl named Zainab Ansari in January 2018, Altaf tweeted that she was sexually abused by her family\u2019s cook when she was six years old. Later, Atlaf launched her own spin-off of #MeToo, called #MainBhi (the Urdu translation of #MeToo), at that year\u2019s Lux Style Awards, Pakistan\u2019s largest entertainment and fashion awards ceremony. However, #MainBhi merely called on people to speak out about social injustice in general\u2014the #MeToo message diluted, perhaps, by the effort\u2019s corporate origins.\n\nAnother telling example involves pop star Ali Zafar, who has maintained his professional and celebrity standing despite being accused of harassment by prominent musician Meesha Shafi and many other women. Zafar\u2019s film Teefa in Trouble, released just months after the allegations came out in April 2018, was a box office hit. Zafar\u2019s co-star in Teefa in Trouble, a young actress who often talks about the need for more diverse and substantial roles for women in television, even defended Zafar, citing his family values as proof of his innocence. While young feminists in Lahore and Karachi protested outside of film theaters, elite feminists were largely silent. \u201cWhen faced with an actual #MainBhi moment, the vast majority of Pakistan\u2019s feminists, the most notable of whom tend to be among the country\u2019s elites, are choosing inaction, ambivalence, or silence,\u201d said the writer Rafia Zakaria.\n\nThat ambivalence is felt in politics, too. Shireen Mazari, Pakistan\u2019s minister for human rights, dismissed Gulalia\u2019s allegations against Imran Khan in 2017, even though her own daughter left Khan\u2019s party in 2012 due to the harassment she experienced there. Mazari resigned from the party that year in protest. Mazari ended up rejoining PTI, and in 2016 she was subject to the kind of gendered harassment and abuse that is all too common for female politicians in Pakistan. During a raucous parliament session, a federal minister called Mazari a \u201ctractor trolley,\u201d ridiculing her voice and appearance.\n\nThat Mazari dismissed Gulalia\u2019s claims despite her own personal experiences with harassment is as instructive as it is disheartening. \u201cOne of the defining characteristics of elite circles in Pakistan is that whenever an allegation of any sort, not even just sexual harassment, comes up against one of their own, they will definitely rally to his or her support, no matter how progressive they proclaim to be,\u201d said Hafsa Khawaja, a writer and recent graduate of the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS). \u201cI think that has been a major issue when it comes to #MeToo in Pakistan.\u201d\n\nStill, despite #MeToo\u2019s limits, the emergence of new online feminist movements has coincided with and encouraged a shake-up of how people advocate for women\u2019s rights in Pakistan. \u201c#MeToo merely served as a catalyst for what was already brewing here,\u201d said Alia Amirali, a leftist-feminist political worker and member of the Women\u2019s Democratic Front.\n\nAlthough the movement for women\u2019s rights and equality in Pakistan began in the early days of the country\u2019s creation in 1947, it has recently been dominated by an NGO-funded model of women\u2019s empowerment that became popular in the country in the 1990s. This model has contributed to ideological differences in Pakistani feminist thought, specifically between the two dominant forms, secular and Islamic. Scholars argue that secular feminists\u2019 \u201clack of clarity\u201d on the question of religion has allowed Islamic feminists and others to perpetuate the idea that secular feminists are importing Western ideas that conflict with Pakistan\u2019s Islamic and cultural values. And because many secular feminists come from elite and middle-class backgrounds, feminism is thus also seen as a project of the urban, liberal elites.\n\nMen in power often perpetuate and exploit such ideas to belittle feminist organizing and activism. After this year\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day on March 8, when thousands of women marched in rallies across Pakistan, popular television host and politician Aamir Liaquat Husain urged Imran Khan to open an investigation into the marches. \u201cWhere did they get the money from. ... Who was behind it?\u201d asked Husain in a video posted on Twitter. Other men were offended by the posters at the march, including one that read, \u201cKeep your dick pics to yourself.\u201d\n\nThe split among feminist activists is unfortunate, given that Pakistani women of all backgrounds are sympathetic to feminist ideas. Fauzia Husain, a PhD candidate in sociology at the University of Virginia, saw this in her fieldwork with lady health workers, many of whom come from working-class backgrounds. Husain told me that these women used \u201cthe most feminist language\u201d of those she surveyed, despite having little to no familiarity with feminist discourse. To the question of \u201cWhy women are treated like animals,\u201d one of the workers responded, \u201cWe\u2019re treated like this because of the men.\u201d\n\nThe feminist landscape in Pakistan has grown and changed in the past decade. Social media has empowered new feminist voices, organizations, and modes of organizing, while independent feminist organizations have emerged to challenge the dominance of NGO-funded groups. The Women\u2019s Democratic Front (WDF) was created in 2018 by feminists from the political left, and includes members of the Awami Worker\u2019s Party, which is based in Lahore. WDF has been using social media to promote its work in working-class and rural communities. In doing so, the organization has magnified the voices of women who have traditionally been neglected by feminist groups.\n\nMeanwhile, a growing Pakistani feminist presence on social media, particularly Twitter, has facilitated dialogue between feminists from different professional and ideological backgrounds. \u201cThe Essential Pakistani Women on Twitter\u201d list features a diverse set of Pakistani women, many of whom self-identity as feminists, including journalists, academics, activists, and engineers. These women, in turn, are actively contributing to global conversations about feminism, which are then translated back to address Pakistani concerns.\n\nThere are plenty of disagreements among the new feminist groups. #MeToo\u2019s focus on sexual harassment, for example, is a point of contention for WDF, which is more concerned with the systemic way in which patriarchy oppresses women in Pakistan. Some feminists are also wary of #MeToo\u2019s name-and-shame approach toward individual bad actors, which likewise may come at the expense of a grassroots, structural approach.\n\nBut those differences have not hampered dialogue and collaboration between the groups. Last summer, members of Girls at Dhabas and Women\u2019s Action Forum, one of the oldest independent Pakistani feminist groups, helped create a first-of-its-kind sexual harassment policy for educational institutions in Pakistan. The policy came in response to an ongoing sexual harassment problem at Cedar College, a private high school in Karachi. Because Pakistan has no laws on sexual harassment of students in educational institutions, schools often do not have means to protect students or address issues when they arise. The new policy provides an ample definition of sexual harassment and lays out policies and procedures that schools can use to investigate allegations. Cedar College signed on to the policy and is implementing it. The policy is now being circulated to other schools and universities across the country.\n\nOne of the co-writers of the policy was Hiba Thobani, a lawyer who worked on a sexual harassment case that provided a lot of momentum for #MeToo. Thobani spent three years helping a Karachi University assistant professor fight a sexual harassment case against a senior visiting faculty member, who also happens to be a prominent literary figure in the country. Through working on the case, Thobani saw how the processes laid out by the 2010 workplace harassment law were complicated by institutional inefficiencies and disregard for the pain and difficulties that the victims have to endure. The assistant professor\u2019s claims were investigated at least three times, there were instances of evidence tampering, and at one point, the ombudsperson overseeing the case was replaced on corruption charges. By the time that the final verdict came in favor of the victim in early 2018, Thobani had lost confidence in the process. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us saw it coming,\u201d she said. \u201cWe thought we would have to appeal to the high court, but we didn\u2019t need to because we got the verdict in our favor.\u201d\n\nThe case not only made the assistant professor an \u201cicon\u201d of #MeToo, but also sparked a larger examination of existing laws and policies on sexual harassment. Lawyers wrote op-eds in leading newspapers about the shortcomings of existing sexual harassment laws. The country\u2019s Supreme Court recently asked federal and provincial governments to simplify and strengthen existing laws and procedures concerning sexual harassment, specifically the 2010 workplace harassment law. This came as the result of efforts by the AGHS Legal Aid Cell, co-founded by the late-human rights lawyer and women\u2019s rights champion Asma Jahangir.\n\nOther feminists are spearheading efforts to make legal services more accessible to sexual harassment victims. The Digital Rights Foundation, run by a leading feminist voice Nighat Dad, recently launched a legal support platform for victims of sexual harassment. The platform, which enables victims to connect with pro-bono lawyers and counselors, was created in response to the legal retaliation that met complaints of harassment from working women and students.\n\nWhile efforts to reform existing sexual harassment laws have long been in the making, #MeToo has accelerated them. It has not only made feminists more aware of the legal challenges sexual harassment victims face, but also given them an opportunity to affect how those challenges are addressed. In this sense, #MeToo has at least given the problem a new shape. Fiza Khatri, who spearheaded Girls at Dhabas\u2019 work with Cedar College, admits that there is still so much more that #MeToo has to accomplish in Pakistan. \u201cWe haven\u2019t experienced #MeToo in full throttle. We\u2019ve experienced it in a burst. We know what works and what doesn\u2019t. We know what the challenges are.\u201d\n\nImran Khan\u2019s public rebuke of feminism has made the work of these feminists all the more urgent. \u201cIt\u2019s a really exciting time for sure,\u201d said Sadia Khatri of Girls at Dhabas. \u201cThe contradictions are real, but they are not to be feared I think. They\u2019re just part and parcel of living here, a country where patriarchy runs so, so deep.\u201d"

    "text": "Toronto gave Kenner his first great mentor: Marshall McLuhan, then an obscure professor incubating the media studies that would make him famous in the 1960s. McLuhan and Kenner shared a worldview that combined conservative politics with an enthusiasm for experimental literature. They saw the great modernist works as a balm for the alienation of modernity\u2014like a sip of brandy that could cure a hangover. This perspective had a religious component: McLuhan was a Catholic convert, and Kenner a self-described Catholic fellow traveler who would join the Church in 1964. Their turn toward Catholicism occurred as the Church, on the cusp of Vatican II, was gingerly making peace with modernity.\n\nHugh Kenner, photographed by Ralph Eugene Meatyard. The Photography Collection, Harry Ransom Center/The University of Texas at Austin, and the Estate of Ralph Eugene Meatyard/Fraenkel Gallery, San Francisco\n\nIt was in McLuhan\u2019s company in 1948 that Kenner met Ezra Pound, then incarcerated for alleged insanity in St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C. Pound, who had been the great impresario of modernism, writing its manifestos and closely nurturing the work of T.S. Eliot and many other writers, was then at the low point of his reputation, widely derided as a lunatic, a traitor, an anti-Semite, and a fascist. There was truth to most of these accusations: Pound had spent the war years making a series of deranged radio broadcasts, denouncing Jews, democracy, and the United States while also praising Mussolini\u2019s regime. But Kenner, who had a lifelong contrarian tendency to try and find the nugget of wisdom in cranks, fell under the spell of Pound\u2019s poetry and quickly became his leading advocate.\n\nUnlike Davenport, Kenner was never too shy to publish. When he and Davenport first met at a Columbia University panel discussion in 1953, Kenner already had two books under his belt (on G.K. Chesterton and Pound) and two more (on Wyndham Lewis and James Joyce) on the way. By 1958, the year in which Questioning Minds begins, Kenner, although only four years Davenport\u2019s senior, was much more firmly established in the literary world. Davenport was still a graduate student while Kenner was ensconced as head of the English Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and an important, if controversial, voice in literary criticism.\n\nCritics, especially liberal and leftist ones, treated the early Kenner with wariness. His intelligence was undeniable, but the anti-liberal undercurrent of his work rankled. Writing in Partisan Review in 1954, Irving Howe sneered, \u201cWhen a charlatan like Wyndham Lewis is revived and praised for his wisdom, it is done, predictably, by a Hugh Kenner in The Hudson Review.\u201d Stung by this hostility, Kenner cast about for allies. He found one in the form of William F. Buckley, whom he met at a party in 1957. Buckley and Kenner became tight friends, with Kenner emerging as a frequent contributor to Buckley\u2019s National Review.\n\nAs a conservative modernist, Kenner occupied a precarious position: Liberals distrusted him for his conservatism, conservatives for his modernism. During his tenure as National Review\u2019s poetry editor, Kenner had to fend off readers upset by the vers libre and left-wing politics of William Carlos Williams. \u201cNational Review has some of the dumbest readers in the world,\u201d Kenner lamented. The magazine, Kenner noted, had a \u201cstodgy tendency to equate conservatism with resistance-to-all-change-of-preconceptions.\u201d On the flip side, Denise Levertov withdrew a poem from National Review when she discovered the magazine\u2019s politics.\n\nIn his search for allies, Kenner set his sights on Davenport. His early letters work toward the twin goals of recruiting Davenport to join him at the University of California and to write for National Review. Davenport never took the job\u2014he settled for the University of Kentucky, nearer his South Carolina family\u2014but he did become one of the most prolific National Review essayists, even though he did not share the magazine\u2019s politics. (Davenport always voted Democratic, until Bill Clinton drove him into the arms of Ralph Nader in 1996; in his fiction, he took imaginative pleasure in exploring the ideas of the utopian socialist Charles Fourier.)\n\nDavenport the public writer was born in these essays. As National Review\u2019s jack-of-all-trades, he tackled everything from Tarzan to Tchelitchew, from Toulouse-Lautrec to Tolkien. This National Review writing formed the seedbed for The Geography of the Imagination (1981), the much-cherished Davenport collection that was a National Book Awards finalist in 1982. With characteristic slyness, Davenport enjoyed sneaking in praise of same-sex love and androgyny to the pages of William F. Buckley\u2019s magazine. (Though National Review wasn\u2019t always the most congenial home for Davenport\u2019s thoughts: In 1970, he wrote a review tracing back Hemingway\u2019s prose to Walter Pater\u2019s aestheticism. This was an idea Kenner would return to in his own work. But a National Review staffer scoffed and added a note at the beginning of the issue complaining, \u201cHe\u2019s comparing Hemingway to that purple faggot Walter Pater!\u201d)\n\nThe real drama of the Davenport-Kenner correspondence is to see two prickly, isolated minds start to flower in the warmth of mutual understanding. Time and again, Kenner can be seen prodding Davenport to turn his private passions into public art. Charmed by Davenport\u2019s Max Beerbohm\u2013style cartoons of writers, Kenner recruits him to illustrate two of his critical books, The Stoic Comedians (1962) and The Counterfeiters (1968). Impressed by ad hoc translations Davenport supplied in the letters, Kenner eggs him on to publish his quirky, sharp-worded translations of Archilochus and Sappho. \u201cCurious as it may sound, you are the first person who has ever encouraged me in my work,\u201d Davenport wrote Kenner in 1962.\n\nDavenport, for his part, turned Kenner into a much more daring writer. Kenner\u2019s pre-Davenport books are assertive but still operate under the conventions of normal scholarship. Having Davenport as a sympathetic reader, Kenner let loose his ambition to write books about modernism that mimic modernist literary techniques: They are nonlinear, boldly jumping from topic to topic, juxtaposing disparate scenes with the expectation that the reader will fill in the gaps. Kenner modeled The Counterfeiters and The Pound Era on Pound\u2019s Cantos, a fragmented epic that combines lyrical observation and radical juxtapositions with historical sweep. The Counterfeiters is a juggling act of a book that, under the umbrella of mechanical reproduction, links together Gulliver\u2019s Travels, the early computer designs of Charles Babbage, the impact of empiricism on bad poetry, Jorge Luis Borges, the evolution of Latin abstract nouns, Buster Keaton, Andy Warhol, and Alan Turing\u2019s speculations on artificial intelligence (among many other topics). The sum is the funniest book of literary criticism ever written.\n\nOne of the revelations of Questioning Minds is that Kenner freely mined Davenport\u2019s correspondence for ideas and phrases. The first chapter of The Pound Era presents a defense of Pound\u2019s translation of Sappho. Reading the letters, you can see how Kenner\u2019s book reworks Davenport\u2019s ad hoc explanation of the translation to Kenner. Davenport\u2019s lessons on working with torn papyrus lead to a key insight of The Pound Era, that the modernists used fragments the way archaeologists do, not as ruins to be mourned but as rich sources of knowledge.\n\nIn 1963, Davenport visited Ezra Pound\u2019s childhood town, Wyncote, Pennsylvania, and gathered stories about the last visit the poet ever made there. Davenport wrote this up in a beautiful letter, which, distilled, became the last paragraph of The Pound Era. None of this amounts to plagiarism. Not only did these borrowings have Davenport\u2019s approval, but the two men had also by then formed a mind-meld that made it impossible to separate out their thoughts. Asked by Davenport if he could write on topics Kenner had touched, Kenner responded, \u201cThere is no property in the things of the mind.\u201d Earlier, Kenner\u2019s friendship with McLuhan foundered when the media sage unjustly accused his disciple of stealing his ideas. In fact, Kenner had written up ideas developed together in conversation, with a lucidity McLuhan was incapable of. With Davenport, Kenner found a more congenial collaborator.\n\nOne of the enthusiasms Kenner and Davenport shared in the 1960s was for the architect and futurist Buckminster Fuller, who popularized the idea of synergy and coined the term \u201csynergetics.\u201d The word has now unfortunately passed into management consultant cant, but the friendship of Kenner and Davenport illustrates a truly remarkable kind of relationship. Writing to Davenport in 1963, Kenner tried out an idea, \u201cI am coming to think that the key to the Pound Era is the discovery of synergy.\u201d Modernism, by this account, was a vortex, a joining together of talent that created something greater than the sum of its parts. Hence Kenner\u2019s fascination with the synergistic event or happy collaboration: Pound\u2019s extensive editing of The Waste Land, Pound\u2019s use of Ernest Fenollosa\u2019s notes to reinvigorate the translation of Chinese poetry, even something as lowly as Pound buying the impecunious Joyce a new pair of shoes.\n\nWhile Davenport is chatty and revealing from the earliest letters, the tone of Kenner\u2019s correspondence goes through an important change as he grapples with the cancer of his first wife, Mary-Jo Kenner, in 1963 and 1964. Prior to that crisis, Kenner tended to be aloof and professional. During those years, Kenner was on a leave to teach at the University of Virginia, which allowed Davenport to make visits, and he became a source of comfort for the family. In his letters, Kenner opens up as never before, writing about such intimate matters as his decision, shared by his dying wife, to convert to Catholicism. After Mary-Jo Kenner died in December 1964, Davenport helped Kenner look after his five children during the funeral. John Kenner, who was ten at the time, told me, \u201cGuy Davenport once spent a weekend drawing with me, distracting me from my grief over my mother\u2019s death.\u201d\n\nAfter Davenport returned home from the funeral, Kenner wrote, \u201cHow wonderful to have you around: especially as your dealings and doings with the children have helped me to realize what an achievement that family is: and it is her achievement. They are, singly and collectively, her memorial. Everything perhaps perishes but tradition.\u201d With these words, Kenner is articulating the central theme of The Pound Era: the power of a living and creative tradition as a stave against loss. The Pound Era would be dedicated to the memory of Mary-Jo Kenner. Kenner remarried the following year, with Davenport as part of the groom\u2019s party and William F. Buckley as best man.\n\nTaking to heart Ezra Pound\u2019s injunction to \u201cmake it new,\u201d Kenner and Davenport wrote letters alive with fresh language. Here is Davenport\u2019s account of riding with a student on the back seat of a motorcycle on the way to New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art (with a nod to Davenport\u2019s military service):\n\nWith knees kissing, now this, now that entire flank of a taxi, we threaded fifty blocks of traffic. Only in mountain climbing or in firing 8\u201d Howitzers with a cold breech does one feel as helpless: life means nothing and everything. But I had a captive audience to lecture to, explaining the whole damn museum in three hours.\n\nHere he is describing Buckminster Fuller, briefly comparing him to a student named Robert Gallway (given the epithet Erewhonian, from Samuel Butler\u2019s novel Erewhon):\n\nHe\u2019s a dwarf, with a worker\u2019s hands, all callouses and squared fingers. He carries an ear trumpet, of green plastic, with world series 1965 printed on it. His smile is golden and frequent; the man\u2019s temperament is angelic, and his energy is just a touch more than that of the Erewhonian Gallway (champeen runner, footballeur, and swimmer). One leg is shorter than the other, and the prescription shoe worn to correct the imbalance comes from a country doctor deep in the wilderness of Maine.\n\nAnd here is Kenner trying to comprehend the cancer that would soon kill his first wife: \u201cWe are all dying, but at different rates.\u201d Questioning Minds is chock-full of countless sentences of like quality: chewy, savory, nutritious.\n\nSome of the more pernicious sides of Pound, however, also left a mark. In his letters, Pound liked to refer to languages with ethnic slurs (referring to Italian, for instance, as \u201cwop\u201d). Both Kenner and Davenport echo their master in this juvenile habit, a failure of the humanism that is the hallmark of their best work. It also mirrors one of the few significant failures of The Pound Era, the lack of full reckoning with Pound\u2019s anti- Semitism. Ezra Pound was a cyclops: a giant cursed with tunnel vision and easily blinded. Kenner and Davenport, frequently brilliant and at times blinkered, also belonged to the tribe of one-eyed geniuses.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know what Kenner, as a traditionalist Catholic, made of Davenport\u2019s bisexuality. In The Stoic Comedians, Kenner made a strange offhand jibe about \u201csodomy.\u201d In National Review, Kenner aligned himself with the socially conservative wing of the magazine, praising Joseph Sobran\u2019s book of essays against abortion, feminism, and gay rights. Davenport was formed in the pre-Stonewall world and wasn\u2019t public about his sexuality. But he didn\u2019t quite hide it either. It was more of an open secret. When he took up writing stories again in 1969, his work was unabashedly homoerotic, often dealing with the sexual awakening of queer boys. In his letters to Kenner, Davenport doesn\u2019t identify his boyfriends as such but certainly speaks of them with the same openhearted warmth that he uses for his girlfriends. And Davenport also wrote to Kenner about the love life of his gay friends, such as the poets Jonathan Williams and Ronald Johnson.\n\nEzra Pound was a cyclops: a giant cursed with tunnel vision and easily blinded. Kenner and Davenport also belonged to the tribe of one-eyed geniuses.\n\nKenner and Davenport never stopped being friends, but starting around 1975 their relationship cools. Letters become less frequent and more perfunctory. \u201cWe, you and I, are beginning to drift out of synchronicity,\u201d Davenport wrote Kenner in 1977. In his introduction to Questioning Minds, Burns speculates that \u201cperhaps as Davenport\u2019s homoerotic interests emerged in his fictions and in his drawings Kenner withdrew from contact with him.\u201d Arguing against this is Kenner\u2019s continued praise of Davenport\u2019s fiction; in 1996, Kenner wrote a rave review of Davenport\u2019s last story collection, The Cardiff Team, (even commending one homoerotic story for its \u201csexiness\u201d) as well as an affectionate introduction to Guy Davenport: A Descriptive Bibliography, 1947\u20131995.\n\nKenner\u2019s personal coolness and silence could perhaps have resulted from the fact that he and Davenport had just gone on separate career paths, with Davenport increasingly focused on creative work that precluded scholarly collaboration. Or it could have been a matter of aging. William F. Buckley also felt that in his last few years Kenner was becoming more distant. Whatever the cause of the diminished friendship, Davenport was left baffled and hurt. \u201cFrom Hugh I\u2019ve heard nothing,\u201d Davenport complained to the publisher James Laughlin in 1990. \u201cWe used to be the best of friends.\u201d\n\nIn 2002, Kenner wrote his last letter to Davenport. It reads in part: \u201cWe\u2019ve been separated for too long; here I am in the final months of my 79th year.\u201d Hugh Kenner died the following year; 14 months later, so did Guy Davenport. The penultimate sentence of The Pound Era is a quote from The Cantos: \u201cShall two know the same in their knowing?\u201d It\u2019s followed by a sentence first written by Guy Davenport in a 1963 letter, which Kenner got permission to appropriate: \u201cThought is a labyrinth.\u201d"

    "text": "As a result, the special counsel\u2019s inquiry may be Americans\u2019 best chance to understand an attack on their democracy. Mueller could wrap up his work sooner, later, or not at all. I wrote in April that if he is unable to complete the investigation because of political interference by the Trump administration, he has a duty to go public with his findings. That reasoning applies even if he wraps up the probe of his own accord. Mueller\u2019s silence is ethically, legally, and politically smart while the investigation is ongoing. But to keep quiet after it ends would be incompatible with a democratic society.\n\nUnder Justice Department guidelines, Mueller will provide a report to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein when he\u2019s done. It\u2019s unclear whether that moment is approaching. Bloomberg reported last week that Mueller is close to reaching a conclusion on the two main threads in the Russia investigation: whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin in 2016, and whether Trump himself obstructed justice through his firing of FBI Director James Comey and other efforts to undercut the investigation into election meddling. CNN disputed that account, quoting an unnamed Justice Department official who expected the inquiry to continue \u201cwell after the midterms.\u201d\n\nThough Mueller hasn\u2019t taken public steps ahead of the November midterms, there are signs that he hasn\u2019t been idle. Investigators continued to question associates of Roger Stone, the longtime Republican political operative, about his interactions with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the 2016 election. The special counsel\u2019s office reportedly met with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort nine times in the last four weeks. Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former personal attorney, also sat for multiple interviews with Mueller\u2019s team since Labor Day.\n\nWill Americans ever learn what they told Mueller? If he sticks with the practices of past investigations, maybe not. As Samuelsohn reported, Mueller\u2019s findings \u201cmay never see the light of day\u201d if he sticks to standard operating procedure. This may come as something of a surprise to Americans who remember independent counsel Ken Starr\u2019s lurid report on President Bill Clinton\u2019s relationship with Monica Lewinsky, which Congress used as the basis for Clinton\u2019s impeachment in 1998. But the law that gave Starr his independence is no longer in force, Samuelsohn noted. Because Mueller\u2019s powers flow through the Justice Department\u2019s internal rules, he has far less leeway to make reports available to Congress or the public.\n\nIn this case, silence would be untenable on multiple levels. First, the public needs to know the full extent of what Mueller has learned about Russian interference. He\u2019s already done some good work on this front with the Internet Research Agency indictment in February and the Fancy Bear indictment in July. Despite the president\u2019s habitual denials, those charges reaffirmed that the Russian government bore responsibility for what happened in 2016. And while it\u2019s unlikely any of the defendants will ever see a U.S. courtroom, the charges provide a common set of facts for the public to understand the depth and breadth of social-media manipulation during the election."

    ],
    "text": "The dots on this map from Environmental Working Group show areas where public drinking water was contaminated with either nitrates or trihalomethanes, a harmful chemical byproduct of the water treatment process. screenshot/ewg.org\n\nAgriculture\u2019s unsavory side-effects also plague the Mississippi River Valley. Colin Wellenkamp, the executive director of the Mississippi River Cities & Towns Initiative, said that communities in Arkansas down to the mouth of the Gulf of Mexico face the most serious nitrate issues, due to bioaccumulation of the nutrients in their water source. (While most nutrient pollution is released farther north, contaminants tend to travel south, where they accumulate and sit near the mouth of the Gulf.) Often, water-treatment facilities are too old to adequately filter out the chemicals. \u201cSome of my cities are facing serious infrastructure issues because that stuff\u2019s been neglected for so long,\u201d Wellenkamp said.\n\nThis map provided by NOAA shows how water pollution from farmland flows downstream into the Gulf of Mexico. Lime green areas indicate farmland. NOAA.gov\n\nThe West Coast isn\u2019t spared, either. \u201cIn some parts of California, like the Central Valley, you see both a combination of water-scarcity and water-quality problems, because of over-pumping or because of drought,\u201d Olson said. \u201cThey often, unfortunately, go hand in hand, so even if you have water, it\u2019s not fit to drink.\u201d\n\n\n\nFarther south, colonias\u2014which are unincorporated settlements near the Mexican border\u2014in Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico also frequently lack running water or sewer access. According to the Rural Community Assistance Partnership, approximately 30 percent of residents in colonias didn\u2019t have safe drinking water in 2015. Mary Gonzales, a Texas state representative, said the problem is compounded by inadequate wastewater infrastructure for the 253 colonias in her district. \u201cIf you can\u2019t flush your toilet and the septic system isn\u2019t an adequate one, the raw sewage comes out onto the street,\u201d she explained. \u201cThat\u2019s literally what happens.\u201d She added that current immigration rhetoric has complicated efforts to develop colonias, even though most of these communities are decades old and most residents are citizens.\n\nFixing rural water problems can be a costly prospect, but finding the money is often more a matter of political will. In Texas, one colonia needs $32 million to build basic wastewater infrastructure, which Gonzalez says is not an insurmountable sum. Nevertheless, help has not been forthcoming. In 2017, Texas Governor Greg Abbott used the line-item veto to defund the state\u2019s Colonia Initiatives Program. The state legislature also failed to renew the Economically Distressed Areas Program, which provided funding for infrastructure development. Gonzalez introduced a House Joint Resolution that would have created a constitutional amendment to fund the program through joint-obligation bonds. The bill failed.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m advocating funding for colonias, sometimes people don\u2019t even know there are thousands of communities who don\u2019t even have running water,\u201d Gonzales added. \u201cThese communities have been invisible for a long time.\u201d Colonias have long been subject to environmental injustice, but the rest of rural America\u2019s water problems are largely invisible, too\u2014not least to the government bodies responsible for solving them.\n\nA few months after President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, Kentuckians from Martin County were dealing with contamination\u2014but, they told NPR, they were hopeful for new federal spending that could help rebuild their water systems and their trust in government. Their hopes are echoed in other suffering communities. Many of the contamination problems facing rural America can be traced to old, broken, unreliable infrastructure like leaky pipes, clunky filtration systems, and backed-up sewers. Trump, of course, has promised to fix America\u2019s aging infrastructure: His plan is set to be released Monday.\n\nIf Trump really wants to help rural America, he\u2019d have to confront two facts. The first is that white, blue-collar workers aren\u2019t the only rural Americans who need assistance. Immigrant and Latino communities are also at the front lines of this crisis. The second is that rural water travails can\u2019t be solved without public funding: new public funding. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to put out a $200 billion infrastructure plan, and the $200 billion is coming from cuts or elimination of other domestic programs we depend on, it\u2019s not going to help anybody,\u201d Wellenkamp said.\n\nWellenkamp fears that Trump will choose to zero out community-development block grants, or water-pollution-control grant programs, in order to fund his bill. That fear makes sense: In 2017, Trump introduced a budget proposal that would entirely defund the USDA\u2019s water and wastewater loan and grant program. Though his administration later rescinded that proposal, it indicated an apparent lack of interest in or familiarity with the program\u2019s work.\n\nAnd though Trump\u2019s much-vaunted infrastructure proposal will reportedly set aside $50 billion for rural development, a leaked draft of the forthcoming plan makes clear that it may be nothing more than a boon for backers of privatization. \u201cThe Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) will be open for business for private firms to both manage and repair water infrastructure at taxpayer\u2019s expense,\u201d Michelle Chen recently explained at The Nation. \u201cIn addition, a credit scheme under the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act would provide more opportunity to private investors, by eliminating existing requirements that WIFIA funds be used for \u2018Community Water Systems.\u2019\u201d The private sector, with its success strictly tied to profit-making, should not be involved in utilities at all. But certainly when public water money doesn\u2019t even require those private water businesses to use it for, well, community water systems, then the chances those systems will improve is close to nil.\n\n\n\nTrump arrives for a rally in Huntington, West Virginia, last August, where he touted his to-be-released infrastructure plan. Saul Loeb/Getty\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, The Washington Post has reported that the White House\u2019s business-friendly infrastructure policy is being guided by a group of outside investors led by one of Trump\u2019s billionaire friends, the developer Richard LeFrak. This is consistent with the Trump administration\u2019s other business-policy priorities, like the Department of Labor\u2019s proposed tip-pooling rule, which would allow restaurant owners to plunder their workers\u2019 tips because owners know best how to distribute that money: In other words, Trump\u2019s definition of economic progress is to grow the bank accounts of wealthy interests on the backs of everyday Americans and, yes, let it trickle down. Given that there isn\u2019t much profit in running water to sparsely populated, low-income areas\u2014indeed, water boards in rural communities are already raising rates to try to make ends meet\u2014it\u2019s unclear how blindly funding the private sector would incentivize the massive rebuilding projects these communities desperately need. Why give out tips or vast government checks when you can \u201creinvest\u201d in yourself?\n\nIt\u2019s only too easy to doubt Trump\u2019s commitment to clean water. In addition to the above, the administration is openly hostile to the EPA, a stance that presents still more obstacles to drinkable water, and it at one point declared war on the USDA\u2019s water-infrastructure funds, which advocates aren\u2019t convinced the administration has really abandoned. \u201cIt would not stun me if they tried to take another crack at cutting substantially or even eliminating that funding,\u201d Olson said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of ironic that the administration that purportedly wants to protect rural citizens has proposed eliminating one of the most important programs that helps rural communities have safe water.\u201d\n\nAmerica\u2019s failure to provide basic necessities to its rural citizens punches significant holes in the exceptionalist narrative favored by the Trump administration. It\u2019s also a potentially life-threatening oversight. Rural Americans are already disproportionately more likely to die from cancer. Researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attribute the trend to a number of factors, including heavy tobacco use and obesity. But rural Americans also have to contend with inadequate public-health infrastructure: They\u2019re more likely to be uninsured, and rural hospitals and community health centers are closing at a steady clip. This leaves rural communities ill-equipped to cope with the consequences of drinking contaminated water\u2014assuming they can access water at all.\n\nThe \u201cDistressed Communities Index,\u201d from the Economic Innovation Group, shows more economically distressed areas in red. These areas tend to be rural, and are some of the same ones facing drinking water crises. Screenshot/eig.org\n\nIf water systems are not modernized soon, the changing climate will ensure yet more contamination, therefore increasing these disparities. A study published in the journal Science last year found that nutrient pollution flowing into the Mississippi River will likely increase as the climate changes, even if farmers don\u2019t increase the amount of fertilizer they\u2019re using. That\u2019s because global warming is expected to cause more extreme storms and intense precipitation in the Midwest and Great Lakes, including the upper Mississippi Atchafalaya River Basin. In other areas of the United States, climate change is expected to cause more intense droughts and therefore more water-supply challenges. Those places include the rural communities in California\u2019s Central Valley and south Texas.\n\nRural communities face a true nightmare scenario, and help isn\u2019t on the way. These sparsely populated and sometimes deeply isolated towns and counties are already gripping the threads of an unravelling social safety net. Though rural America is making some economic gains, it still drags behind urban centers, and the gap is only expected to widen under Trump. But future administrations could change this narrative if they have the political will. The solution is massive public investment in failing infrastructure. Not only would this resolve a serious public-health crisis, it would also create jobs: You can\u2019t fix rural America\u2019s water without workers. Those jobs could even be folded into a federal-jobs guarantee, providing families with income while ensuring them access to safe drinking water and wastewater systems. Finally, a universal expansion of U.S. health care would resolve the insufficiencies of a privatized system and allow rural people to seek treatment for the physical consequences of drinking dirty water.\n\nThose solutions won\u2019t come from the Trump administration. In fact, individuals in both parties may balk at such a significant expansion of government. But it is the responsibility of government to protect the common good, and the state of rural water systems proves that this is a responsibility state and federal governments have refused to take up for far too long."

    "text": "It\u2019s easy to see the appeal of a one-and-done presidency. Biden\u2019s age, like that of the 77-year-old Bernie Sanders, undoubtedly would be a concern for some Americans, given the erratic and seemingly cognitively impaired septuagenarian currently in the White House. Promising to serve only one term could reassure voters concerned about the fact that Biden (and, for that matter Sanders) would become America\u2019s first octogenarian president before the end of his second year in office.\n\n\n\nAnd teaming up with Abrams, who energized the party during an unsuccessful bid for governor of Georgia, could show he has evolved on race and women and potentially inoculate himself from further criticism. It would be a salve, as New York\u2019s Jonathan Chait argued, for \u201cBiden\u2019s cringe-inducing and sometimes ghastly history of retrograde positions on segregation and criminal justice,\u201d would energize Democratic voters, and \u201cwould make Biden\u2019s race feel more serious.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut it\u2019s worth taking a moment to revisit that cringe-inducing and sometimes ghastly history. Biden, as Ryan Cooper wrote in The Week, was one of the Democrats who \u201cpushed the party away from Civil Rights.\u201d Biden embraced anti-integration measures early in his career in the Senate, becoming what Politico termed \u201ca leading anti-busing crusader\u201d in the 1970s. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Biden was one of the most vehement anti-crime crusaders in the Senate, pushing increasingly draconian punishments. Biden \u201cwasn\u2019t trying to compromise with the Republicans\u201d on crime, Ta-Nehisi Coates told New York magazine recently, but \u201cto get to the right of Republicans.\u201d\n\n\n\nBiden did so proudly. \u201cQuite frankly, the president\u2019s plan is not tough enough, bold enough, or imaginative enough to meet the crisis at hand,\u201d he said in 1989 about a crime bill being pushed by President George H. W. Bush. \u201cIn a nutshell, the president\u2019s plan does not include enough police officers to catch the violent thugs, enough prosecutors to convict them, enough judges to sentence them, or enough prison cells to put them away for a long time.\u201d In the Senate, Biden backed mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, civil forfeiture, and the death penalty. He bragged that one Democrat-backed crime bill in 1992 did \u201ceverything but hang people for jaywalking\u201d; two years later he would be a principal author of the 1994 crime bill that exacerbated mass incarceration.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tendency now to talk about Joe Biden as the sort of affable if inappropriate uncle, as loudmouth and silly,\u201d sociologist Naomi Murakawa told the Marshall Project in 2015. \u201cBut he\u2019s actually done really deeply disturbing, dangerous reforms that have made the criminal justice system more lethal and just bigger.\u201d Biden recently apologized for this stain on his record, saying \u201cI haven\u2019t always been right. I know we haven\u2019t always gotten things right, but I\u2019ve always tried.\u201d\n\n"

    "text": "With a few strokes on his keyboard on Thursday, President Trump undermined one of the fundamental norms of international law. \u201cAfter 52 years,\u201d he tweeted, \u201cit is time for the United States to fully recognize Israel\u2019s Sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which is of critical strategic and security importance to the State of Israel and Regional Stability!\u201d The timing of the tweet, 19 days ahead of Israel\u2019s elections, suggests that Trump is determined to assist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s reelection efforts, despite the prospect of increasing tensions with Arab leaders, Europe, and Russia, all of whom vehemently oppose recognizing Israel\u2019s Golan Heights claim. It will also embolden the Israeli far-right, which has been pushing for annexation of the West Bank.\n\nIsrael captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Six Day War. In 1981, the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, passed a law annexing the Golan, despite the clear prohibition in international law on forcible acquisition of land. In response, the UN Security Council passed resolution 497 determining that the Israeli law is \u201cnull and void.\u201d No country to date has recognized the annexation of the Golan and Israel itself conducted negotiations with the Syrian regime for the return of the entire territory in exchange for peace.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Syrian uprising in 2011 that devolved into a ferocious civil war, Israeli officials recognized the opportunity to win international legitimacy for the annexation of the Golan. As the Assad regime resorted to utilizing chemical weapons, barrel bombs and starvation sieges to crush the armed rebellion and protest movement, killing thousands of Syrians in the process, no international actor attempted to pressure Israel into negotiating with Assad. Israeli officials pushed the Obama administration to recognize Israel\u2019s annexation of the Golan, but came up short.\n\nTrump\u2019s presidency put multiple goals of Israel\u2019s right-wing government and even the Israeli far-right within grasp. In the first two years in office, the Trump administration withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal; cut U.S. funding to UNRWA, the UN agency in charge of providing relief to Palestinian refugees; softened its criticism of Israeli human rights abuses in the occupied Palestinian territories and at times even defended such abuses; and, most importantly, moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, implicitly recognizing Israel\u2019s annexation of east Jerusalem, which under previous deals negotiated between Israel and the Palestinians, is supposed to be the capital of a Palestinian state. Israeli officials began lobbying the Trump administration to recognize Israel\u2019s annexation of the Golan, but were previously unsuccessful, in part due to Russian pushback against recognition. (Russia has been providing military and diplomatic cover in support of the Assad regime)"

Of the 20 people, fourteen were on the panel being hosted by the New York City mayor about mental health. Just six people sat in the audience, not counting the few reporters who were there out of professional duty.\n\nDe Blasio is used to small crowds outside of his home city. Despite having visited Iowa four times since his election in 2014, he spoke to another paltry audience in Sioux City last month, this time telling around two dozen people that he thinks \u201cthis is a country waiting to be unified.\u201d By whom?

    "title": "The Growing Crisis of Guns on Campus",
    "authors": [
      "Matt Valentine"
    ],
    "text": "Other states did not immediately follow suit. But in 2007, the Virginia Tech massacre led to the formation of the group now called Students for Campus Carry, which quickly gained membership and attention nationwide. With support from SCC\u2014and, to a lesser extent, the NRA\u2014dozens of campus-carry bills were introduced in statehouses over the proceeding decade, many only passing after a second or third legislative session. Other states, such as Colorado and Oregon, adopted campus carry when universities lost court battles with gun rights advocates. Today, a complex patchwork of state laws makes it difficult even to say with clarity how many \u201ccampus carry\u201d states there are. (Eleven have permissive laws similar to Utah\u2019s; 16 ban guns completely; and 23 at least nominally allow guns on campus, but with more stringent restrictions and various caveats.)\n\nThe ostensible goal of campus carry was to empower armed civilians on college campuses to defend themselves and others from mortal danger. That has not yet happened. \u201cCampus carriers have not intervened in any incident anywhere in the country on a campus,\u201d said Stephen Boss, a professor of environmental dynamics and sustainability at the University of Arkansas.\n\nFor his new book, College Homicide: The Case Against Guns on Campus, Boss examined every campus homicide in the United States between 2001 and 2016. He found no direct interventions by campus carriers, and no deterrent effect. Murders are rare on campuses that allow concealed carry, but no rarer than on college campuses where guns are banned. \u201cUtah did pretty well for eight years,\u201d he said, \u201cand then a student shot himself [in the leg] at Weber State University in 2012, and then in 2016, \u201917, and \u201918, the last three years consecutively, there\u2019s been a murder with a gun on the campus of the University of Utah, Salt Lake. So their luck\u2019s run out.\u201d\n\n\n\nProfessors at the University of Texas at Austin are no longer allowed to post signs like this one. Jay Jenner/Austin American-Statesman via AP\n\nIn 2015, during the one-year window the Texas legislature allotted schools to prepare for campus carry, UT Austin hosted two public forums about the implementation. At one of these, I testified that the university should develop a protocol about what to do with guns left behind in bathroom stalls. (Should we bring them to lost and found? Call the police? Put an \u201cout of order\u201d sign on the door?) People laughed. A year later, students left guns in the women\u2019s bathrooms here twice in the same week. According to The Campaign to Keep Guns Off Campus, similar incidents have happened in Georgia and repeatedly in Kansas. And where there are guns, there will be accidents: An Idaho State professor shot himself in the foot during class, and an employee at the University of Colorado in Denver was trying to un-jam her gun when it went off, injuring herself and a coworker.\n\nIn addition to dealing with such accidents, campus-carry schools have spent millions adapting their physical infrastructure (installing gun safes, signage and metal detectors, for example), retraining staff, and replacing faculty members lost to attrition. Other instructors have changed their teaching practices by eliminating discussions of sensitive subjects that might raise tempers in the class, or by offering courses exclusively online, or even by holding office hours in bars or churches where guns are prohibited, rather than meet with armed students in their offices.\n\n\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the matter of campus suicide.\n\nThe late Allan Schwartz, a professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of Rochester, studied college suicide for the better part of two decades. In 2013, he published an article comparing suicide rates among college students with nonstudents. Using nationally representative data from 2007, he found that, among men age 18-24, the suicide rate was much lower\u2014about half\u2014for those enrolled in college. This, despite that fact that students and nonstudents attempt suicide at roughly the same rate (1.4 percent versus 1.8 percent).\n\nSchwartz considered various parameters that could account for the disparity, and became increasingly convinced that the single most consequential factor was access to guns. Students who lived on campus had a lower risk of suicide than those who lived off campus; those who were enrolled full time had a lower risk than those enrolled part time; those who stayed on campus continuously had a lower risk than those who went home for the weekends, and so on. The more time that students spent in an environment where guns were prohibited, the less likely they were to die by suicide.\n\nWhich wasn\u2019t surprising to mental health professionals. Decades of public health research have repeatedly demonstrated that access to guns increases the likelihood of a death by suicide. This is because over 80 percent of people who attempt suicide with a gun die as a result\u2014compared to less than 2 percent of those who use other common means, such as overdosing. And most people who attempt suicide and survive never make another attempt.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe more guns that are present, the higher the rates of suicide.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have no reason to think that the same sort of pattern wouldn\u2019t happen on college campuses that happens off college campuses\u2014the more guns that are present, the higher the rates of suicide,\u201d said Marjorie Sanfilippo, a psychologist at Eckerd College in Florida. To compare suicides at campus-carry schools and schools that prohibit guns, Sanfilippo has begun to survey the directors of college counseling centers across the country. So far, the results are stark: The campus-carry schools had significantly higher rates of both attempted and completed suicides. Sanfilippo acknowledges that her sample size thus far is very modest\u2014just 22 respondents. \u201cOf course, each one represents thousands of students,\u201d she said. She is planning to expand the scope of her research.\n\nLarge-scale research projects cost money, though, and when it comes to gun violence, the federal purse strings have been drawn tight for decades. Congress first threatened to defund the Centers for Disease Control in 1996 if it recommended any form of gun control. President Obama issued an executive order in 2013 instructing the CDC to identify priorities for gun violence research, and still the agency demurred. (Obama did get his report, but it was published by the National Research Council and was essentially an analysis of past research\u2014much of it decades old.) Language in last year\u2019s government spending bill softened the threat that gun research could imperil the agency\u2019s budget for injury prevention, but until funds are specifically allocated for gun research, the roadblock remains.\n\nAs long as the CDC avoids gun-related research, the institutions best equipped to study the issue are research universities, and they\u2019re about to receive a huge injection of funding for that express purpose. Over the next five years, the National Collaborative for Gun Violence Research plans to distribute up to $50 million from the RAND Corporation, specifically for academic research into gun violence. Sanfilippo is among the many researchers applying for support.\n\nMeanwhile, where campus carry has already been enacted, schools adapt. In 2016, UT Austin implemented a policy that allows faculty and staff members to prohibit guns in our offices. But we\u2019re only permitted to convey this rule verbally; we can\u2019t hang a sign saying, \u201cNo guns allowed.\u201d So my colleague George\u2014her nickname, as she resembles the Beatle\u2014came up with a work-around, which required the use of my 9mm Beretta semiautomatic pistol.\n\nInitially, I thought it would only be the two of us at target practice. But by the time I\u2019d secured permission to shoot on private property just outside town, three other women had asked to participate: a UT administrator, a graduate student visiting from another institution, and Ana Lopez, an undergraduate student who co-founded Students Against Campus Carry. She\u2019d become a public face of the resistance to campus carry, profiled in The New York Times and invited to the White House to meet with then\u2013Vice President Joe Biden. She\u2019d also been accused by gun rights advocates of not having the authority to debate campus carry because she didn\u2019t have experience shooting guns. She intended to negate that line of criticism by getting some range time.\n\nAs we bumped along a dusty road in the Texas Hill Country, the struts of my Volkswagen hatchback bucking under the weight of five passengers, four guns, and several boxes of ammunition, I was tempted more than once to call it off. Putting a gun in a student\u2019s hands seemed so obviously inappropriate that it needn\u2019t even be mentioned in the university\u2019s handbook of conduct. Or it used to seem that way, anyway.\n\nGeorge had brought her doctoral diploma, also from UT. With binder clips, we fixed it to a target in front of an earthen berm, along a creek lined with Texas live oaks. It hangs now in her office, where visitors ask about the bullet holes between the lines of calligraphy\u2014a prompt to discuss her office gun policy, in lieu of an overt sign.\n\nWhen Ana\u2019s turn came to shoot, I made her pause a moment as I checked again that the backdrop was clear. I glanced around to confirm everyone was wearing their ear plugs and safety goggles. \u201cOkay,\u201d I finally said. \u201cDisengage the safety.\u201d\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?"

    "text": "Less than three years after his unceremonious defenestration from the world of high finance, Marin had landed one of the city\u2019s highest-profile developments in the post-9/11 era. And with all the hands shaken and the dotted lines signed, the time had come for Marin to do what he did best: raise big money. It was a talent that had come to his rescue in the past, buoying him when his intricate deals went awry and his fortunes collapsed. And as fate of The Wheel unfolded\u2014through lawsuits and counter-lawsuits, ballooning costs, and a flood of cash from Chinese investors\u2014it became clear that it was a talent that would serve him well into the future. For people like Marin, hooked to a globalized network of easy money, there\u2019s always a lifeline.\n\n\n\nRich Marin was 22 when he arrived on Wall Street in 1975, brandishing an MBA from Cornell. It was fortuitous timing: Unbeknownst to him, that year was a turning point on the Street. When Marin showed up for his first day of work at Bankers Trust, the fusty financial sector had been newly emancipated by the deregulation regime of the Nixon administration. By the 1980s, vast fortunes were being made, often through opaque, labyrinthine financial arrangements, and a whole new ethos emerged, both vilified and admired, that was best summed up by the motto of Wall Street\u2019s archvillain Gordon Gekko: \u201cGreed is good.\u201d\n\nAt Bankers Trust, Marin rose rapidly, moving into commodities in 1981, where he bought and sold futures. Marin didn\u2019t invent derivatives\u2014a financial product that acts as a hedge against both losses and inflation\u2014but he was among the first to realize their insane money-making power. One day, Marin, then just 28 years old, bundled together about $10 million worth of futures contracts into an instrument that, on paper anyway, was technically low-risk. He wasn\u2019t even sure anyone would buy it, but, according to a 2012 profile in The Observer, \u201cwithin the hour, the sales guys had returned, wondering how many more of these deals he could put together. He quickly created a $100 million swap and sold that, too.\u201d\n\nRich Marin, a Wall Street veteran who goes by the nickname \u201cBig Rich,\u201d was the money man behind the New York Wheel. TODD HEISLER/The New York Time\u200bs\n\nMarin\u2019s creative thinking in these cutting-edge transactions would prove crucial to the bank\u2019s accelerating growth. This was still decades before Warren Buffett would deem derivatives \u201cfinancial weapons of mass destruction,\u201d but Marin was also one of the first to see their calamitous potential. In 1989, by then in charge of the entire Bankers Trust derivatives team, a dodgy deal detonated and nearly took Marin with it. His desk had issued over $100 million in futures contracts in cotton, from a merchant that had made some bad bets speculating on cotton futures. The merchant eventually filed for bankruptcy, but not before taking a chunk of Bankers Trust\u2019s fourth-quarter profits that year.\n\nMarin was prepared to resign over the deal, but the bank mercifully reassigned him to Toronto. After a series of good decisions running Bankers Trust\u2019s Canadian business, he was back in its good graces.\n\nThen, in, 2003, with more than 25 years at Bankers Trust under his belt, Marin relocated to the asset management team at Bear Stearns, which back then was \u201ca sleepy backwater,\u201d according to The New York Times. Marin, who had by then earned the nickname \u201cBig Rich,\u201d brought his outsize ambitions with him. He set the asset management group on a torrid growth campaign, pledging a \u201c10 in 10\u201d strategy\u2014by 2010, Marin promised to increase the division\u2019s share of Bear\u2019s total revenue from 1 percent to 10 percent.\n\nTurning again to the esoteric financial instruments that had been both the core to his success and the key to his almost-undoing, Marin shifted the group to a hedge fund model of high profit margins and premium fees. One fund, the High Grade Structured Credit Fund, invested in bonds and securities backed by subprime mortgages; to gain leverage, it borrowed against its underlying assets. The approach succeeded wildly, so much so that the group soon launched a sister fund in summer 2006 with even higher leverage, the High Grade Structured Enhanced Leverage Fund.\n\nMarin didn\u2019t invent derivatives, but he was among the first to realize their insane money-making power.\n\nThe Asset Management team was well on its way to hitting the seemingly impossible goal of tenfold growth\u2014if only Bear had lasted long enough to see the decade through. Just a year later, with the underlying mortgages faltering, the hedge funds began to collapse. Bear had to pony up $3.2 billion in secured loans to save the first fund, a mere glimpse of the massive bailouts that were to come. The second fund was deemed unsalvageable. Ten months later, there was no Bear Stearns. \u201cI was the owner of the first bungalow on the beach to get hit by the tsunami,\u201d Marin told me.\n\nIt\u2019s a telling reversal\u2014some would describe Marin as being the tsunami, not its first victim. Either way, helping destroy an 85-year-old investment bank didn\u2019t derail his career for long. In late 2008, Marin was picked up by Leviev\u2019s fund to unwind the very kinds of mortgage investments that he had previously stuffed, like nails and shards of glass, into the explosive devices that tore up the global financial system.\n\nAt the end of 2013, as Bloomberg was exiting office, plans for The Wheel had come into focus. It would be 635 feet tall, bigger than rival projects in Singapore and Las Vegas. It would have 36 glass pods that would fit 40 people each. A single loop on the wheel would last 38 minutes in total, complete with a light show to complement the views of lower Manhattan. All told, The Wheel would hold 1,440 paying customers per revolution, each shelling out $35 for a ticket, and run from 10 am until midnight.\n\nAnd the customers, the organizers claimed, were already en route. Some four million tourists were riding the free Staten Island ferry to get a glimpse of the overbooked and overcrowded Statue of Liberty, which the ferry passes by. As it was, those people weren\u2019t even leaving the ferry terminal\u2014with photos of Lady Liberty banked on their phones, they headed straight back to Manhattan. But with a larger-than-life attraction to keep them on the island, they\u2019d be lining up for an experience that would rival the bright lights of Times Square.\n\nMeanwhile, Marin and his team had signed up a contractor: Mammoet Starneth, the Dutch firm that had handled the London Eye. With everything falling neatly into place, New Years Eve 2015 was circled as a tentative opening date.\n\nMarin proved his worth from the get-go. In an early hiccup, the project\u2019s seed funding, a paltry $5 million, which Laufer had assured both Kaufman and Marin he had secured, fell through. But Marin scored an audience with some of New York City\u2019s most endowed real estate developers: Jeffrey Feil of the Feil Organization, Lloyd Goldman of BLDG, and, eventually, Joseph Nakash of Jordache Enterprises\u2014all billionaires with major New York portfolios. Marin caught Feil and Goldman on a good day, flush with cash after flipping a major property on Fifth Avenue. After a 45-minute pitch, they forked over the seed funding, and then some.\n\nEven with deep-pocketed billionaires on board, however, The Wheel would still need a lot more dough. Ceding hundreds of millions in equity wasn\u2019t a compelling option, nor was a loan for a project of this scale, which would result in pricey interest rate payments.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the originator of a lot of ideas, but I am a guy who gets things done,\u201d Marin told me. Sure enough, it was Eric Kaufman who, in a master stroke, suggested EB-5 foreign investor financing as a solution. But once the possibility had been floated, it was Marin who made the financing a reality.\n\nEB-5 is an immigrant investor visa program, first enshrined as a provision in a 1990 immigration bill signed into law by George H.W. Bush. It afforded foreign investors the chance to effectively purchase a U.S. residency on the back of a low-interest loan to an American business. The loans had to be $1 million in general, but only $500,000 if that business was located in a region whose unemployment rate was 150 percent of the national rate, so long as that loan created 10 jobs per investor. The EB-5 investors would see their loans paid back over time. For their trouble, they, as well as their spouses and any children aged 21 or under, would receive a green card.\n\nThe program landed with a thud. In 1992, citing low interest, Congress added \u201cregional centers\u201d\u2014business entities designated by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) to administer EB-5 investments\u2014to prop up interest in the program.\n\nBut even with the regional centers in place, EB-5 didn\u2019t prove to be a major draw for foreign investors, and what interest it did attract was checkered. The program\u2019s early years were marred by shady foreign actors and widespread malfeasance. Investigations turned up numerous instances of tax and wire fraud throughout the 1990s, with firms providing falsified documents to cover for investors who didn\u2019t even have the requisite funds to furnish the loans. At one point the program was shuttered entirely. The scandals continued despite numerous attempts to bring it above board in the 2000s. Well into that decade, only a fraction of the allotted 10,000 annual visas were being awarded.\n\nAn artist\u2019s rendering of the New York Wheel, serviced by the Staten Island Ferry. Bill Murphy\n\nBut in 2009, with the world\u2019s investment markets under major duress, the program underwent an overhaul\u2014not aimed at cleaning up its act, but relaxing its standards. In the wake of the same financial crisis that had washed out Bear Stearns, the basic solvency of the country\u2019s major banks was in doubt and it had become nearly impossible to borrow money for large construction and development projects. So that year, USCIS launched a series of changes to the program. Construction jobs hadn\u2019t previously counted toward the 10 jobs per investor threshold; now they would be. The number of jobs would no longer be counted by the number of W-2s issued, but rather by the amount of money spent, according to Gary Friedland, a scholar in residence at NYU Stern School of Business who has testified before Congress on the program. Even the money spent by workers on an EB-5 project\u2014on lunch, transport, and the like\u2014would count toward overall job creation. And the restrictions on what constituted a \u201chigh unemployment area\u201d were relaxed so much that nearly any district could be stretched to qualify.\n\nThe global financial community finally took notice. \u201cEB-5 became extremely common after the financial crisis,\u201d Friedland told me, \u201cand very broad.\u201d With the rules revised and unemployment spiking anyway, virtually every project in the country could be proven as benefiting a high unemployment area, effectively lowering the individual investment amount to $500,000 across the board. The fact that jobs were being counted by money spent and not jobs created incentivized massive cost overruns. And even though EB-5 investment would only constitute a small percentage of the money spent on a particular project\u2014frequently between 10-30 percent\u2014all the jobs created by that project would count toward the visas.\n\nForeign nationals, mostly of the newly-minted Chinese upper class, began to realize the potential of a pay-for-passport program.\n\nThe reward for developers was obvious. EB-5 loans would come with an interest rate that was a fraction of what might be obtained from a bank or a hedge fund. While EB-5 funding remained eligible for any American business, it quickly became exclusively the remit of real estate. Nearly 900 regional centers cropped up to help facilitate such financing.\n\nDevelopers reveled in the fountain of cheap capital, while foreign nationals, mostly of the newly-minted Chinese upper class, began to realize the potential of a pay-for-passport program that came at a steep discount compared to peer programs in Canada and elsewhere. In recent years, EB-5 has exploded as a premiere funding source of major real estate projects. Jared Kushner gained infamy by attempting to raise $150 million via the program to help bankroll a Jersey City skyscraper in 2017 (facing scrutiny, he dropped that fundraising effort in 2018). In New York City alone, the Four Seasons Tribeca, 111 West 57th St, and much of Billionaires Row have been funded in part by EB-5. The development of Manhattan\u2019s Hudson Yards\u2014the largest private real estate project in U.S. history\u2014has significant EB-5 money, as much as $1.5 billion according to Friedland. There is now a backlog of eager applicants; the 10,000-person yearly quota has basically maxed out each of the past five years, a screaming increase from as recently as 2010, when barely 1,900 EB-5 visas were submitted for and granted.\n\nAs 2013 turned to 2014, The Wheel promised to churn through capital. Marin secured a letter from a hedge fund called Highbridge Capital Management promising a $200 million construction loan. But the loan had a hefty interest rate of 10.25 percent.\n\nWith some $80 million in investment from equity partners, that $200 million would have covered the estimate Marin and his team had given to the city. But as Marin signed up the contractor and looked hard at the estimates, it became clear that $250 million wasn\u2019t going to cut it. \u201cIt was a very preliminary guess,\u201d Marin told me. More money was going to be needed, and paying upwards of 10 percent on an additional loan was a backbreaking proposition.\n\nKaufman, who first raised the idea of EB-5 financing, wanted a generous finders fee for his stroke of genius. \u201cThat was the only cost-effective money in the deal,\u201d Kaufman told me. But in early 2014, EB-5 still carried an air of illegitimacy. Established real estate people found it unreliable. \u201cThey thought it was tainted stuff that you only used when you couldn\u2019t get regular funding,\u201d Marin said.\n\nMarin\u2019s thinking changed when he heard from Tom Rosenfeld, founder of CanAm Enterprises, a regional center that carried a \u201cstrong reputation,\u201d according to Friedland, the NYU professor. Rosenfeld had furnished a $76 million loan to help finance a new car rental facility at the Hawaiian airport, and put up $122 million to help complete the Philadelphia convention center. He was looking for a foothold in New York City, and Marin had to admit that the idea was attractive. If EB-5 was meant to fund projects that otherwise wouldn\u2019t be built, Marin told me, \u201cwe were perfect.\u201d\n\nEventually, the investors saw it as he did. So in March of 2014, Marin journeyed to where the appetite for investor green cards was greatest: China.\n\nOver the course of 12 days, Marin and Rosenfeld went on a breakneck tour from city to city\u2014Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Shanghai. \u201cI\u2019ve done lots of road shows in my day,\u201d said Marin, but in China, \u201cthey do it big.\u201d Marin and his entourage traveled from one luxury hotel to the next. In Wuhan, they were announced with a rock star entrance, Marin said, with some 40 attendants lining the entry to the grand ballroom where they pitched The Wheel. Gilded, overstuffed chairs awaited them on stage; the audience was composed of Chinese entrepreneurs, husbands and wives, as well as children. There were so many kids\u2014who, remember, are also eligible for the EB-5 visa investment of their parents\u2014that the event\u2019s organizers set up a daycare center at the ballroom\u2019s entrance. An artist\u2019s rendition of The Wheel was projected on the screen, while the audience paid rapt attention to Marin\u2019s every word. \u201cYou do that five times over,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a show.\u201d\n\nIndeed, five presentations later, they had secured 300 investors, good for $150 million in additional funding, at a paltry 2.7 percent interest rate, to be paid back by 2021. By July of that year, six months after Marin had applied for EB-5 approval, The Wheel had secured its foreign investment money. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not because I\u2019m a handsome guy,\u201d Marin told the Staten Island Advance at the time. \u201cIt probably has to do with the fact that this is a sound project\u2014it hits all the right buttons.\u201d\n\nBut no amount of money, it seemed, was enough. With that round of fundraising complete, the project\u2019s price tag had risen to over $500 million. And it just kept rising, thanks to a confluence of factors that were both endemic to New York City construction projects and unique to The Wheel.\n\nFirst, there was a wave of cost overruns. The site was run by two separate contractors: Mammoet Starneth, the Dutch firm, and the construction company Gilbane. Through 2015 and into 2016, estimates from both groups continued to escalate. Yet-to-be assembled pieces languished in high-priced storage facilities in Brooklyn and six foreign countries. Problems onsite forced reevaluations. The project had to be refinanced, with the cost nudging up to $610 million. The original investors threw in more cash, while Marin wrung even more out of Highbridge and CanAm, which now had 412 investors on board to the tune of $206 million.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done lots of road shows in my day,\u201d said Marin, but in China, \u201cthey do it big.\u201d\n\nThen there was the parking garage. As part of Staten Island agreeing to the deal, Marin had to furnish a 950-spot parking garage, replete with immersive pre-ride attractions, including a photo booth, a green roof for picnics, and possible outdoor concert venue. In addition to entertaining Wheel riders while they waited in line, the garage had to accommodate shoppers at the neighboring Empire Outlets mall. Marin wasn\u2019t thrilled about the garage to begin with\u2014he had wanted tourists to access The Wheel by ferry, not by car. But he grew incensed when the garage began eating away a good chunk of the project\u2019s overall cost.\n\nBy early 2016, the cost overruns had sowed serious agita amongst the investors, and the squabbling quickly turned litigious. After refusing to pony up more money, Eric Kaufman and Meir Laufer were pushed out. In an email to investors, Kaufman said the cost overruns came \u201cwithout explanation\u201d; Laufer claimed he was being run out because of his Orthodox Jewish faith. Wheel Estate LLC, the legal entity of the majority investors in the project, sued both Kaufman and Laufer for refusing to dilute their shares. Laufer and Kaufman countersued, naming Marin in February 2016 filings. Suddenly, a lot of money was being spent on lawyers.\n\nAnd the ballooning costs were only compounded by the physical challenges of literally getting The Wheel off the ground. The project was so big and ambitious, Marin said, that it was pushing \u201cthe limits of physics and metallurgy.\u201d By June 2016, The Wheel\u2019s foundation was complete, while the legs were being assembled off-site. In the summer, a concrete pour was completed for the Wheel\u2019s base and the adjacent parking garage. In May of 2017, however, a vicious pay dispute caused Mammoet, which had again increased its estimate for cost of completion, to walk off the job. That begat further legal action and court filings that revealed a litany of alleged problems: shoddy welds on the legs; \u201cwrong\u201d attachments between The Wheel and its base. Mammoet claimed that even the base itself was unsound, and that the site had \u201cinsufficient soil support.\u201d\n\nMammoet\u2019s departure necessitated a search for another contractor, which ate up even more money and forced the project into an indefinite delay.\n\nAt the end of July, the Staten Island Advance wrote that $400 million of the reported $580 million in funding had already been spent\u2014a whopping $250 million had gone into the parking garage alone; $80 million to recently terminated contractor Mammoet; $30 million to keep the site running.\n\nAt this point, The Wheel would need some three million visitors a year, according to an estimate by Hunden Strategic Partners, just to break even. \u201cEven if The Wheel were built, what was the exit strategy to pay off the investors?\u201d asked Friedland, the NYU professor. \u201cCan the cost of a ride really sufficiently cover the debt service?\u201d\n\nThe Staten Island Advance also reported that some $300 million more would be needed to complete the project. In September, the city rejected a last-ditch request by the developers that tax-free bonds be issued to make up the difference in funding. Since the project was privately funded, it was hard to know how much money The Wheel had or needed. There were rumors that the Highbridge loan had fallen through. \u201cSo far, what we\u2019ve seen in this case, unfortunately, is a project that is not going to be economically viable,\u201d said Mayor Bill de Blasio. By fall 2018, the cost of completion had reportedly ballooned to over $1 billion.\n\nWith the project on indefinite delay and looking increasingly unlikely, the investors turned on Marin. In January 2018, he was terminated. Nine months later, the project was pronounced dead.\n\nAny great moonshot requires a little wishful thinking. \u201cI\u2019m one of probably two people on earth that still think this thing is gonna be built,\u201d Marin said in January. That sentiment was shared by Debi Rose, Staten Island\u2019s councilwoman: \u201cI have not given up hope, I\u2019m still seeking out other contractor developers that might want to take on this project so that this space can be a destination and be the draw that we had hoped the New York Wheel would be.\u201d\n\nBut on January 16, at the Delaware law offices of Richards, Layton & Finger, the New York Wheel was scrapped for parts in a bankruptcy auction. Its offerings: legs for $9.2 million; frame braces for $3.4 million; rim parts for $13 million; capsules for $23 million. The majority of the parts will be melted for scrap.\n\nIn the end, Staten Island came away with a parking garage. \u201cThe developers of The New York Wheel are proud to have delivered a state-of-the art, modern 325,000 square-foot garage structure,\u201d spokeswoman Cristyne Nicholas said. Others aren\u2019t so pleased. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that we\u2019re stuck with the ugliest part: a parking garage that blocks the view from Richmond Terrace,\u201d David Goldfarb, a former president of the St. George Civic Association, told The New York Times.\n\nThere\u2019s also the concrete base, in which was buried a time capsule, filled with, among other things, a New York Wheel\u2013shaped USB drive containing a video of how The Wheel was built; a jar of honey; and a $10,000 gift certificate from Empire Outlets. Instructions were issued for the capsule to remain concealed until 2646\u2014630 years in the future, one for every foot of the wheel\u2019s height.\n\nNot everyone sees the project as a total loss. A statement provided to me by CanAm confirmed that all necessary standards had been met \u201cfor the unconditional permanent residency for all of our 412 investors in the project. In fact, many of these approved investors have already received their conditional green cards and are U.S. residents.\u201d\n\nAnd Rich Marin quickly caught a new gig\u2014consulting for the Eye of Texas, a 541-foot observation wheel planned in Dallas."

      "Andre Pagliarini"
    ],
    "text": "Back in Brazil, there are some concerns that Bolsonaro is confusing fleeting ideological affinities with strategic geopolitical realignment. He was widely pilloried in the Brazilian press, for example, for visiting CIA headquarters, a step no Brazilian president has ever taken\u2014for good reason, considering the CIA\u2019s role in Latin America since the 1950s. And Bolsonaro seemed blithely unconcerned by the fact that political winds in the United States might shift next year. During a joint press conference on Tuesday, Bolsonaro was asked how he would react if a self-avowed socialist were to beat Trump in the 2020 presidential election. \u201cWell, it\u2019s an internal matter. We will respect whatever the ballots tell us in 2020, but I do fully believe Donald Trump is going to be reelected.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro is betting the rest of his presidency on a continued partnership with Trump.\n\nWhile Trump has begun to ratchet up his rhetorical attacks on socialism in response to its rising appeal among younger voters and within the Democratic party, Bolsonaro has been railing against it for years, proclaiming that the mild center-leftism of the Workers\u2019 Party that governed Brazil for thirteen years was leading the country to an authoritarian abyss. \u201cEvery day,\u201d he declared at the White House on Tuesday, \u201cmore and more people that are prone to socialism, and even communism, slowly are going to be opening their minds to the reality. And you can see the border with Venezuela and Brazil was recently closed\u2014not for Brazilians, which are pro-socialism, to go into Venezuela, but the other way around, so that Venezuelans who support democracy wouldn\u2019t go into Brazil. This feeling most certainly is going to be very much seen when 2020 comes.\u201d Through Bolsonaro\u2019s fanciful assessments of the political landscape in Brazil, which he argues is largely controlled by nefarious \u201ccultural Marxists\u201d despite the fact that he handily won a national election on a campaign defined by homophobia, belligerence, and racism, a strategy begins to emerge: Bolsonaro is betting the rest of his presidency on a continued partnership with Trump.\n\nThis gamble is due primarily to the paranoid conspiratorial worldview both men share. They mostly agree on the problems facing the world and how to solve them. But Bolsonaro may also have little choice but to cling to his U.S. analogue: He has become so internationally reviled so quickly that finding willing partners going forward may prove difficult. Since October of last year, Democrats have urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to denounce Bolsonaro\u2019s most egregious statements. In a major foreign policy speech at Johns Hopkins University, Bernie Sanders included Bolsonaro in a global far-right wave of \u201cdemagogues who exploit people\u2019s fears, prejudices and grievances to gain and hold on to power.\u201d Sanders has also established close ties with Fernando Haddad, the Workers\u2019 Party candidate Bolsonaro defeated in the 2018 elections. Bolsonaro, in other words, will likely not find a friendly ear should the Democrats win the presidency. While becoming a pariah would obviously not be in Brazil\u2019s best interest, Bolsonaro\u2014along with his foreign minister, as I have argued elsewhere\u2014has shown little willingness to soften his rhetorical edges for foreign audiences.\n\nThis is why, rather than adopt a diplomatic approach to the current occupant of the White House, seeing him as a temporary partner, Bolsonaro instead treats Trump as a life jacket. As long as he has an ally in Washington as reactionary and aggressively ignorant as Trump, Bolsonaro will have the latitude to pretend his administration has influence at the highest echelons of global power. If, instead, the tide is turning on Trumpism and the 2020 election results reflect that, Bolsonaro may very well be held accountable abroad for his hyperviolent rhetoric.\n\nSome of Bolsonaro\u2019s critics, particularly those on the left, argue that it doesn\u2019t matter who the U.S. president is\u2014Brazil will always be placed in a junior position and taken advantage of by the world\u2019s hegemonic power. It is true that the United States has never treated Brazil with the respect Brazilians feel they deserve as a large democracy with a diverse population, an appealing and vibrant national culture, and abundant natural resources. But wholeheartedly embracing an American president as erratic as Trump is more risky for Brazil than a balanced posture would be, one that would give Brazilian policymakers room to maneuver should the political situation in Brazil and the world begin to change."

    "text": "For decades, the Republican economic creed has revolved around low taxes and free markets. The sacred dual directives had to be vigorously defended and market regulations of any kind aggressively parried. Free-market prophets such as Milton Friedman suggested a society\u2019s \u201cbelief in freedom itself\u201d might be measured by its commitment to deregulation. But quietly, in the past few months, there have been signs of a shift away from the faith, triggered by a most unlikely model for conservatives: communist China.\n\nIn February, the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, chaired by prominent Republican Marco Rubio, released a report on \u201cMade in China 2025,\u201d Beijing\u2019s mercantilist plan to dominate high-tech industries in the coming years. The report credited the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s (CCP) interventionist policies for China\u2019s meteoric economic development and technological advances. As angry libertarians quickly noted, it was a striking betrayal of free-market orthodoxy, concluding that the United States must adopt some measure of state planning in order to keep pace with China, which is fast catching up in artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and biotech, among other emerging technologies.\n\nPiggybacking on that apparent free-market blasphemy, Intel in early March released a white paper calling for a comprehensive national strategy to bolster U.S. AI capabilities. Through increased regulation and the liberation of vast reserves of government data, it argued, the United States would be able to stave off China\u2019s rising technological threat and foster innovation. The paper also highlighted the threat posed by Beijing\u2019s growing lead in government-directed AI startup funding.\n\nSomething about China\u2019s technological prowess has spooked America\u2019s traditional free market apostles, both in the public and private sectors. Communal faith in unfettered capitalism is hitting a wall as Beijing announces itself\u2014through increased military spending, South China Sea initiatives, and more\u2014as the United States\u2019 chief geopolitical rival. While our much ballyhooed economic system has led to wage stagnation and widespread deindustrialization, a growing group of China-admirers point out, China\u2019s state-planned economy has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty over the past forty years, and Beijing now plays host to more billionaires than New York. Although this view ignores China\u2019s current economic slowdown, massive debt burden, and among other economic imbalances competing experts point to as sources of a potential crash, such caveats have not done much to dim the new enthusiasm for the Chinese model."

It was 1977, and he was 35. The images collected here offer a portal into a lost political world: a faraway, enchanted realm in which Mitch McConnell sought elected office as a moderate man of the people. If it were possible to travel back in time and preserve this Mitch McConnell in amber and reanimate him intact, as the original imagineers of Jurassic Park did, today\u2019s Republican Party might have become something quite dramatically different than the cynical manufactory of obstruction and scorched earth that it\u2019s morphed into on the watch of the real-world McConnell."

    "text": "Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler is not your average climate denier. Unlike President Donald Trump, he\u2019s admitted that global warming is real and caused by humans. And unlike many Republicans in the House and Senate, he\u2019s admitted that its effects will be dangerous if warming continues unabated.\n\nBut when it comes to admitting that swift, aggressive action is necessary to slow the dangers of climate change, Wheeler is just like most Republicans: He denies it. In an interview with \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d on Wednesday, the former coal industry lobbyist said that global warming is simply too vague and distant a threat to focus on.\n\n\u201cOn the climate change issue, it is an important issue that we have to be addressing and we are addressing it,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cBut most of the threats from climate change are 50 to 75 years out.\u201d Instead of climate change, Wheeler argued that the EPA\u2019s efforts would be better spent focusing on cleaning up water in other countries. \u201cWe have 1,000 children die every day worldwide because they don\u2019t have safe drinking water,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a crisis I think we can solve.\u201d\n\nIf humans didn\u2019t intend to keep living 50 to 75 years from now, Wheeler\u2019s argument might be a good one. But we do, making his argument exceedingly bad\u2014as Twitter was kind enough to point out.\n\n"

    ],
    "text": "\u201cAmerican nationalism isn\u2019t the same as in other countries,\u201d McCain argued in his 2018 book The Restless Wave (co-written with Mark Salter). \u201cIt isn\u2019t nativist or imperial or xenophobic, or it shouldn\u2019t be. Those attachments belong with other tired dogmas ... consigned to the ash heap of history. We live in a land made from ideals, not blood and soil.\u201d He also wrote, \u201cThe great majority of unauthorized immigrants came here to find work and raise their families, like most immigrants have throughout our history. They are not the rapists, killers, and drug dealers of fevered imaginations on the Right. They\u2019re not the cause of the opioid epidemic.\u201d (As so often, though, McCain\u2019s noble words were belied his actions. In 2010, he ran for re-election under the slogan \u201ccomplete the danged fence,\u201d an anticipation of Trump\u2019s \u201cbuild the wall.\u201d)\n\nIn foreign policy, American Greatness saw the United States as the confident, assertive leader of the West, willing and able to challenge foes. At its worst, it promoted military adventurism. In his better moments, McCain\u2019s foreign policy had a larger sense of purpose than just military assertiveness, and included an awareness that America had a role to play in upholding the international order with diplomacy. In other words, McCain balanced nationalist belligerence with a sense of international responsibilities. This made McCain more mindful of cultivating alliances than other Republicans, and eager to protect America\u2019s good reputation by foreswearing torture.\n\nMAGA, by contrast, is a bitter, backward-looking nationalism. It has little use for immigrants, except as political foils (see Trump\u2019s exploitation of the murder of Mollie Tibbetts), and is fueled by racial resentment. In foreign policy, MAGA sees the U.S. not as the pillar of the international order, but a sucker being exploited by allies. For Trump, good foreign policy is to get more out of other countries than they take, whether through plunder (\u201ctake the oil\u201d) or shakedowns (starting trade wars, threatening NATO allies). And of course, Trump has openly extolled torture.\n\nYet if American Greatness and MAGA are two different paths of conservative nationalism can take, they do share a connection. By picking Sarah Palin to be his running mate in 2008, John McCain helped pave the way for MAGA and Trump. McCain wanted to energized the GOP base but he got more than he bargained for. Palin went rogue with atavistic resentment, most famously in her attacks on Obama for \u201cpalling around with terrorists.\u201d It was a short distance between that and birtherism, which Palin also embraced. Trump was all but inevitable.\n\nMcCain was clearly uncomfortable with this turn. He saw little of Palin after 2008, and earlier this year expressed regret that he didn\u2019t pick Joe Lieberman as his running mate instead. McCain also reportedly wants Obama to deliver a eulogy at his funeral\u2014and has asked that Trump not attend."

    "title": "Making #MeToo Work in Pakistan",
    "authors": [
      "Farah Amjad"
    ],
    "text": "\u201cWhen we talk about #MeToo in Pakistan,\u201d said Mariam Durrani, a Pakistani-American anthropologist and feminist scholar at Hamilton College in New York, \u201cwe are still really exclusive in terms of the voices that are being included, there\u2019s a huge majority of Pakistanis who are not included.\u201d\n\nThe way this class-based feminism plays out has at times been discouraging. For example, it was the personal testimonies of women like Frieha Altaf, a socialite and CEO of a public relations company, that propelled #MeToo from the margins of the Pakistani digital sphere to its mainstream. Following the rape and murder of a seven-year-old girl named Zainab Ansari in January 2018, Altaf tweeted that she was sexually abused by her family\u2019s cook when she was six years old. Later, Atlaf launched her own spin-off of #MeToo, called #MainBhi (the Urdu translation of #MeToo), at that year\u2019s Lux Style Awards, Pakistan\u2019s largest entertainment and fashion awards ceremony. However, #MainBhi merely called on people to speak out about social injustice in general\u2014the #MeToo message diluted, perhaps, by the effort\u2019s corporate origins.\n\nAnother telling example involves pop star Ali Zafar, who has maintained his professional and celebrity standing despite being accused of harassment by prominent musician Meesha Shafi and many other women. Zafar\u2019s film Teefa in Trouble, released just months after the allegations came out in April 2018, was a box office hit. Zafar\u2019s co-star in Teefa in Trouble, a young actress who often talks about the need for more diverse and substantial roles for women in television, even defended Zafar, citing his family values as proof of his innocence. While young feminists in Lahore and Karachi protested outside of film theaters, elite feminists were largely silent. \u201cWhen faced with an actual #MainBhi moment, the vast majority of Pakistan\u2019s feminists, the most notable of whom tend to be among the country\u2019s elites, are choosing inaction, ambivalence, or silence,\u201d said the writer Rafia Zakaria.\n\nThat ambivalence is felt in politics, too. Shireen Mazari, Pakistan\u2019s minister for human rights, dismissed Gulalia\u2019s allegations against Imran Khan in 2017, even though her own daughter left Khan\u2019s party in 2012 due to the harassment she experienced there. Mazari resigned from the party that year in protest. Mazari ended up rejoining PTI, and in 2016 she was subject to the kind of gendered harassment and abuse that is all too common for female politicians in Pakistan. During a raucous parliament session, a federal minister called Mazari a \u201ctractor trolley,\u201d ridiculing her voice and appearance.\n\nThat Mazari dismissed Gulalia\u2019s claims despite her own personal experiences with harassment is as instructive as it is disheartening. \u201cOne of the defining characteristics of elite circles in Pakistan is that whenever an allegation of any sort, not even just sexual harassment, comes up against one of their own, they will definitely rally to his or her support, no matter how progressive they proclaim to be,\u201d said Hafsa Khawaja, a writer and recent graduate of the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS). \u201cI think that has been a major issue when it comes to #MeToo in Pakistan.\u201d\n\nStill, despite #MeToo\u2019s limits, the emergence of new online feminist movements has coincided with and encouraged a shake-up of how people advocate for women\u2019s rights in Pakistan. \u201c#MeToo merely served as a catalyst for what was already brewing here,\u201d said Alia Amirali, a leftist-feminist political worker and member of the Women\u2019s Democratic Front.\n\nAlthough the movement for women\u2019s rights and equality in Pakistan began in the early days of the country\u2019s creation in 1947, it has recently been dominated by an NGO-funded model of women\u2019s empowerment that became popular in the country in the 1990s. This model has contributed to ideological differences in Pakistani feminist thought, specifically between the two dominant forms, secular and Islamic. Scholars argue that secular feminists\u2019 \u201clack of clarity\u201d on the question of religion has allowed Islamic feminists and others to perpetuate the idea that secular feminists are importing Western ideas that conflict with Pakistan\u2019s Islamic and cultural values. And because many secular feminists come from elite and middle-class backgrounds, feminism is thus also seen as a project of the urban, liberal elites.\n\nMen in power often perpetuate and exploit such ideas to belittle feminist organizing and activism. After this year\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day on March 8, when thousands of women marched in rallies across Pakistan, popular television host and politician Aamir Liaquat Husain urged Imran Khan to open an investigation into the marches. \u201cWhere did they get the money from. ... Who was behind it?\u201d asked Husain in a video posted on Twitter. Other men were offended by the posters at the march, including one that read, \u201cKeep your dick pics to yourself.\u201d\n\nThe split among feminist activists is unfortunate, given that Pakistani women of all backgrounds are sympathetic to feminist ideas. Fauzia Husain, a PhD candidate in sociology at the University of Virginia, saw this in her fieldwork with lady health workers, many of whom come from working-class backgrounds. Husain told me that these women used \u201cthe most feminist language\u201d of those she surveyed, despite having little to no familiarity with feminist discourse. To the question of \u201cWhy women are treated like animals,\u201d one of the workers responded, \u201cWe\u2019re treated like this because of the men.\u201d\n\nThe feminist landscape in Pakistan has grown and changed in the past decade. Social media has empowered new feminist voices, organizations, and modes of organizing, while independent feminist organizations have emerged to challenge the dominance of NGO-funded groups. The Women\u2019s Democratic Front (WDF) was created in 2018 by feminists from the political left, and includes members of the Awami Worker\u2019s Party, which is based in Lahore. WDF has been using social media to promote its work in working-class and rural communities. In doing so, the organization has magnified the voices of women who have traditionally been neglected by feminist groups.\n\nMeanwhile, a growing Pakistani feminist presence on social media, particularly Twitter, has facilitated dialogue between feminists from different professional and ideological backgrounds. \u201cThe Essential Pakistani Women on Twitter\u201d list features a diverse set of Pakistani women, many of whom self-identity as feminists, including journalists, academics, activists, and engineers. These women, in turn, are actively contributing to global conversations about feminism, which are then translated back to address Pakistani concerns.\n\nThere are plenty of disagreements among the new feminist groups. #MeToo\u2019s focus on sexual harassment, for example, is a point of contention for WDF, which is more concerned with the systemic way in which patriarchy oppresses women in Pakistan. Some feminists are also wary of #MeToo\u2019s name-and-shame approach toward individual bad actors, which likewise may come at the expense of a grassroots, structural approach.\n\nBut those differences have not hampered dialogue and collaboration between the groups. Last summer, members of Girls at Dhabas and Women\u2019s Action Forum, one of the oldest independent Pakistani feminist groups, helped create a first-of-its-kind sexual harassment policy for educational institutions in Pakistan. The policy came in response to an ongoing sexual harassment problem at Cedar College, a private high school in Karachi. Because Pakistan has no laws on sexual harassment of students in educational institutions, schools often do not have means to protect students or address issues when they arise. The new policy provides an ample definition of sexual harassment and lays out policies and procedures that schools can use to investigate allegations. Cedar College signed on to the policy and is implementing it. The policy is now being circulated to other schools and universities across the country.\n\nOne of the co-writers of the policy was Hiba Thobani, a lawyer who worked on a sexual harassment case that provided a lot of momentum for #MeToo. Thobani spent three years helping a Karachi University assistant professor fight a sexual harassment case against a senior visiting faculty member, who also happens to be a prominent literary figure in the country. Through working on the case, Thobani saw how the processes laid out by the 2010 workplace harassment law were complicated by institutional inefficiencies and disregard for the pain and difficulties that the victims have to endure. The assistant professor\u2019s claims were investigated at least three times, there were instances of evidence tampering, and at one point, the ombudsperson overseeing the case was replaced on corruption charges. By the time that the final verdict came in favor of the victim in early 2018, Thobani had lost confidence in the process. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us saw it coming,\u201d she said. \u201cWe thought we would have to appeal to the high court, but we didn\u2019t need to because we got the verdict in our favor.\u201d\n\nThe case not only made the assistant professor an \u201cicon\u201d of #MeToo, but also sparked a larger examination of existing laws and policies on sexual harassment. Lawyers wrote op-eds in leading newspapers about the shortcomings of existing sexual harassment laws. The country\u2019s Supreme Court recently asked federal and provincial governments to simplify and strengthen existing laws and procedures concerning sexual harassment, specifically the 2010 workplace harassment law. This came as the result of efforts by the AGHS Legal Aid Cell, co-founded by the late-human rights lawyer and women\u2019s rights champion Asma Jahangir.\n\nOther feminists are spearheading efforts to make legal services more accessible to sexual harassment victims. The Digital Rights Foundation, run by a leading feminist voice Nighat Dad, recently launched a legal support platform for victims of sexual harassment. The platform, which enables victims to connect with pro-bono lawyers and counselors, was created in response to the legal retaliation that met complaints of harassment from working women and students.\n\nWhile efforts to reform existing sexual harassment laws have long been in the making, #MeToo has accelerated them. It has not only made feminists more aware of the legal challenges sexual harassment victims face, but also given them an opportunity to affect how those challenges are addressed. In this sense, #MeToo has at least given the problem a new shape. Fiza Khatri, who spearheaded Girls at Dhabas\u2019 work with Cedar College, admits that there is still so much more that #MeToo has to accomplish in Pakistan. \u201cWe haven\u2019t experienced #MeToo in full throttle. We\u2019ve experienced it in a burst. We know what works and what doesn\u2019t. We know what the challenges are.\u201d\n\nImran Khan\u2019s public rebuke of feminism has made the work of these feminists all the more urgent. \u201cIt\u2019s a really exciting time for sure,\u201d said Sadia Khatri of Girls at Dhabas. \u201cThe contradictions are real, but they are not to be feared I think. They\u2019re just part and parcel of living here, a country where patriarchy runs so, so deep.\u201d"

    "text": "It\u2019s rare for The New York Post to understate a story in a headline, but late Sunday, the tabloid posted a piece titled \u201cDe Blasio speaks to crowd of only 20 people in New Hampshire.\u201d The reality was even bleaker. Of the 20 people, fourteen were on the panel being hosted by the New York City mayor about mental health. Just six people sat in the audience, not counting the few reporters who were there out of professional duty.\n\nDe Blasio is used to small crowds outside of his home city. Despite having visited Iowa four times since his election in 2014, he spoke to another paltry audience in Sioux City last month, this time telling around two dozen people that he thinks \u201cthis is a country waiting to be unified.\u201d By whom? De Blasio didn\u2019t say. But if a politician visits a primary state and talks about the need for unity, they almost certainly think they\u2019re the one who can bring Americans together.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been clear I\u2019m certainly not ruling out a run for the presidency,\u201d he said in Iowa last month. \u201cI\u2019ve also said that as a progressive, as someone who believes that we need to change this country\u2014we need to change the Democratic Party\u2014I am going to go all around this country talking about the changes I think we need.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt increasingly seems that no one is listening. Even ostensible allies are urging de Blasio to concentrate on his day job. One former aide told Politico that for de Blasio to even consider a 2020 bid is \u201cfucking insane.\u201d After all, being the mayor of over eight million people is difficult enough. \u201cN.Y.C. is at an inflection point,\u201d one former ally said, \u201cand the chief executive should focus on his responsibility to guide the city through what are likely to be difficult times.\u201d De Blasio\u2019s own wife has said it\u2019s \u201cnot the right time\u201d for a presidential campaign.\n\n"

    "text": "Brexit so far has been a story of the United Kingdom\u2019s political class losing its authority. Last week\u2019s three-day voting spree in the House of Commons was the culmination of a two-year effort by the U.K.\u2019s government and Parliament to extract the country from the European Union, to \u201ctake back control,\u201d as the Leave campaign slogan promised. Yet those votes\u2014rejecting the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal Tuesday, rejecting both the option of a no-deal Brexit and the option of a second referendum on Wednesday, and voting to delay exit Thursday\u2014demonstrated that neither the ruling party nor any other parliamentary faction commands the majority to do that in practice. In fact, the only tangible outcome of the last week has been, ironically, to shift control of Brexit\u2019s fate to the EU.\n\nOne of the reasons the U.K. finds itself in this situation is that it was not clear from the start who should have gained control as a result of Brexit. Theresa May\u2019s government assumed the task of implementing the referendum\u2019s result lay with the executive. Their plan was to trigger Article 50 of the EU Treaty\u2014the legal process by which an EU member state initiates the withdrawal \u00adprocess\u2014without consulting the legislative branch, Parliament. That seemed to make a mockery of the very value over which the U.K.\u2019s departure from the EU was fought in the first place: parliamentary sovereignty. The challenge to May\u2019s plans didn\u2019t come from the Commons, but from a civilian, Gina Miller, who took the government to court and won. As a result, Parliament had to debate and vote on whether it approved the initiation of the U.K.\u2019s exit from the EU. The bill passed comfortably in February 2017 but set a precedent: The government couldn\u2019t simply do as it pleased when it came to Brexit terms\u2014it had to get Parliamentary approval. May had to promise Parliament a \u201cmeaningful vote,\u201d i.e. a vote on the government\u2019s final withdrawal agreement with the EU. It is this meaningful vote that May has been trying, and failing, to win since she struck her deal with the EU back in November.\n\nLast Tuesday, May\u2019s withdrawal deal was defeated in Parliament by 149 votes, only two weeks ahead of the U.K.\u2019s scheduled March 29 departure date. It was a better result than January\u2019s, (when a near identical deal was rejected by the greatest margin in modern parliamentary history) but still nowhere near a majority. It appears as though the Prime Minister has lost control of Brexit, her government\u2019s main preoccupation, and that Parliament has taken over. But things are never that simple when it comes to Brexit. Parliament is divided in different factions, aiming for different outcomes, yet without the power to bring any of those outcomes about.\n\nA group of ultra-Euroskeptic Conservative MPs, the European Research Group (ERG), are opposed to May\u2019s deal because of the so-called backstop, a provision that avoids the creation of a hard border between Northern Ireland (part of the U.K.) and the Republic of Ireland (part of the EU) as a result of Brexit. The absence of such a border is integral to the Good Friday Agreement which ended decades of violence between the two countries, but hardcore Brexiteers don\u2019t like the idea of keeping Northern Ireland (and, by extension, the U.K.) in a European customs union to fulfill that requirement. Instead, the ERG favors a so-called \u201cno-deal Brexit\u201d wherein the U.K. leaves the European Union without any arrangements in place. The option is predicted to lead to severe economic disruption, but prominent Brexit campaigner Boris Johnson has called it the only way that the country\u2019s self-respect can be preserved. The DUP, a Northern Irish party propping up May\u2019s minority government, has also taken this position. No-deal is still legally the default if the U.K. can\u2019t come up with a deal before the deadline, so the ERG and DUP are hoping that by blocking May\u2019s deal, no-deal becomes more likely. The majority of Parliament, however, finds a no-deal Brexit unacceptable, and last Wednesday voted to rule it out as an outcome."

    "text": "Toronto gave Kenner his first great mentor: Marshall McLuhan, then an obscure professor incubating the media studies that would make him famous in the 1960s. McLuhan and Kenner shared a worldview that combined conservative politics with an enthusiasm for experimental literature. They saw the great modernist works as a balm for the alienation of modernity\u2014like a sip of brandy that could cure a hangover. This perspective had a religious component: McLuhan was a Catholic convert, and Kenner a self-described Catholic fellow traveler who would join the Church in 1964. Their turn toward Catholicism occurred as the Church, on the cusp of Vatican II, was gingerly making peace with modernity.\n\nHugh Kenner, photographed by Ralph Eugene Meatyard. The Photography Collection, Harry Ransom Center/The University of Texas at Austin, and the Estate of Ralph Eugene Meatyard/Fraenkel Gallery, San Francisco\n\nIt was in McLuhan\u2019s company in 1948 that Kenner met Ezra Pound, then incarcerated for alleged insanity in St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C. Pound, who had been the great impresario of modernism, writing its manifestos and closely nurturing the work of T.S. Eliot and many other writers, was then at the low point of his reputation, widely derided as a lunatic, a traitor, an anti-Semite, and a fascist. There was truth to most of these accusations: Pound had spent the war years making a series of deranged radio broadcasts, denouncing Jews, democracy, and the United States while also praising Mussolini\u2019s regime. But Kenner, who had a lifelong contrarian tendency to try and find the nugget of wisdom in cranks, fell under the spell of Pound\u2019s poetry and quickly became his leading advocate.\n\nUnlike Davenport, Kenner was never too shy to publish. When he and Davenport first met at a Columbia University panel discussion in 1953, Kenner already had two books under his belt (on G.K. Chesterton and Pound) and two more (on Wyndham Lewis and James Joyce) on the way. By 1958, the year in which Questioning Minds begins, Kenner, although only four years Davenport\u2019s senior, was much more firmly established in the literary world. Davenport was still a graduate student while Kenner was ensconced as head of the English Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and an important, if controversial, voice in literary criticism.\n\nCritics, especially liberal and leftist ones, treated the early Kenner with wariness. His intelligence was undeniable, but the anti-liberal undercurrent of his work rankled. Writing in Partisan Review in 1954, Irving Howe sneered, \u201cWhen a charlatan like Wyndham Lewis is revived and praised for his wisdom, it is done, predictably, by a Hugh Kenner in The Hudson Review.\u201d Stung by this hostility, Kenner cast about for allies. He found one in the form of William F. Buckley, whom he met at a party in 1957. Buckley and Kenner became tight friends, with Kenner emerging as a frequent contributor to Buckley\u2019s National Review.\n\nAs a conservative modernist, Kenner occupied a precarious position: Liberals distrusted him for his conservatism, conservatives for his modernism. During his tenure as National Review\u2019s poetry editor, Kenner had to fend off readers upset by the vers libre and left-wing politics of William Carlos Williams. \u201cNational Review has some of the dumbest readers in the world,\u201d Kenner lamented. The magazine, Kenner noted, had a \u201cstodgy tendency to equate conservatism with resistance-to-all-change-of-preconceptions.\u201d On the flip side, Denise Levertov withdrew a poem from National Review when she discovered the magazine\u2019s politics.\n\nIn his search for allies, Kenner set his sights on Davenport. His early letters work toward the twin goals of recruiting Davenport to join him at the University of California and to write for National Review. Davenport never took the job\u2014he settled for the University of Kentucky, nearer his South Carolina family\u2014but he did become one of the most prolific National Review essayists, even though he did not share the magazine\u2019s politics. (Davenport always voted Democratic, until Bill Clinton drove him into the arms of Ralph Nader in 1996; in his fiction, he took imaginative pleasure in exploring the ideas of the utopian socialist Charles Fourier.)\n\nDavenport the public writer was born in these essays. As National Review\u2019s jack-of-all-trades, he tackled everything from Tarzan to Tchelitchew, from Toulouse-Lautrec to Tolkien. This National Review writing formed the seedbed for The Geography of the Imagination (1981), the much-cherished Davenport collection that was a National Book Awards finalist in 1982. With characteristic slyness, Davenport enjoyed sneaking in praise of same-sex love and androgyny to the pages of William F. Buckley\u2019s magazine. (Though National Review wasn\u2019t always the most congenial home for Davenport\u2019s thoughts: In 1970, he wrote a review tracing back Hemingway\u2019s prose to Walter Pater\u2019s aestheticism. This was an idea Kenner would return to in his own work. But a National Review staffer scoffed and added a note at the beginning of the issue complaining, \u201cHe\u2019s comparing Hemingway to that purple faggot Walter Pater!\u201d)\n\nThe real drama of the Davenport-Kenner correspondence is to see two prickly, isolated minds start to flower in the warmth of mutual understanding. Time and again, Kenner can be seen prodding Davenport to turn his private passions into public art. Charmed by Davenport\u2019s Max Beerbohm\u2013style cartoons of writers, Kenner recruits him to illustrate two of his critical books, The Stoic Comedians (1962) and The Counterfeiters (1968). Impressed by ad hoc translations Davenport supplied in the letters, Kenner eggs him on to publish his quirky, sharp-worded translations of Archilochus and Sappho. \u201cCurious as it may sound, you are the first person who has ever encouraged me in my work,\u201d Davenport wrote Kenner in 1962.\n\nDavenport, for his part, turned Kenner into a much more daring writer. Kenner\u2019s pre-Davenport books are assertive but still operate under the conventions of normal scholarship. Having Davenport as a sympathetic reader, Kenner let loose his ambition to write books about modernism that mimic modernist literary techniques: They are nonlinear, boldly jumping from topic to topic, juxtaposing disparate scenes with the expectation that the reader will fill in the gaps. Kenner modeled The Counterfeiters and The Pound Era on Pound\u2019s Cantos, a fragmented epic that combines lyrical observation and radical juxtapositions with historical sweep. The Counterfeiters is a juggling act of a book that, under the umbrella of mechanical reproduction, links together Gulliver\u2019s Travels, the early computer designs of Charles Babbage, the impact of empiricism on bad poetry, Jorge Luis Borges, the evolution of Latin abstract nouns, Buster Keaton, Andy Warhol, and Alan Turing\u2019s speculations on artificial intelligence (among many other topics). The sum is the funniest book of literary criticism ever written.\n\nOne of the revelations of Questioning Minds is that Kenner freely mined Davenport\u2019s correspondence for ideas and phrases. The first chapter of The Pound Era presents a defense of Pound\u2019s translation of Sappho. Reading the letters, you can see how Kenner\u2019s book reworks Davenport\u2019s ad hoc explanation of the translation to Kenner. Davenport\u2019s lessons on working with torn papyrus lead to a key insight of The Pound Era, that the modernists used fragments the way archaeologists do, not as ruins to be mourned but as rich sources of knowledge.\n\nIn 1963, Davenport visited Ezra Pound\u2019s childhood town, Wyncote, Pennsylvania, and gathered stories about the last visit the poet ever made there. Davenport wrote this up in a beautiful letter, which, distilled, became the last paragraph of The Pound Era. None of this amounts to plagiarism. Not only did these borrowings have Davenport\u2019s approval, but the two men had also by then formed a mind-meld that made it impossible to separate out their thoughts. Asked by Davenport if he could write on topics Kenner had touched, Kenner responded, \u201cThere is no property in the things of the mind.\u201d Earlier, Kenner\u2019s friendship with McLuhan foundered when the media sage unjustly accused his disciple of stealing his ideas. In fact, Kenner had written up ideas developed together in conversation, with a lucidity McLuhan was incapable of. With Davenport, Kenner found a more congenial collaborator.\n\nOne of the enthusiasms Kenner and Davenport shared in the 1960s was for the architect and futurist Buckminster Fuller, who popularized the idea of synergy and coined the term \u201csynergetics.\u201d The word has now unfortunately passed into management consultant cant, but the friendship of Kenner and Davenport illustrates a truly remarkable kind of relationship. Writing to Davenport in 1963, Kenner tried out an idea, \u201cI am coming to think that the key to the Pound Era is the discovery of synergy.\u201d Modernism, by this account, was a vortex, a joining together of talent that created something greater than the sum of its parts. Hence Kenner\u2019s fascination with the synergistic event or happy collaboration: Pound\u2019s extensive editing of The Waste Land, Pound\u2019s use of Ernest Fenollosa\u2019s notes to reinvigorate the translation of Chinese poetry, even something as lowly as Pound buying the impecunious Joyce a new pair of shoes.\n\nWhile Davenport is chatty and revealing from the earliest letters, the tone of Kenner\u2019s correspondence goes through an important change as he grapples with the cancer of his first wife, Mary-Jo Kenner, in 1963 and 1964. Prior to that crisis, Kenner tended to be aloof and professional. During those years, Kenner was on a leave to teach at the University of Virginia, which allowed Davenport to make visits, and he became a source of comfort for the family. In his letters, Kenner opens up as never before, writing about such intimate matters as his decision, shared by his dying wife, to convert to Catholicism. After Mary-Jo Kenner died in December 1964, Davenport helped Kenner look after his five children during the funeral. John Kenner, who was ten at the time, told me, \u201cGuy Davenport once spent a weekend drawing with me, distracting me from my grief over my mother\u2019s death.\u201d\n\nAfter Davenport returned home from the funeral, Kenner wrote, \u201cHow wonderful to have you around: especially as your dealings and doings with the children have helped me to realize what an achievement that family is: and it is her achievement. They are, singly and collectively, her memorial. Everything perhaps perishes but tradition.\u201d With these words, Kenner is articulating the central theme of The Pound Era: the power of a living and creative tradition as a stave against loss. The Pound Era would be dedicated to the memory of Mary-Jo Kenner. Kenner remarried the following year, with Davenport as part of the groom\u2019s party and William F. Buckley as best man.\n\nTaking to heart Ezra Pound\u2019s injunction to \u201cmake it new,\u201d Kenner and Davenport wrote letters alive with fresh language. Here is Davenport\u2019s account of riding with a student on the back seat of a motorcycle on the way to New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art (with a nod to Davenport\u2019s military service):\n\nWith knees kissing, now this, now that entire flank of a taxi, we threaded fifty blocks of traffic. Only in mountain climbing or in firing 8\u201d Howitzers with a cold breech does one feel as helpless: life means nothing and everything. But I had a captive audience to lecture to, explaining the whole damn museum in three hours.\n\nHere he is describing Buckminster Fuller, briefly comparing him to a student named Robert Gallway (given the epithet Erewhonian, from Samuel Butler\u2019s novel Erewhon):\n\nHe\u2019s a dwarf, with a worker\u2019s hands, all callouses and squared fingers. He carries an ear trumpet, of green plastic, with world series 1965 printed on it. His smile is golden and frequent; the man\u2019s temperament is angelic, and his energy is just a touch more than that of the Erewhonian Gallway (champeen runner, footballeur, and swimmer). One leg is shorter than the other, and the prescription shoe worn to correct the imbalance comes from a country doctor deep in the wilderness of Maine.\n\nAnd here is Kenner trying to comprehend the cancer that would soon kill his first wife: \u201cWe are all dying, but at different rates.\u201d Questioning Minds is chock-full of countless sentences of like quality: chewy, savory, nutritious.\n\nSome of the more pernicious sides of Pound, however, also left a mark. In his letters, Pound liked to refer to languages with ethnic slurs (referring to Italian, for instance, as \u201cwop\u201d). Both Kenner and Davenport echo their master in this juvenile habit, a failure of the humanism that is the hallmark of their best work. It also mirrors one of the few significant failures of The Pound Era, the lack of full reckoning with Pound\u2019s anti- Semitism. Ezra Pound was a cyclops: a giant cursed with tunnel vision and easily blinded. Kenner and Davenport, frequently brilliant and at times blinkered, also belonged to the tribe of one-eyed geniuses.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know what Kenner, as a traditionalist Catholic, made of Davenport\u2019s bisexuality. In The Stoic Comedians, Kenner made a strange offhand jibe about \u201csodomy.\u201d In National Review, Kenner aligned himself with the socially conservative wing of the magazine, praising Joseph Sobran\u2019s book of essays against abortion, feminism, and gay rights. Davenport was formed in the pre-Stonewall world and wasn\u2019t public about his sexuality. But he didn\u2019t quite hide it either. It was more of an open secret. When he took up writing stories again in 1969, his work was unabashedly homoerotic, often dealing with the sexual awakening of queer boys. In his letters to Kenner, Davenport doesn\u2019t identify his boyfriends as such but certainly speaks of them with the same openhearted warmth that he uses for his girlfriends. And Davenport also wrote to Kenner about the love life of his gay friends, such as the poets Jonathan Williams and Ronald Johnson.\n\nEzra Pound was a cyclops: a giant cursed with tunnel vision and easily blinded. Kenner and Davenport also belonged to the tribe of one-eyed geniuses.\n\nKenner and Davenport never stopped being friends, but starting around 1975 their relationship cools. Letters become less frequent and more perfunctory. \u201cWe, you and I, are beginning to drift out of synchronicity,\u201d Davenport wrote Kenner in 1977. In his introduction to Questioning Minds, Burns speculates that \u201cperhaps as Davenport\u2019s homoerotic interests emerged in his fictions and in his drawings Kenner withdrew from contact with him.\u201d Arguing against this is Kenner\u2019s continued praise of Davenport\u2019s fiction; in 1996, Kenner wrote a rave review of Davenport\u2019s last story collection, The Cardiff Team, (even commending one homoerotic story for its \u201csexiness\u201d) as well as an affectionate introduction to Guy Davenport: A Descriptive Bibliography, 1947\u20131995.\n\nKenner\u2019s personal coolness and silence could perhaps have resulted from the fact that he and Davenport had just gone on separate career paths, with Davenport increasingly focused on creative work that precluded scholarly collaboration. Or it could have been a matter of aging. William F. Buckley also felt that in his last few years Kenner was becoming more distant. Whatever the cause of the diminished friendship, Davenport was left baffled and hurt. \u201cFrom Hugh I\u2019ve heard nothing,\u201d Davenport complained to the publisher James Laughlin in 1990. \u201cWe used to be the best of friends.\u201d\n\nIn 2002, Kenner wrote his last letter to Davenport. It reads in part: \u201cWe\u2019ve been separated for too long; here I am in the final months of my 79th year.\u201d Hugh Kenner died the following year; 14 months later, so did Guy Davenport. The penultimate sentence of The Pound Era is a quote from The Cantos: \u201cShall two know the same in their knowing?\u201d It\u2019s followed by a sentence first written by Guy Davenport in a 1963 letter, which Kenner got permission to appropriate: \u201cThought is a labyrinth.\u201d"

    "text": "Nunes\u2019s claim for damages also doesn\u2019t hold up. He says that Twitter bears legal responsibility for any defamatory posts made on its platform. In reality, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act generally shields websites from civil liability related to third-party content on their platforms. Nunes himself should be pretty familiar with this: As Reason\u2019s Elizabeth Nolan Brown pointed out, he and his colleagues have been working to change Section 230 for this exact reason.\n\nNunes adopts a patriotic mien when it comes to the broader free speech issues at stake. \u201cAccess to Twitter is essential for meaningful participation in modern-day American Democracy,\u201d he told the court. \u201cA candidate without Twitter is a losing candidate. The ability to use Twitter is a vital part of modern citizenship. A presence on Twitter is essential for an individual to run for office or engage in any level of political organizing in modern America. This is because Twitter is not merely a website: it is the modern town square.\u201d\n\nThis paean to civic speech might be more convincing if Nunes didn\u2019t ask the court to force Twitter to \u201creveal the names and contact information\u201d behind four of the pseudonymous accounts. What\u2019s more, he also wants the court to \u201cpermanently enjoin and order Twitter\u201d to suspend Mair and the other accounts. Twitter is a vital part of modern American citizenship, Nunes says, and he wants the government to strip people of access to it for being mean to him.\n\nBut Americans have every right to mock and insult their elected officials. During the election of 1796, the first contested presidential race in the nation\u2019s history, Alexander Hamilton wrote a pseudonymous pamphlet that accused Thomas Jefferson of having an affair with an enslaved woman he owned. (The allegation later turned out to be true.) Jefferson\u2019s supporters jeered at John Adams as \u201cHis Rotundity\u201d and called him a hermaphrodite, while Adams\u2019s camp accused Jefferson of supporting prostitution and incest. Adams later arrested one of Jefferson\u2019s pamphleteers during the election of 1800 and tried to prosecute him under the Alien and Sedition Acts. The American tradition of salacious and spurious political attacks is alive and well in the Trump era.\n\n\n\nThe New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, a Supreme Court case from 1964, set a formidable threshold for defamation claims by public figures like Nunes. The justices cited a \u201cprofound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open,\u201d even if it includes \u201cvehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\u201d The tweets against Nunes appear to fall well within those bounds. But Nunes ignores that landmark ruling (perhaps because, like Justice Clarence Thomas, he would like to see Sullivan overturned). Instead, he cites a smattering of other cases to defend his \u201cfundamental constitutional interest and entitlement to the uninterrupted enjoyment of his reputation.\u201d One of his longest citations isn\u2019t from law, but a passage from Shakespeare\u2019s Othello in which Iago bemoans that \u201che that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him, And makes me poor indeed.\u201d\n\nSo why embark on what appears to be a doomed legal endeavor? Perhaps Nunes genuinely believes he\u2019s the victim of a conspiracy theory by Democrats and America\u2019s foreign adversaries. If there\u2019s evidence to support this, Nunes doesn\u2019t offer it. \u201cThe full scope of the conspiracy, including the names of all participants and the level of involvement of donors and members of the Democratic Party, is unknown at this time and will be the subject of discovery in this action,\u201d he noted in the complaint. In other words, Nunes wants to go on a fishing expedition to satiate his political grievances, and he wants the courts to light the way.\n\nOr maybe Nunes is trying to use the legal system to get revenge on his political opponents. Defending oneself against litigation is onerous even for those with the financial means to fight back. (Mair urged her Twitter followers on Monday night to donate to her legal defense fund.) The rich have always wielded the American legal system as a cudgel against critics, as Peter Thiel did in financing the Hulk Hogan lawsuit that ultimately killed Gawker. That a member of Congress would attempt to do so is deeply disturbing.\n\nNunes\u2019s largely anonymous Twitter critics cast him as a shameless partisan hack\u2014someone who abuses power and the legal process to injure his political opponents, who plays fast and loose with the truth to advance partisan goals, and who\u2019s prone to conspiratorial thinking on the flimsiest of grounds. They say he lacks the temperament and honor to serve on the House Intelligence Committee and safeguard the nation\u2019s secrets. His lawsuit only proves them right."

    "text": "But besides the document\u2019s winks at the slang-riddled discussions of far-right message boards, the manifesto is far from ironic. In fact, for much of its eighty-odd pages, it is a deadly serious screed, promulgating some of white power\u2019s grounding myths and showcasing its most violent consequences. What it reveals is a familiar enemy that, for entirely pragmatic and propagandistic reasons, has dressed itself up in memetic ephemera.\n\nMuch of the manifesto\u2014which begins with the line, \u201cIt\u2019s the birthrates,\u201d repeated three times\u2014is fixated on reproduction, a classic preoccupation of white supremacist ideology. The author writes about his fear and rage at the thought of \u201cinvaders\u201d\u2014anyone nonwhite, but particularly Muslims\u2014outbreeding \u201cEuropeans.\u201d He claims, baselessly, that Muslims have preternaturally high birth-rates, and that the disparity between white and nonwhite births will lead to the crisis named in the manifesto\u2019s title: the \u201cGreat Replacement,\u201d an ethnic, cultural, and racial erasure. The theory was promulgated by the French racist ideologue Renaud Camus in a 2012 book of the same name; since then, it has spread through an international network of white supremacists.\n\nFrom its very first page, the manifesto proclaims its ideology in screaming capital letters: \u201cTHIS IS WHITE GENOCIDE.\u201d The text crawls with references to historical events and personages glorified by white supremacists, from the Crusades to the Roman emperor Elagabalus. The killer claimed to have been radicalized by the 2017 death of the young Swedish girl Ebba \u00c5kerlund, whose murder by an Uzbek migrant was covered extensively in the far-right press. And the text is sandwiched between images of the Sonnenrad, or Black Sun, which the Anti-Defamation League describes as \u201cone of a number of ancient European symbols appropriated by the Nazis in their attempt to invent an idealized \u2018Aryan/Norse\u2019 heritage.\u201d\n\nThroughout the text, it\u2019s clear that the cultural touchstones Tarrant finds most evocative aren\u2019t the fleeting, satire-laced symbols that typify the alt-right, such as Pepe, a cartoon frog adopted by neo-fascists as a satirical mascot. Instead, Tarrant exalts the pure-white past white supremacists have conjured up for Europe, and evokes the maudlin myths of nationalist agitprop. Europe, in his estimation, was once filled with noble white men fighting swarthy interlopers, from Medieval battles against Saracens to the 1683 Turkish siege of Vienna.* The manifesto incorporates poems by Rudyard Kipling and Dylan Thomas. At points, its syntax soars into a kind of faux-Romantic prose: \u201cAccept death,\u201d he advises his audience, \u201cit is as certain as the setting of the sun at evenfall.\u201d\n\nTarrant was also deeply immersed in the coarser rhetoric of the anonymous message boards 4chan and 8chan, and other online havens of white-supremacist sentiment. In the 8chan post that contained links to both the manifesto and a Facebook livestream of the killings, he wrote: \u201cWell lads, it\u2019s time to stop shitposting and make a real-life effort post.\u201d (\u201cShitposting,\u201d in internet-culture slang, is essentially making a ruckus online for the sake of making a ruckus, flooding message boards or social media with low-quality content.) The image he used to accompany his post was a long-circulating 4chan meme depicting an overly online Australian. And his war cry, before opening fire on worshipers, was a reference to a mega-popular YouTuber who goes by PewDiePie."

    "title": "What Was the Foodie?",
    "authors": [
      "Josephine Livingstone"
    ],
    "text": "When you take into account the way the fine dining industry overlaps with home cooking and food media, the overall effect is of a culture that skews male, white, and wealthy. Foodie-ism, in this country, is largely created by white people for white people. As Korsha Wilson noted in a widely shared Eater piece on dining while black, fancy restaurants are often hospitable only to the white and affluent: \u201cAs many black diners know, being in a dining space can often mean choosing between being ignored, interrogated, or assaulted.\u201d\n\nEven attempts to diversify foodie culture contain a pernicious brand of exoticism. The writer and artist Sukjong Hong (who is also a former staffer at The New Republic) put it to me this way: She loves food and cooks often for her family, but sees foodie-ism as \u201ca form of conspicuous consumption that disguises itself as cultural acumen.\u201d When food is separated out from its practical function and cultural context and turned into a media property, foodie-ism is often \u201corientalist and neocolonial in its language of \u2018discovery,\u2019\u201d Hong said, particularly in its \u201cvaluing of authenticity around foods that are not from the dominant culture.\u201d It is how miso and soy sauce, everyday staples in Asian cuisine, become the province of experts.\n\nI recently tagged along with a food critic to a restaurant she was planning to review (she asked to remain anonymous for professional reasons). Between bites of a sandwich that I would struggle to describe to you (I am allergic to the dominant tropes of food writing: the \u201cthrumming bass line\u201d of spice in a dish, endless and labored synonyms for \u201ccrispy,\u201d etc; the sandwich was good) I put my questions about the problem with foodie-ism to her. My acquaintance is a white woman, and she noted that there are lots of people who look like her at the top of food publications. White women are socialized to cook at home, but also made to feel (more) welcome in a prestige office environment.\n\n\n\nA fancy restaurant critic, on the other hand, gets his expertise through sheer volume of experience, trekking across the fine dining institutions of the world. That takes money, unless you have a reliable expense account. It might also take a certain skin color: She cited Wilson\u2019s piece about her experience at the Grill in Manhattan, where a bartender assumed she\u2019d never tried a negroni before and condescendingly explained to her the principle of bitter flavor profiles.\n\nOn the face of it, we were discussing the kinds of bias that shape every American industry. Race, class, and gender inflect everybody\u2019s experience of life, in and out of the workplace. But only the most coddled of our society get to build a career in restaurant criticism, which remains the ultimate arbiter of what sophisticated eaters value in their food. Meanwhile, line cooks in fancy restaurants and diner chains continue to make roughly the same wages.\n\nAll our discussions about food are shot through with these fundamental inequities. Take a recent GQ profile of Tunde Wey, written by Brett Martin. Wey makes delicious food, but his work is also a form of political performance art: in Martin\u2019s words, \u201ca hybrid of political action ... revolutionary rhetoric, impish provocation, and other assorted acts of public intellectualism, all built around a critique of the way we eat in America today.\u201d Wey melds cookery with a potent critique of gentrification and racial inequality. For example, in 2018 he hosted an event called Hot Chicken Shit in Nashville, where he charged white diners $1,000 for four pieces of chicken, or a Nashville property deed for a whole chicken. Black diners ate for free.\n\nMartin, however, openly has trouble with Wey\u2019s approach and worldview. He describes the \u201cpain and frustration\u201d he felt when Wey took him to task for fawning over a white southern chef. On another occasion, Martin accuses Wey of \u201chating food,\u201d positing that his \u201cindignation at foodie culture was, at least in part, a puffed-up justification for what was really a deep ambivalence about pleasure.\u201d This is an old chestnut in conversations around food: the idea that physical pleasure is a neutral, apolitical sensation. Wey responded that he loved to eat and that of course \u201cthere should be places where dining is simple pleasure, where food is respite and solace.\u201d But the problem is that everywhere is like that: \u201cif all your spaces are spaces where you eat and don\u2019t think about shit, then you\u2019re never thinking about shit!\u201d\n\nIt is curious that the commercialization of foodie-ism surged in the wake of the financial crash of 2008. Instead of leading to a more frugal eating culture, precarity has resulted in a proliferation of the luxury restaurants that have come to symbolize our Gilded Age. Look no further than the new Hudson Yards complex in New York, which will feature 25 separate places to eat over the course of a few city blocks, including new ventures from superstar chefs like Thomas Keller and David Chang.\n\nStill, the recession did have an impact. \u201cThe financial crash changed everything in the restaurant space,\u201d Amiel Stanek, an editor at Bon Appetit, told me. The recession, he said, \u201csaw the end of a certain kind of fine dining: finance-bro, expense-account kind of restaurant. We saw the rise of fine casual, with places like gastropubs, and a new focus on certain kinds of cuisine that were not \u2018Frenchy\u2019 or Japanese. You saw a lot of regional Italian food, which felt homey and safe to people, and a lot of British food, interestingly.\u201d\n\nThe vibe in America post-crash, Stanek said, was \u201cone of nervousness around ostentatious displays of wealth. Restaurants started capitalizing on shows of austerity.\u201d This helps explain the rise in nose-to-tail and farm-to-table eating. Diners were spending the same amount as in the old white-tablecloth spots, but the sensibility had changed. In the meat world, for example, \u201coff-cuts became really popular,\u201d Stanek noted. \u201cYou suddenly saw hanger steak on every menu, you saw short rib on every menu, you saw pork belly on every menu.\u201d When filet mignon and rib-eye started to feel distastefully extravagant, hanger steak took off. And now it\u2019s expensive, because consumers want to identify with it.\n\nNose-to-tail and farm-to-table became key market principles in recession food culture, part of a \u201cfantasy of rustic or peasant-style cooking,\u201d in Stanek\u2019s words. As Americans rejected excess they embraced a new ethos of authenticity. \u201cWhether a place was really making authentic Sicilian food, or authentic Roman food, or was being true to some kind of farm-to-table ethos, the appearance of a vision became more important,\u201d Stanek said.\n\nMuch of millennial consumer culture is about our instinctive sense of precarity, our allergy to corporate signifiers, and our formless urge to be good people who won\u2019t screw up the world all over again. But the food market adapted, of course, and continued to take our money, though selling us different values. Transparency, authenticity, good health, convenience, anti-snobbery\u2014all now available at Sweetgreen!\n\nThis is all a lot to hold in one\u2019s head every time one orders a meal. As The New Yorker\u2019s food writer Helen Rosner told me, we make decisions about food several times a day. So, no matter how much we know about how we should eat, our knowledge about food always exists in tension with learned habits in our daily behavior. Philosophers call this gap between knowing and doing the \u201cmalaise of will,\u201d Rosner explained. Food is so close to the grain of our lives that we eat on unconscious instinct, which is often just another word for bias.\n\n\n\nWithout a doubt, food has become newly political. The difficulty of defining that politics, however, lies in the fact that food culture is precisely coextensive with human culture. Food is virtually synonymous with life. We all need to eat, and when we stop to consider our eating habits we are really pondering a galaxy of concerns that seem all out of proportion with, say, the desire to eat a croissant. When a behavior happens constantly, it can be almost impossible to gain the Archimedean point necessary to see it clearly.\n\nBut just as Betty Friedan took ordinary life as her subject in The Feminine Mystique, to show that the \u201cnormal\u201d is political, the many ways that social politics inheres in food culture prove that point all over again. What has felt like a special interest subject is, in fact, everybody\u2019s business."

    "text": "Nunes\u2019s claim for damages also doesn\u2019t hold up. He says that Twitter bears legal responsibility for any defamatory posts made on its platform. In reality, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act generally shields websites from civil liability related to third-party content on their platforms. Nunes himself should be pretty familiar with this: As Reason\u2019s Elizabeth Nolan Brown pointed out, he and his colleagues have been working to change Section 230 for this exact reason.\n\nNunes adopts a patriotic mien when it comes to the broader free speech issues at stake. \u201cAccess to Twitter is essential for meaningful participation in modern-day American Democracy,\u201d he told the court. \u201cA candidate without Twitter is a losing candidate. The ability to use Twitter is a vital part of modern citizenship. A presence on Twitter is essential for an individual to run for office or engage in any level of political organizing in modern America. This is because Twitter is not merely a website: it is the modern town square.\u201d\n\nThis paean to civic speech might be more convincing if Nunes didn\u2019t ask the court to force Twitter to \u201creveal the names and contact information\u201d behind four of the pseudonymous accounts. What\u2019s more, he also wants the court to \u201cpermanently enjoin and order Twitter\u201d to suspend Mair and the other accounts. Twitter is a vital part of modern American citizenship, Nunes says, and he wants the government to strip people of access to it for being mean to him.\n\nBut Americans have every right to mock and insult their elected officials. During the election of 1796, the first contested presidential race in the nation\u2019s history, Alexander Hamilton wrote a pseudonymous pamphlet that accused Thomas Jefferson of having an affair with an enslaved woman he owned. (The allegation later turned out to be true.) Jefferson\u2019s supporters jeered at John Adams as \u201cHis Rotundity\u201d and called him a hermaphrodite, while Adams\u2019s camp accused Jefferson of supporting prostitution and incest. Adams later arrested one of Jefferson\u2019s pamphleteers during the election of 1800 and tried to prosecute him under the Alien and Sedition Acts. The American tradition of salacious and spurious political attacks is alive and well in the Trump era.\n\n\n\nThe New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, a Supreme Court case from 1964, set a formidable threshold for defamation claims by public figures like Nunes. The justices cited a \u201cprofound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open,\u201d even if it includes \u201cvehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\u201d The tweets against Nunes appear to fall well within those bounds. But Nunes ignores that landmark ruling (perhaps because, like Justice Clarence Thomas, he would like to see Sullivan overturned). Instead, he cites a smattering of other cases to defend his \u201cfundamental constitutional interest and entitlement to the uninterrupted enjoyment of his reputation.\u201d One of his longest citations isn\u2019t from law, but a passage from Shakespeare\u2019s Othello in which Iago bemoans that \u201che that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him, And makes me poor indeed.\u201d\n\nSo why embark on what appears to be a doomed legal endeavor? Perhaps Nunes genuinely believes he\u2019s the victim of a conspiracy theory by Democrats and America\u2019s foreign adversaries. If there\u2019s evidence to support this, Nunes doesn\u2019t offer it. \u201cThe full scope of the conspiracy, including the names of all participants and the level of involvement of donors and members of the Democratic Party, is unknown at this time and will be the subject of discovery in this action,\u201d he noted in the complaint. In other words, Nunes wants to go on a fishing expedition to satiate his political grievances, and he wants the courts to light the way.\n\nOr maybe Nunes is trying to use the legal system to get revenge on his political opponents. Defending oneself against litigation is onerous even for those with the financial means to fight back. (Mair urged her Twitter followers on Monday night to donate to her legal defense fund.) The rich have always wielded the American legal system as a cudgel against critics, as Peter Thiel did in financing the Hulk Hogan lawsuit that ultimately killed Gawker. That a member of Congress would attempt to do so is deeply disturbing.\n\nNunes\u2019s largely anonymous Twitter critics cast him as a shameless partisan hack\u2014someone who abuses power and the legal process to injure his political opponents, who plays fast and loose with the truth to advance partisan goals, and who\u2019s prone to conspiratorial thinking on the flimsiest of grounds. They say he lacks the temperament and honor to serve on the House Intelligence Committee and safeguard the nation\u2019s secrets. His lawsuit only proves them right."

      "Brian Goldstone"
    ],
    "text": "He addresses his father, but his father doesn\u2019t seem to hear, we don\u2019t know why not. Although they stand close together, neither can reach the other. Sometimes they touch, they come into physical contact, but even in these moments they are apart.\n\nTheir estrangement has a salutary effect, creating the distance from which to reconsider the past. A kind of righteous anger gradually replaces judgment. Nowhere is this truer than in Louis\u2019s discussion of his father\u2019s choice to leave school at the age of 14. Initially, Louis explains that fateful decision as a result of \u201cmasculine pride\u201d; there\u2019s frustration that his father wanted to prove, above all other considerations, that he didn\u2019t give a shit. \u201cConstructing your masculinity meant depriving yourself of any other life, any other future, any other prospect that school might have opened up. Your manhood condemned you to poverty.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, only a couple of pages later, he relates an episode that subtly reverses this formulation. Louis is twelve, in grade school, and he has just learned for the first time about the Berlin Wall. He\u2019s fascinated and disturbed. (\u201cThe fact that a major city, not so far away from us, could be divided in two, practically overnight, by a wall, came over me like a storm.\u201d) Later, at home, he begs his father to tell him more: What was it like? Why exactly was it built? Could you ever see your loved ones if they lived on the other side? His father says nothing. \u201cI started to see that my nagging was causing you pain,\u201d Louis writes. \u201cI used words you didn\u2019t understand.\u201d Still, he keeps pushing, and his father erupts.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t the way you usually lost your temper. It wasn\u2019t normal, the way you snapped. You were ashamed because I was confronting you with a school culture that had excluded you, that had wanted you out. Where is history? The history they taught us at school was not your own. World history was what they taught us, and you were left out of the world.\n\nLouis\u2019s father, like his grandfather and great-grandfather, had been expelled from the realm of culture and education long before he chose to leave it behind. His masculine pride was not the cause but a by-product of this exclusion. It was poverty that condemned him to manhood.\n\nAs Louis revisits the story he\u2019s been telling himself about his father, he starts to discover a new perspective on their relationship. \u201cFrom my childhood I have no happy memories,\u201d reads the first line of The End of Eddy. \u201cSuffering is all-consuming: it somehow gets rid of anything that doesn\u2019t fit into its system.\u201d Now, with the benefit of time and space, and a different name, these memories seep back in; what Eddy couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t see, \u00c9douard finally can. Some are minor, nearly imperceptible: a quick smile in the rearview mirror, his father\u2019s moist eyes while watching an opera telecast. A goofy face\u2014\u201cLook Papa, I\u2019m an alien!\u201d\u2014that elicits laughter. Waking up, on his eighth birthday, to discover the Titanic video box set at the foot of his bed; his father had said no, that\u2019s for girls, but surprised him at the last minute. And then, at ten years old, pictures in an old mildewed photo album of his father, from about a decade earlier, dressed as a woman, a cheerleader.\n\nAll my life I\u2019d seen you sneer at any sign of femininity in a man.... I pored over those images all night long\u2014your body, your body in a skirt, the wig on your head, the lipstick on your mouth, the fake breasts under your tee shirt. You must have stuffed cotton wadding in a bra. The most surprising thing to me was that you looked happy. You were smiling. I stole one of the photos and several times a week I would take it out of the drawer where I\u2019d hidden it and try to decipher it. I never mentioned it to you.\n\nAnguished at the sight of that body now wrecked and ruined, Louis identifies, in the book\u2019s final section, the people and forces he believes precipitated this condition. There\u2019s nothing natural, he contends, about a 50-year-old man unable to breathe or walk on his own. Abandoned by the state and useless to the market, his father belongs to a category of people whose suffering confirms, as the cultural historian Michael Denning has put it, that under contemporary capitalism \u201cthe only thing worse than being exploited is not being exploited.\u201d They can be exposed to illness and premature death at no real cost to the prevailing order. \u201cThere are murderers,\u201d Louis writes, \u201cwho are never named for their murders.\u201d If the book\u2019s title ever contained a question mark, it\u2019s been removed. What remains is a statement, an accusation: They did this to him.\n\nIf the book\u2019s title ever contained a question mark, it\u2019s been removed. What remains is a statement, an accusation: They did this to him.\n\nHe lists a procession of culprits from across the political spectrum. Jacques Chirac, Xavier Bertrand, Nicolas Sarkozy, Martin Hirsch, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Myriam El Khomri, Manuel Valls, Emmanuel Macron: Whether adding work requirements to state benefits\u2014forcing his father, despite his back injury, to take a job as a street sweeper\u2014or cutting coverage for essential medications, these are the politicians who destroyed his father\u2019s intestines, mangled his spine, and asphyxiated him. Louis cites, as emblematic of these vindictive policies, President Macron\u2019s decision in 2017 to reduce by five euros per month the housing subsidies for France\u2019s poorest citizens; that same month, Macron\u2019s government announced a tax break for the rich. \u201cThe ruling class,\u201d Louis writes, \u201cmay complain about a left-wing government, they may complain about a right-wing government, but no government ever ruins their digestion, no government ever breaks their backs.\u201d For his father and those like him, on the other hand, \u201cpolitics was a question of life or death.\u201d\n\nLouis\u2019s indictment echoes what has become a battle cry among the French precariat. In November of last year, the gilets jaunes or Yellow Vests movement spontaneously erupted throughout the country, with hundreds of thousands of men and women, many of them hailing from the rural provinces, blocking the roads and roundabouts leading into nearly every town in France. The diffuse, leaderless uprising began in opposition to a planned fuel tax but soon turned into a denunciation of economic injustice more broadly. They saw Macron, who has a habit of speaking derisively of the working class (and pushing \u201creforms\u201d that disproportionately hurt them), as merely the latest face of elite contempt for the poor. Louis, not surprisingly, has been a vocal supporter of the protests. If The End of Eddy gave the French literary public a window onto the social world of people they didn\u2019t know existed (or whose existence they had gladly ignored), Who Killed My Father is a crucial text for a moment when those people are refusing to die quietly.\n\nIn a recent essay, \u201cCan the Yellow Vests Speak?,\u201d Louis described his shock at the first published images of the gilets jaunes .\n\nI saw bodies who almost never appear in the public and media space\u2014suffering bodies ravaged by work, by fatigue, by hunger, by the permanent humiliation of the dominated by the dominant, by social and geographical exclusion.\u2026 The bodies that I saw in the photos looked like my father\u2019s, my brother\u2019s, my aunts\u2019. They looked like the bodies of my family, the inhabitants of the village where I lived as a child, of these people whose health is devastated by poverty and misery. Of those people who\u2014rightly\u2014constantly repeated, day after day throughout my childhood, \u201cWe count for nothing, no one talks about us.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging the far right\u2019s presence in the protests (commentators immediately seized on reports of demonstrators chanting racist and xenophobic slogans), Louis, like many activists, insisted that the uprising was still taking shape and its political orientation was \u201cnot yet fixed in place.\u201d Any social movement, he argued, presents an opportunity to subvert and destabilize language, so that old objects of scorn can be supplanted by more appropriate targets, producing unexpected alliances. Such had already happened with the gilets jaunes , as France\u2019s white rural poor and largely nonwhite urban poor united in an attempt to unmask their country\u2019s leaders\u2014or to enact what Louis, in a 2015 manifesto co-written with Geoffroy de Lagasnerie, defiantly termed the \u201cprinciple of the redistribution of shame.\u201d\n\nA group of Yellow Vest protesters at Le Havre in Normandy in late December 2018 Jean Gaumy/Magnum Photos\n\nOn the last page of the book, Louis\u2019s father comes to embody this possibility. A fervent admirer of Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Front, his father had long ago latched on to the only party, as he saw it, willing to diagnose the system under which he suffered. But his views have undergone a shift: \u201cYou used to say the problem with France was the foreigners and the homosexuals,\u201d Louis writes, \u201cand now you criticize French racism. You ask me to tell you about the man I love.... You changed from one day to the next.\u201d Louis doesn\u2019t really explain the transformation, and, as presented in the book, with its tone of profound alienation, this abrupt, somewhat shocking ending has the feeling of a dream, if not a miracle. But then the emergence of the gilets jaunes, too, has been called miraculous.\n\nLast month, when I came to see you, you asked me before I left, Are you still involved in politics? ... Yes , I told you, more and more involved . You let three or four seconds go by. Then you said, You\u2019re right. You\u2019re right\u2014what we need is a revolution.\n\nPerhaps the son, improbably, has been able to resuscitate his father."

    "text": "This deep investment is evident in the numbers: In addition to dominating Stuyvesant, Asians comprise 62 percent of the student body at Bronx Science, and 61 percent at Brooklyn Tech. New York City\u2019s public school population itself is 16 percent Asian. (White students are also overrepresented, garnering 27 percent of offers to specialized high schools this year, despite the fact that they make up 15 percent of the city\u2019s students.) Their outsized presence makes them wary of change, particularly since de Blasio didn\u2019t offer Asian-American communities any kind of recompense for a proposal that would disproportionately affect them. They would just have to take the hit.\n\nAsian-American community groups were blindsided by the mayor, whose office failed to consult them before the proposal went public. Shino Tanikawa, a school integration advocate, told me that de Blasio\u2019s proposal was part of a depressingly familiar pattern of Asian-Americans either being lumped in with white people or brushed aside. Tanikawa agreed that the admissions system needs to be reformed, but pointed out that for de Blasio \u201cto not even talk to any Asian community leaders before he made the announcement, it\u2019s disrespectful. It\u2019s another example of, what about us, do we not exist?\u201d\n\nRichard Carranza, New York City\u2019s new school chancellor, made matters worse when he bluntly told a local news organization, \u201cI just don\u2019t buy into the narrative that any one ethnic group owns admission to these schools.\u201d And by failing to get buy-in from New York\u2019s Asian-American community, de Blasio undermined his own project. \u201cThose people are needed,\u201d Mae Lee, executive director of the Chinese Progressive Association, told me, referring to the mainly Chinese-American contingent that is rallying against de Blasio\u2019s plan. \u201cWe need to draw those people in more and it\u2019s not being done.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that it was easy to read de Blasio\u2019s announcement as a cynical political move. He campaigned on integrating specialized high schools in 2013, but he let the issue languish until this summer. De Blasio has often said that his hands are tied because reforming the admissions system needs approval by the state legislature, but he also announced it less than a month before the end of the legislative session, meaning that it was almost surely going to be shunted to next year\u2014which is exactly what ended up happening. And if he wanted to, de Blasio could re-designate five of the specialized high schools and change their admissions policies on his own.\n\nUnless New York gets rid of elite schools altogether, which some advocates have in fact proposed, it will have to diversify them in some way.\n\nFurthermore, the focus on specialized high schools, which make up only 6 percent of the city\u2019s entire public high school system, fails to address the greater, systemic problem of school segregation throughout the city. \u201cIt really is a challenging issue because it ends up being a debate about a small number of schools that you can\u2019t really have without opening up a much bigger questions about screening,\u201d said Halley Potter, a fellow at The Century Foundation who focuses on integration policy in New York. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that a year from now we can look back and say this is just one of multiple fronts that the administration has been looking at to tackle segregation.\u201d Addressing just a few high schools out of an entire K-12 system is, in many ways, a distraction from the bigger issues.\n\nStill, the fact remains that specialized high schools are in dire need of integration. Unless New York gets rid of elite schools altogether, which some advocates have in fact proposed, it will have to diversify them in some way. This inevitably means that Asian-Americans will have to figure out where they fit into this new reality\u2014and, perhaps, reassess their political priorities when it comes to their kids and New York City\u2019s school system.\n\nSanchez took me to a small park in Castle Hill not far from where she grew up, before she moved to a one-bedroom apartment in Morris Park with her mother, her mother\u2019s boyfriend, and her three siblings. Sanchez now finally has her own bedroom, an exciting development that she told me she is definitely \u201cstill not over.\u201d When we first started speaking, Sanchez was a little nervous, but quickly opened up about her experiences. Despite her criticisms of New York\u2019s school system, Sanchez cheerfully pointed out all the things she loves about Stuyvesant\u2014her peers and teachers, the fact that Tribeca is \u201creally nice.\u201d She told me that she wants to go to Wesleyan, but is worried about burdening her mother with the cost of tuition\u2014a whole other educational system they\u2019ll have to navigate.\n\nThe test\u2019s proponents claim that the SHSAT is the only truly meritocratic method of admitting students into specialized schools, and that getting rid of it will compromise these schools\u2019 academic integrity. This is despite the fact that the test itself has been subject to very little evaluation. In August, the education news site Chalkbeat obtained through a public records request a 2013 study from the mayor\u2019s office that de Blasio declined to release, showing that the SHSAT is a strong predictor of academic achievement. Yet outside experts told Chalkbeat that the study didn\u2019t answer the question of whether alternative admissions methods would admit just as strong or even better students.\n\n\n\nHsin, the sociology professor, told me, \u201cIf you were to put aside any concerns about goals of diversity at all and you just wanted to come up with mechanism for identifying the most talented individuals to be admitted to specialized high schools, you would never come up with the admissions policy you have now.\u201d Grades, which are repeated measures over time, are considered better indicators of academic acumen. It\u2019s also been shown that they are better than standardized test scores when it comes to predicting success for black and Latinx students.\n\nAnd if you put aside the evidence\u2014or lack thereof\u2014regarding the effectiveness of the test, defending the status quo means defending the idea that admitting black and Latinx students would bring down the quality of the student body, as New York Times reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones has pointed out.\n\nThis racist principle is baked into the history of the admissions policy itself. The original bill that mandated the use of a single standardized test was passed in 1971 by state legislators in order to preempt moves by the city to try to make the specialized schools more diverse. According to Politico, state legislators at the time argued that the bill would \u201cprotect the current status and quality of specialized academic high schools in New York City.\u201d\n\nSanchez told me that many of her peers at Stuyvesant have been talking about the mayor\u2019s proposal since it came out. Common remarks that she\u2019s heard include things like, \u201cPeople aren\u2019t being accepted because they aren\u2019t smart\u201d and \u201cStuy is ruined.\u201d I asked her how she feels when she hears those responses. Sanchez paused for a beat, then said, \u201cI think it\u2019s just insensitive to think that way.\u201d\n\nAsians in America have long sat at the messy crux where minority politics and education meet. They are often the poster-children of conservative attempts to roll back affirmative action and integration, despite being some of these policies\u2019 biggest beneficiaries. The model minority myth\u2014the idea that Asians are successful because they have better values and work harder than other minorities\u2014is pervasive, and often used as a cudgel by whites against black and Latinx Americans for their supposedly wayward values and lax worth ethic.\n\nThe sight of Asian-Americans marching against integration efforts in New York City plays into these storylines. It is why Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department is siding with Asian-American students challenging affirmative action programs at Harvard, which they say discriminate against them by privileging less qualified students.\n\nA survey shows that the Asian-American opposition to affirmative action is almost entirely driven by Chinese-Americans.\n\nHow did they reach this point? For one, because most of the Asian adult population are immigrants, they lack a lived understanding of America\u2019s racial history. Asians have been excluded by this country\u2019s racist immigration policies (see: the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882), but they have also benefited from the loosening of immigration laws in 1965 that brought in more highly educated Asian immigrants. Those trends are set to accelerate: The foreign-born population in the U.S. is at a record high thanks to Asians, according to new Census data, and more Asians with college degrees are expected to emigrate to the country in coming years.\n\nThere is also the glaring fact that Asian-Americans\u2014who hail from a vast continent composed of different cultures and ethnicities\u2014are far from a unified group. In fact, a survey by AAPI Data, a policy research site, shows that the Asian-American opposition to affirmative action is almost entirely driven by Chinese-Americans.\n\nHistorically, Chinese-Americans have been on both sides of the civil rights divide. OiYan Poon, a professor at Colorado State University, noted two examples that should have resonance for Asian-Americans involved in the ongoing controversies surrounding minority rights and education. First was the case of Gong Lum, a Chinese immigrant who lived in the Jim Crow South in the 1920s. When Lum\u2019s daughter was placed in a colored school, he sued, trying to get his daughter into the local white school. Lum lost the case in Supreme Court, but the battle he chose to fight\u2014securing the privileges of whiteness for his daughter, rather than against a racist system\u2014is instructive. \u201cYou can imagine how that case could have been a different possibility,\u201d Poon pointed out. \u201cIt could have been Brown vs. Board of Education. Instead Gong Lum argued, \u2018We want to be white.\u2019\u201d\n\nPoon juxtaposed this approach with the 1974 Supreme Court case Lau v. Nichols, in which Chinese students who weren\u2019t fluent in English had been recently integrated into the San Francisco Unified School District, which wasn\u2019t providing them with English language instruction. The parents of Kinney Kinmon Lau, along with other non-English-speaking Chinese parents, argued that their Fourteenth Amendment rights were being violated since their children did not have equal educational opportunities. They won the case and secured the right to supplemental language education for non-English speaking minorities across the board. In collaboration with the Latinx community, Poon explained, the Chinese community was able to \u201cpush for systemic transformation and totally new possibilities.\u201d\n\nIn New York today, members of the Asian community have lined up behind a system that results in blatant racial disparities. And they are doing so without examining the costs this system extracts, alongside the clear benefits it provides to a select few. The SHSAT effectively functions as a tax on poor Asian immigrants, both in terms of the actual dollars spent on prep courses as well as the years of childhood spent studying for a test that has little real-world relevance. \u201cThirteen- and 14-year olds don\u2019t want to spend a lot of their sixth and seventh grade locked up in a classroom on weekends preparing for this dumb test,\u201d Jade Wong, a daughter of Chinese immigrants and a senior at Brooklyn Tech, told me.\n\nLam said that when her mother found out about de Blasio\u2019s plan, even she acknowledged that \u201cmaybe now certain students can focus more on their grades in middle school, focus into getting into a high school they would actually like to go, that they won\u2019t have to study hours and hours to get into.\u201d Potter, the education policy researcher, pointed out that in Brooklyn\u2019s 15th District, which is going through a similar debate about integration and screening, she found that even advocates of screening recognized that the system felt broken. \u201cIf we started with this premise around specialized high schools,\u201d Potter said, \u201cwe would find many folks in the Asian American community for whom that would resonate.\u201d\n\nIn a broader sense, these specialized schools not only fail the black and Latinx community, but cannot even serve the vast bulk of the disadvantaged Asian-American community. Forgotten in the debate are the Asian children who are turned away; the ones who get in, but then struggle with mental health issues; the ones who would have flourished in different or more diverse schools.\n\nDespite media headlines that might indicate otherwise, the city\u2019s Asian-American community\u2014which, again, includes an impossible multitude of ethnicities and immigrant experiences\u2014is far from unified in opposition to the mayor\u2019s plan. In July, a group of Asian-American alumni from specialized high schools published an op-ed that called for reform of the admissions process, writing, \u201cAsian Americans ought to stand in solidarity with all marginalized communities by advocating for equity in the educational opportunities and outcomes of all New York City students.\u201d That same week, Asian-Pacific American community groups released a statement arguing that \u201cdiverse and inclusive school environments are beneficial to all students\u201d and that the city needs to \u201caddress inequities in education across Pre-K through 12th grade and examine current processes and admission policies.\u201d\n\nBarring action from politicians, Asian parents will also have to be convinced that there are alternative paths to success in this country, and that the binary of \u201ctest or no test\u201d is failing all minorities in one way or another. As Lam put it to me, \u201cIt would benefit parents to know that it doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\u201d"

    "text": "Trump regularly denies that climate change is real, once tweeting that it was \u201ccreated by and for the Chinese\u201d to make America less economically competitive. Since taking office, he\u2019s withdrawn the United States from the Paris climate agreement, championed the U.S. coal mining industry over renewable energy, and placed dogmatic deregulators in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency. Trump once reportedly told aides that he wasn\u2019t worried about the national debt because \u201cI won\u2019t be here.\u201d That attitude also sums up his, and most Republicans\u2019, approach to climate change.\n\nBut their nonchalance is at odds with public opinion on the issue. A Yale/George Mason University poll in February found that fewer than 60 percent of Americans worried about climate change before Trump\u2019s election; that number is now approaching 70 percent. The Obama administration had signed international climate accords and pushed the Clean Power Plan to rein in carbon emissions, giving the appearance of progress on the issue. By shattering those relatively modest efforts, Trump and his allies may inadvertently have convinced more Americans to support climate action.\n\nAmericans, like other animals, occasionally devour their young. The last two decades of policy have not been kind to millennials. Thanks to the Great Recession, they earn less money than boomers and Generation X did at their age. They\u2019re buying fewer homes, paying off their student debts more slowly, and putting less money into their savings. Millennials enjoy far less economic and social stability than their parents did, and it\u2019s taking a psychic toll. Oh, and the world is ending.\n\nThere\u2019s a cottage industry, especially within conservative circles, that tries to blame young Americans for their own problems. Millennials are cast as lazy, coddled, and censorious, thus the supposed proliferation of \u201csafe spaces\u201d and \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d on college campuses and the push for better labor conditions in the workplace. Fox News, whose average viewer is 65 years old, is particularly fond of describing young Americans as naive and out of touch. This backlash is nothing new: A Gallup poll after the Kent State shootings in 1970 found that 58 percent of Americans blamed the students after National Guard fired into a crowd of protesters, killing four students.\n\nAmericans\u2019 views on climate change vary significantly by age. A January survey by Data for Progress found that a majority of millennials and Generation X support the Green New Deal, while a majority of boomers and the Silent Generation oppose it. The generational divide is even apparent among conservatives. In a May 2018 Pew survey, only 44 percent of Republican millennials said they wanted to expand offshore oil and gas drilling compared to 71 percent of Republican boomers. A similar gap\u201443 percent of young Republicans versus 73 percent of older ones\u2014emerged on support for expanded coal mining. What explains this stark age gap? Older Americans tend to be more conservative in general, and they would bear the highest costs for combating climate change while seeing the least benefit from them.\n\nLike the Vietnam protesters of the \u201960s and \u201970s, millennials have shown a knack for mass organizing. Students at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, led nationwide protests against gun violence after 17 of their classmates were massacred last year. The March for Our Lives last year became one of the largest national demonstrations in U.S. history, drawing almost 200,000 people in Washington, D.C., alone. Thunberg, the 16-year-old activist who spoke at Davos, cited their work as an inspiration for the student strikes.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, young also seem to have avoided some of the pitfalls that anti-war protesters fell into almost 50 years ago. Young people also seem to understand that they need to wield political power through the governing process, not just outside of it. Trump\u2019s presidency prompted hundreds of Democratic millennials to run for elected office, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress and the Green New Deal\u2019s highest-profile champion.\n\n\n\nMillennials also seem to have rejected violence as a political tactic. Though the anti-war movement as a whole wasn\u2019t violent, parts of, notably the Weather Underground, committed domestic terrorism. It was also a remarkably violent era in general: The FBI tabulated more than 2,700 bombings in the U.S. in an 18-month span between 1971 and 1972. That helped fuel an electoral backlash from moderates and conservatives, aiding Nixon\u2019s election bids in 1968 and 1972. The anti-war movement ultimately succeeded in shifting public opinion against the war, and Nixon\u2014fresh off his reelection rout of George McGovern, who had advocated for immediate withdrawal\u2014wound down America\u2019s involvement in Vietnam. But the cost was a generational shift toward conservatism.\n\nThe impact of rising global temperatures on civilization will dwarf the Vietnam War\u2019s bloodshed.\n\nThe Vietnam War was a clear mortal threat to young people, tens of millions of whom were eligible to be drafted; nearly 60,000 Americans were killed in the conflict. Climate change presents a different sort of threat to millennials. It\u2019s less immediate than an ongoing war, less visceral than being shot at. But ultimately it will prove more catastrophic. Even if drastic action is taken over the next decade, the impact of rising global temperatures on civilization will dwarf the Vietnam War\u2019s bloodshed. The World Health Organization has projected that come 2030, climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year.\n\nCombatting climate change will take much more effort than ending the Vietnam War, and much longer. It will require a mass movement unlike any America, or even the world, has ever seen. It will also require millennials to succeed where the anti-war left failed a half-century ago: at the ballot box. There can\u2019t be meaningful action as long as climate deniers and slow-walkers are in charge in Washington. The challenge will be to convince enough older voters that global warming is every bit as frightening to millennials as the Vietnam War was to boomers.\n\n\u201cAdults keep saying, \u2018We owe it to the young people to give them hope,\u2019\u201d Thunberg, who was nominated Wednesday for the Nobel Peace Prize, said in January. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want your hope. I don\u2019t want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And then I want you to act. I want you to act as you would in a crisis. I want you to act as if our house is on fire. Because it is.\u201d"

      "David C. Atkinson"
    ],
    "text": "On Friday, an Australian white supremacist committed a monstrous act of violence against Muslim worshippers in New Zealand. The attack, which he live streamed, was steeped in the kind of global iconography and discourse that characterizes modern white supremacy. The assailant played a song about convicted Serbian war criminal Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107 as he approached the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch, and his weapons bore further testament to the global resonances of contemporary white supremacy: One rifle apparently eulogized a Swedish girl who was murdered by an Uzbek immigrant in Stockholm, while another celebrated a Frankish nobleman who fought Muslim armies in Western France over a millennium ago. His manifesto cited U.S. white supremacist mass murderer Dylann Roof as inspiration, and featured a diagram promoted by U.S. white supremacist David Duke on its cover.\n\nIn any attack like this, it is important to look at the particulars: the online hate speech the perpetrator absorbed, for example, which has proliferated in recent years. But it is equally important to remember that this latest outrage, and similar barbarities elsewhere, are not anomalies: White supremacy has a long, global history, and New Zealand and Australia have played central and interrelated roles in that history. This most recent horror is not just testament to a more recent uptick in far-right violence. It is also the latest episode in the ongoing story of antipodean white supremacism at the heart of both New Zealand\u2019s and Australia\u2019s national histories. And then, as now, American white supremacy has been intimately linked to that story.\n\nThe first victims of white supremacy in New Zealand and Australia, where the latest killer was born, were indigenous inhabitants. But by the late nineteenth century, white colonials had also turned that sentiment against the imagined influx of \u201cundesirable\u201d immigrants from Asia. The gold rushes of the 1850s brought the first Chinese migrants to both Australia and New Zealand. Curiosity turned to hostility as the mines were exhausted and Chinese miners moved off in search of other opportunities. By the 1880s, both New Zealand and the Australian self-governing colonies had enacted immigration regulations that made Chinese immigration prohibitively expensive and therefore nearly impossible.\n\nRemoteness from Britain and proximity to Asia, white New Zealanders and Australians proclaimed toward the end of the nineteenth century, would bring racial degeneration and ruinous economic competition unless they maintained a total commitment to white territorial, political, and economic control. As one representative explained to the Victorian Parliament in 1899, \u201cwe have a territory with a suitable climate, but with a sparse population, while on the other hand, we have quite adjacent to our shores hundreds of millions of a very undesirable class of people.\u201d The same sentiments were echoed in legislative bodies, newspapers, and trade union halls all over Australia and New Zealand, and the same solution was repeatedly volunteered. In the words of that same Victorian legislator: \u201cIt should be one of our ideals to maintain, if possible, a pure Australian blood, or a pure British blood, or a pure British and European blood, within the shores of Australia.\u201d"

    "text": "The current debate surrounding court-packing may lack depth, but it\u2019s rapidly growing in breadth. A network of liberal groups and activists have taken up the issue, including Indivisible and the aptly named Pack the Courts. Harvard law professors Laurence Tribe and Mark Tushnet formed the 1.20.21 Project, which calls for four additional Supreme Court seats and an expanded bench in the lower federal courts. A poll in November by Fix the Court, a nonprofit judicial watchdog group, found that 42 percent of Democrats would favor court-packing over other structural reforms for the high court, like term limits.\n\n\n\nThis strategy isn\u2019t without pitfalls. For starters, any packed Supreme Court majority could prove to be only transitory. With the court-packing taboo broken, there would be nothing to stop the GOP from expanding it again whenever they next take both houses of Congress and the presidency. The result would transform the Supreme Court into something closer to Britain\u2019s House of Lords, where governments can simply add new members whenever they want to secure control of the chamber. The only way court-packing would give liberals a permanent victory is if the GOP never took full control of the government\u2014an unlikely prospect at best.*\n\nCourt-packing\u2019s proponents haven\u2019t yet made the case for such extraordinary measures. Some on the left point to justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh as justification enough. \u201cWe don\u2019t consider those two seats that Trump has filled to be legitimate,\u201d Brian Fallon, the executive director of Demand Justice, a leading liberal judicial advocacy group, told The Washington Post. Gorsuch in particular is viewed as illegitimate. In 2016, after Antonin Scalia\u2019s death, McConnell refused to allow a vote on Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, Merrick Garland; Trump, once president, then nominated Gorsuch. McConnell later called his decision to block Garland\u2019s nomination \u201cthe most consequential thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\n\nMcConnell will be damned in American history for his shameless hyper-partisanship, but his actions did not amount to an illegitimate theft of the seat. The president has every right to nominate a Supreme Court justice, and the Senate has every right to ignore him. McConnell\u2019s decision essentially turned the 2016 presidential election into a referendum on the future of the Supreme Court. Republicans saw the stakes\u2014the first five-justice liberal bloc since the Warren Court\u2014and rallied behind the least-qualified major-party presidential candidate in the history of the republic. Democrats and the left stayed home in key states. And while Kavanaugh\u2019s behavior during the confirmation hearings should have disqualified him from a seat on the court, the Senate disagreed.\n\nWhat\u2019s left is a raw utilitarian argument. The Supreme Court likely will be a bulwark of conservative legal rulings for the next generation. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer are 85 and 80 years old, respectively. Justice Clarence Thomas, the oldest conservative justice, once reportedly vowed to serve on the court until the 2030s. Democrats could win every federal election until then and still see their legislative projects\u2014Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and more\u2014struck down by the court."

    "text": "America\u2019s founders probably would not have been surprised by former Attorney General Eric Holder\u2019s statement last week that if he were president\u2014though he\u2019s not running\u2014and the Democrats controlled Congress, he would \u201cseriously consider adding two seats to the Supreme Court\u201d to counteract Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s \u201cpower-grabbing antics.\u201d The same goes for a competing proposal from South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is running for president, seeking to expand the court to 15 justices. Within 20 years of establishing the new federal government, our early statesmen had changed the size of the Supreme Court three times to ensure that a politically hostile judiciary did not thwart the goals of the party controlling Congress and the presidency.\n\nThe Constitution does not entrust to public officials the responsibility to check their own power. The founders assumed that people with political muscle (including judges) would show little self-restraint, and they built a government that would provide each branch with many checks against the others. The Supreme Court was no exception. Rather than leaving the size of the Court in the hands of the justices, or fixing the size for all time, the Constitution grants that power to Congress. As soon-to-be Justice Robert Jackson testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1937, \u201cIt was obvious at the founding of the Government that the Court would not always remain of the same size, and that changes in its size would be made, as they have been made, at those times when its decisions caused dissatisfaction.\u201d\n\nCritics of Holder\u2019s remarks, including at The New Republic, argue that if Democrats violate the \u201cnorm\u201d of a nine-person court, Republicans will do the same once they return to power. This tit-for-tat allegedly will spell the end to an independent judiciary and our democracy.\n\nSuch end-time worries are nothing new. When Congress voted to increase the size of the Court during the Jefferson administration, one newspaper wrote that \u201cthe Constitution has received a wound that it will not long survive.\u201d Another lamented: \u201cThe independence of the judicial power is prostrated. A judge, instead of holding his position for life, will hold it during the good pleasure of the dominant party. The judges will of course become partisans, and the shadow of justice alone will remain in our courts.\u201d Despite these histrionics, a moment\u2019s reflection on the history of the Court shows that it remained fiercely independent after each of the seven instances in which Congress changed its size. It is difficult to believe that a future expansion of the Court would break this mold."

    "text": "The notion that the GOP is the party of fiscal responsibility is one of the most persistent myths in American politics. Republican presidential administrations have consistently driven up the deficit\u2014the amount that government spending exceeds revenue\u2014over the past four decades. The 1981 tax cut signed into law by Ronald Reagan, which slashed the rate for the highest earners from 70 to 50 percent, \u201cled to an explosion in the budget deficit, hitting close to 6 percent of gross domestic product in 1983\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Daniel Drezner observed last year. When that tax cut failed to pay for itself and the deficit ballooned, the Reagan administration responded with a series of largely forgotten tax increases\u2014while also passing the landmark Tax Reform Act of 1986, which further cut the top rate to 28 percent.\n\nReagan\u2019s deficit shenanigans became the playbook for generations of conservative policymakers. \u201cBy creating a fiscal straitjacket through lower taxes, conservatives leave Washington with less money and raise the specter of deficits damaging the economy as a rationale to take away the benefits that millions of Americans depend on,\u201d wrote Julian Zelizer in The Atlantic shortly before Trump signed his cuts into law. George W. Bush, meanwhile, squandered a budget surplus by gifting enormous tax cuts to the rich, then blew up the deficit to pay for two failed wars.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have dutifully focused on reducing the deficit. Bill Clinton began his administration by signing a bill that increased taxes and cut spending; it squeaked through Congress with zero Republican votes. He would go on to embrace the language of fiscal discipline and benefit cuts, signing a welfare reform bill into law that has had devastating reverberations to this day. In a 1993 speech outlining an economic program that would lead to budget surpluses by the end of the decade, Clinton presented deficit reduction as a precursor to social spending. \u201cWe\u2019re not cutting the deficit just because experts say it\u2019s the thing to do, or because it has some intrinsic merit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to cut the deficit because the more we spend paying off the debt, the less tax dollars we have to invest in jobs and education and the future of this country.\u201d (During the 2016 campaign, his wife, Hillary Clinton echoed this line.) By the time Clinton left office, the $290 billion budget deficit he had inherited had been transformed into a $124 billion surplus.\n\nLike Clinton, Obama dealt with a Republican Congress for much of his time in office and made similar concessions and overtures, tailoring budgets and programs like the Affordable Care Act to conservative demands for deficit reduction. Even though Democrats controlled both houses of Congress at the time, the hunt for Republican votes\u2014and perhaps intoxicated by his belief that he could transcend partisan politics\u2014guided much of the bill\u2019s framing. (Obama did also have to contend with the then-powerful conservative Blue Dog Coalition.) The Affordable Care Act was convoluted and made less ambitious in part due to concerns about the deficit\u2014concerns that also guided the administration\u2019s decision to push for smaller stimuluses during the Great Recession than economists recommended, as well as its approach to budget negotiations. If the goal was to control the deficit, it worked. The deficit spiked early in Obama\u2019s presidency due to a combination of Bush leftovers, economic stimulus, and automatic increases in social spending caused by the recession, but he left it roughly where he inherited it.\n\n\n\nWhere has this gotten Democrats, politically? Nowhere. Republicans have consistently rejected Democratic proposals that would reduce the deficit, and there\u2019s no evidence that voters have rewarded Democrats for their fiscal responsibility. But Democrats continue to live in fear of being seen as the party of reckless spending and \u201cfree stuff.\u201d At the start of the current Congress, Nancy Pelosi pushed the Democratic House to adopt archaic and unnecessary pay-as-you-go rules that would require any new spending to be offset by tax increases or spending cuts\u2014a plan that would make bold new policies like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal impossible to pass. As The American Prospect\u2019s Robert Kuttner wrote last month, \u201cDemocrats\u2019 restoring a PAYGO rule ignores a three decades history of getting fleeced, and is worse than nothing. It is like wearing a sign that says to Republicans, \u2018Kick me.\u2019 To the broad voting public it signals nothing at all.\u201d\n\n"

    "text": "PETA, the world\u2019s premier animal rights organization, has been criticized for its tactics, which include comparing the struggle of animals to the struggle of marginalized humans. Oli Scarff/Getty Images\n\nThirty years later, a growing and increasingly vocal group of people beyond the movement proper don\u2019t consider the idea so radical anymore. It\u2019s still a minority viewpoint, but 32 percent of Americans believe animals should have similar protections as humans, according to a 2015 Gallup poll. That number is significantly higher than a 2008 survey finding that 25 percent of people held that belief. Thanks to an expansive nexus of interrelated moral and political concerns, the numbers seem poised to continue spiking, particularly among liberals. At the heart of that nexus is a tentative accord to bring animal rights and animal welfare into alignment with one another\u2014together of course, with human rights and human welfare.\n\nTo get at the underpinnings of this new consensus, let\u2019s start with the environment. The U.S. meat industry is one of the largest sources of water contamination in the country, and a massive contributor to drought in the West. On a global scale, animal agriculture \u201cputs a heavy strain on many of the Earth\u2019s finite land, water, and energy resources,\u201d according to the advocacy group Climate Nexus. \u201cIn order to accommodate the 70 billion animals raised annually for human consumption, a third of the planet\u2019s ice-free land surface, as well as nearly 16 percent of global freshwater, is devoted to growing livestock.\u201d About three quarters of the Brazilian Amazon\u2019s deforestation is attributable to animal agriculture.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s climate change. Agriculture, along with land use and forestry, accounts for a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions globally, with the meat industry making up about one-fifth of those emissions. The biggest emissions source is the animals\u2019 ruminants\u2014a fancy way of saying farts and burps, which get released into the air as methane. Meat agriculture also compounds carbon emissions via widespread deforestation to clear room for raising the animals, and nitrogen-based fertilizer to grow their food.\n\nIn the most immediate way, removing greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector means targeting the meat industry.\n\nIf meat and dairy consumption continue apace, our dietary habits could eventually contribute to an 80 percent spike in global agricultural greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050\u2014which is why any serious plan to tackle climate change has to include restrictions on the animal agriculture sector. The Green New Deal resolution introduced by New York Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example, calls for removing \u201cgreenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is technologically feasible.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a vague suggestion with quite specific implications: In the most immediate way, removing greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector means targeting the meat industry. And targeting the meat industry likely means reducing the number of animals consumed. Thus Republican lawmakers, ever ready to trigger the libs, have taken to claiming that Democrats, in their wild-eyed zeal to stave off an environmental catastrophe that exists only in their overheated imaginations, are going to take away people\u2019s meat. \u201cIf this goes through, this will be outlawed,\u201d Representative Rob Bishop of Utah said of the Green New Deal, as he chewed on a cheeseburger. \u201cI could no longer eat this type of thing.\u201d\n\nBishop, of course, is trolling; the Green New Deal does not ban beef. But he\u2019s also not entirely wrong. It was Peter Singer himself who first raised the issue. \u201cWe are, quite literally, gambling with the future of our planet,\u201d he wrote in Animal Liberation, \u201cfor the sake of hamburgers.\u201d\n\nAnd for the sake of these hamburgers, whose future are we gambling with, specifically?\n\nClimate change is a cataclysm for humans everywhere, but it will be felt more keenly by certain humans. It\u2019s well-documented that minorities, people living in poverty, tribal communities, immigrants, and the elderly suffer disproportionately from problems caused by climate change. These populations are less likely to have the resources and amenities that traditionally protect people from extreme weather, such as soundly built structures, air conditioning, and readily accessible health care.\n\nThe environmental consequences of animal agriculture also markedly skew against the vulnerable. In the United States, \u201cmore than 100,000 miles of rivers and streams, close to 2.5 million acres of lakes, reservoirs and ponds, and more than 800 square miles of bays and estuaries\u201d have poor water quality because of fertilizer runoff partly caused by animal agriculture, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Nutrient pollution has been connected to cancer, birth defects, and the deadly Blue Baby Syndrome\u2014the condition whereby infants deprived of blood oxygen literally turn blue. Water contamination is an especially acute problem for the rural poor, who can\u2019t afford to stockpile bottled water or expensive filtration systems. Fertilizer runoff from meat production has also caused an enormous recurring dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico, threatening the area\u2019s $600 million fishing industry.\n\nThe meat industry is also a disaster for labor.\n\nThe meat industry is also a disaster for labor. Slaughterhouse workers\u2014mainly immigrants and resettled refugees\u2014often face lifelong injuries from their jobs, and likewise are denied the sort of disposable income necessary to treat them. \u201cThey describe punishing rates of production, leaving them with a lifetime of pain and physical problems,\u201d a 2016 NPR report read. \u201cWorkers making on average $12.50 an hour, or about $26,000 a year, say they can get fired if their injuries prevent them from working harder; companies report constant employee turnover.\u201d Those injuries aren\u2019t just physical, but also psychological. \u201cThe worst thing, worse than the physical danger, is the emotional toll,\u201d an Iowa slaughterhouse worker told activist Gail Eisnitz. \u201cPigs down on the kill floor have come up and nuzzled me like a puppy. Two minutes later I had to kill them.\u201d\n\nLeaders on the left wing of the Democratic Party\u2014the only party in this country that can plausibly claim to represent the interests of minorities, low-income workers, immigrants, and other vulnerable people\u2014are perfectly aware of these problems. But their response typically focuses on policy prescriptions aimed at piecemeal solutions rather than more ambitious structural reform. Such proposals include the adoption of new environmental regulations, investment in new technology for low-carbon agriculture, securing a workers\u2019 bill of rights, and expanding workers\u2019 ability to unionize. While these measures, if signed into law under a post-Trump presidency, would certainly start to address some of the environmental and mortal damage caused by animal agriculture, they don\u2019t quite address the crux of the problem.\n\nA more sweeping analytical framework has lately emerged on the left to diagnose a host of ills that are interconnected: The problem, a growing chorus of environmentalists now suggest, might be capitalism itself. Central to this emerging critique is the interpretation of the environmental exploitation of the earth and its inhabitants as a direct outgrowth of unregulated capitalism. Appalling labor conditions, the destruction of the environment in search of profit, a callous disregard toward marginalized communities, the reliance on an unseen underclass to keep the whole bloody machinery running\u2014these are all, in the anticapitalist wing of environmentalism, indelible hallmarks of both the agriculture industry and a rampant market economy. As the essayist Carl Boggs once wrote, \u201cAside from the military, no sector of American society matches the frightening consequences of the meat complex: ecological devastation, food deterioration, routinized violence, injury, disease, and death to both humans and animals, rampant corporate power.\u201d\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal recognizes that massive societal shifts are necessary to stave off climate change\u2014including changes to the agricultural sector. SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThrough proposals like the Green New Deal, the left has recognized that massive societal shifts are necessary to save the planet and achieve equality. And with the Green New Deal\u2019s increasing prominence in the debate over environmental reform, it\u2019s only a matter of time before such shifts will include a serious discussion about the ethics and wisdom of consuming billions of animals every year. Indeed, there are already signs that the discussion has begun: Intercept writer Glenn Greenwald, a fervent animal rights activist, in March launched a video series called Animal Matters, \u201cdevoted to discussions and reporting about all matters concerning animal rights, animal welfare, factory farms, and humanity\u2019s treatment of animals.\u201d\n\nStill, as the reflexive mockery of nearly all things PETA shows, a radical shift in our thinking about animals is hardly under way. It\u2019s tempting to blame this status quo on humanity\u2019s well-documented reluctance to give up bacon and steaks. But the growing recognition in America that animals should be treated \u201chumanely\u201d suggests that there is an opening to argue for reduced meat consumption based on the rights of animals themselves. Such an argument, which would vastly enlarge the pool of historical victims of capitalism\u2019s excesses, would have to learn from the mistakes of the traditional animal rights movement\u2014and atone for more than a few of its sins.\n\nThere will always be some stubborn pocket of popular resistance when it comes to animal rights. Diligent attention to the issue would, after all, require many of us to make a concerted effort not only to stop eating meat, but also to refrain from wearing leather, going to zoos, and doing hundreds of other things based on the exploitation of animals. \u201cUsing animals is a source of pleasure for many people,\u201d said Sue Donaldson, who co-authored with Will Kymlicka the 2011 book Zoopolis: A Political Theory of Animal Rights. \u201cI think strategically, we should support people wherever they are on that transition, and recognize that it\u2019s a difficult thing to do.\u201d That\u2019s one thing the traditional animal-rights movement has never been very good at, and the PETA-led culture of aggressively shaming meat-eaters is something that has to change if people are to embrace animal rights.\n\nCrucially, animal rights activists have to stop comparing the struggle of animals to the struggle of black people in America. Because to many on the old-school human left, animal rights activists aren\u2019t just a bunch of silly vegans. They\u2019re a bunch of racist vegans.\n\nConsider PETA\u2019s infamous tweet about \u201cbringing home the bagels.\u201d In response to some light backlash, the group followed up with this retort:\n\nJust as it became unacceptable to use racist, homophobic, or ableist language, phrases that trivialize cruelty to animals will vanish as more people begin to appreciate animals for who they are and start \u2018bringing home the bagels\u2019 instead of the bacon. \u2014 PETA (@peta) December 4, 2018\n\nPETA makes this comparison all the time, arguing that killing a cow just because it\u2019s a cow is just as bad as killing a black person because she is black. \u201c[We] know that prejudice in all its ugly forms is wrong,\u201d PETA president Ingrid Newkirk wrote in 2017. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who the victim is, but when we witness oppression, we should never let it go unchallenged.\u201d The group, as Sarah Grey and Joe Cleffie argued in a 2015 piece for Jacobin, \u201cis notorious for employing lynching and Holocaust imagery; in 2009, PETA members dressed in Ku Klux Klan robes outside Madison Square Garden to protest the \u2018eugenic\u2019 breeding practices promoted by the Westminster Dog Show.\u201d\n\nPETA\u2019s stance also hails from the founding text of the modern animal rights movement. In Animal Liberation, Peter Singer frequently makes slavery comparisons. He also cites apartheid to argue hypocrisy on the part of well-meaning meat-eaters. \u201cTo protest about bullfighting in Spain, the eating of dogs in South Korea, or the slaughter of baby seals in Canada while continuing to eat eggs from hens who have spent their lives crammed into cages ... is like denouncing apartheid in South Africa while asking your neighbors not to sell their houses to blacks,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut this comparison is flawed and deeply troubling when you consider how racists have long compared oppressed minority groups to dogs and other animals. \u201cThe comparison is calculated to degrade, and it stems from the period when U.S. laws treated enslaved black people as legally equivalent to livestock\u2014categorizing them as subhuman,\u201d Grey and Cleffie write.\n\nTo some, it often feels that people care more about animals than they do about people of color.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that many on the left believe animal rights activism simply serves as a means for white people to ignore the human rights of black people\u2014who, by the way, continue to be oppressed in America. To some, it often feels that people care more about animals than they do about people of color. Burton, who authored the Buzzfeed op-ed on PETA, recalled a conversation in which a woman told her that \u201canimals are treated better by white people than black human beings are.\u201d In a New York Times op-ed, the African-American writer Roxane Gay mourned the shooting of an unarmed black man while the rest of the world mourned the death of Cecil the Lion.\n\nThis is the core problem animal rights groups must atone for, said Will Kymlicka: \u201cWe want other social justice movements to accept animal rights, but it means animal-rights groups need to be much more responsible members of the family.\u201d\n\nHe added, however, that it\u2019s a \u201ctwo-way street.\u201d Social justice movements can\u2019t be too cavalier in dismissing the animals rights movement, because in doing so, they\u2019re arguing that humans are inherently a superior species and thus have moral dominion over the earth. That mindset actually harms the fight for racial, gender, and other social equalities. At least 10 peer-reviewed sociology and psychology studies show that belief in species hierarchy is \u201cconsistently associated with greater dehumanization of disadvantaged or marginalized human groups,\u201d Kymlicka said. \u201cIt exacerbates racism, sexism, homophobia, and reduces support for fair wages for workers.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAlthough these studies are looking at different age groups in different countries using different methods, the finding is always the same: Species hierarchy is bad for social justice movements.\u201d\n\nEvery year in the United States, humans bring about 8.5 billion chickens, 33 million cows, and 112 million pigs into the world for the sole purpose of killing them and serving them on a plate. To most Americans this is a non-issue. Worse, if Democrats were to make lowering meat consumption, by fiat or policy nudges, part of their platform, it would likely be a losing issue.\n\nBut if the last few years have shown us anything, it\u2019s that the assumptions that once undergirded American politics\u2014about what voters want, about the supremacy of the free market, about the very foundations of liberal democracy\u2014are now open to fresh interrogation. The left has seized that opportunity to push the boundaries of debate on a host of subjects, from the economy to the environment to movement-based crusades for social justice. In so doing they have made certain implicit promises. Taken to their logical ends, their proposals suggest the outlines of a broad, holistic case for humans eating much less meat\u2014a case that includes aspects of animal welfare and animal rights.\n\nThis is not to say that animal rights should or will become an all-or-nothing proposition. Policy makers will have to meet voters where they are, while proposing an array of approaches that range from the oblique to the direct. But the benefits of convincing people to eat less meat are clear. Production would decrease. Emissions from livestock would drop. Waterways would flush out pollution; aquifers would replenish. Billions of lives would be saved, human lives very much among them.\n\nOr, you know, we could keep eating hamburgers."

    "text": "I.Q. testers also tended to be passionate devotees of child-centered education. Though they are often associated with classification and selection, the tests in fact embodied a much broader theory of aptitude development. Their earliest supporters were relentless critics of traditional pedagogy, complaining that it was designed for the convenience of adults rather than the needs of children, and arguing that teaching should be based on the unfolding abilities of children, as revealed by I.Q. tests. Alfred Binet invented I.Q. tests to identify slow-learning children who were having a miserable time trying to keep up with more able contemporaries. One of the first to popularize I.Q. tests in the United States was Granville Stanley Hall, the pioneer of the child-study movement and an enthusiastic advocate of child-centered education. Jean Piaget used I.Q. tests to explore children\u2019s idiosyncratic views of the world. Progressive teachers turned to them in their battle against giant classes and stuffy teaching methods.\n\nUntil the 1950s these psychologists found their most passionate supporters on the left and their bitterest opponents on the right. Labour intellectuals such as R.H. Tawney pointed to intelligence tests to prove that Britain was being disgracefully profligate with the talents of its population. T.S. Eliot argued that an educational system that sorts people according to their native capacities would disorganize society and debase education, breaking the bonds of class and tradition and creating a society of mobile, atomized individuals. Edward Welbourne, a particularly crusty Cambridge don, was even more direct: confronted with the news that a student was interested in I.Q. tests, he snorted, \u201cHuh. Devices invented by Jews for the advancement of Jews.\u201d\n\nWhy were Britain\u2019s intelligence testers so much more palatable than their American colleagues? Partly because they were outsiders, marginal to Britain\u2019s snobbish social and scientific establishment. British psychologists turned to I.Q. tests precisely because they thought that the establishment\u2019s traditional methods of spotting talent\u2014examination essays, Latin translations, viva voce examinations-\u2014were hopelessly biased in favor of the well-taught rather than the promising poor. In America, psychologists were loaded with scientific honors and academic resources. In Britain, they were starved of resources and shunted aside.\n\nBritain also boasted a group of first-rate biologists, such as Lancelot Hogben, J.D. Bernal and J.B.S. Haldane, whose sympathies lay distinctly on the left. They wielded huge influence with both the scientific establishment and the popular media\u2014Haldane, for example, was both a fellow of the Royal Society and a hyperactive newspaper columnist\u2014and they ensured that anybody who wanted to pronounce on controversial questions such as the relationship between race and intelligence had to pass the highest possible test of intellectual rigor and scientific probity. Significantly, the most bigoted British intelligence testers fled to the United States: William McDougall, a psychologist with something of a fetish for blond, blue-eyed types, left Oxford for Harvard, and Raymond Cattell, who argued, in print, that the race was being swamped by \u201csub-men,\u201d later followed him to the States. (Cattell lives in the United States still; a list of supporters of The Bell Curve in The Wall Street Journal included his name.)\n\nYet, for all their progressive sentiments, the intelligence testers fell afoul of two of the most powerful constituencies of the postwar left: the communitarians and the egalitarians. Communitarians such as Michael Young, the author of the 1945 Labour manifesto and now ennobled as Lord Young of Dartington, argued that the 11-plus, an I.Q. test taken by all of Britain\u2019s 11-year-olds, was breaking down working-class communities and churning out alienated, confused, anxiety-ridden scholarship winners. Indeed, his 1959 indictment of intelligence testing, The Rise of Meritocracy, foreshadows many of the central concerns of The Bell Curve, arguing that, as society becomes more efficient at allocating positions according to ability, the elite lose any sense of social responsibility (after all, they have nobody to thank for their success but themselves), and the poor lose any sense of self-respect.\n\nEgalitarians argued that individual differences are the result of social circumstances rather than genetic inheritance, and that comprehensive schools would produce a much more equal society. After a long struggle between meritocrats and egalitarians for the soul of the party, Labour finally came down on the side of egalitarianism in the mid-1960s, with Labour Minister Tony Crosland declaring that he would not rest until he had destroyed \u201cevery fucking grammar school in England. And Wales. And Northern Ireland.\u201d\n\nYet the Labour Party\u2019s rejection of meritocracy has hardly been a success. Communitarianism embodies a nostalgic quest for a lost world, before social mobility turned neighbors into strangers and village greens into asphalt jungles. It also smacks rather too much of the traditional Tory complaint about people not knowing their place. Egalitarian reforms have also proved strikingly counterproductive. The comprehensive schools, introduced by the Labour government in the 1960s, have replaced selection by ability with selection by neighborhood, hardly a triumph for social justice. When Conservatives tried to reintroduce selection by ability in Solihull in the mid-1980s they were met with howls of protest from middle-class parents, who argued that they had paid inflated prices for their houses so that they could get their children into good schools, and didn\u2019t want their children\u2019s school places commandeered by riffraff.\n\nPolicymakers on both sides of the Atlantic would do well to look again at the more enlightened tradition of intelligence testing. The more insightful on the left, led by U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich, but including the British Labour Party\u2019s new leader, Tony Blair, have realized they need to rethink ideas about the state. In a world of gigantic capital flows and globe-spanning production networks, the left has no choice but to abandon its traditional belief in picking industrial sectors or industries to support. Instead of investing in winning companies, the state should make sure it invests in winning people: ensuring that the educational system spots outstandingly promising children and allows them to make the most of their talents.\n\nGiven this agenda, the left can hardly afford to ignore I.Q. tests, which, for all their inadequacies, are still the best means yet devised for spotting talent wherever it occurs, in the inner cities as well as the plush housing estates, and ensuring that that talent is matched to the appropriate educational streams and job opportunities. The left, indeed, should be up in arms about The Bell Curve. But they should be up in arms because Murray and Herrnstein have kidnapped what ought to be one of the left\u2019s most powerful tools for opening opportunities, and have tried to turn it into an excuse for closing doors."

    "text": "This prohibition against war is not some trivial aspiration. Non-intervention is the centerpiece of international law and the United Nations has repeatedly sought to underline its significance. In 1965, the General Assembly declared \u201cNo state or group of states has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any state.\u201d Again in 1970, it unanimously reaffirmed the illegality of \u201carmed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats.\u201d In 1981, the General Assembly further specified that the Charter\u2019s \u201cprinciple of non-intervention and non-interference\u201d prohibited \u201cany \u2026 form of intervention and interference, overt or covert, directed at another State or group of States, or any act of military, political or economic interference in the internal affairs of another State.\u201d\n\nThe United States is currently engaged in active military hostilities in at least seven countries, namely Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Libya, and Niger. That tally doesn\u2019t include drone strikes in Pakistan, combat operations in Kenya, Cameroon, and Central African Republic, or other interventions of unknown magnitude. The true number might be closer to 14 countries. The White House is also explicitly threatening U.S. military action to change the regime in Venezuela and against Iran for a host of spurious reasons. Not one of these cases meets the prerequisites for legal military intervention (a plausible self-defense case can be made for the war in Afghanistan, but it expired a long time ago).\n\nNo other state in the international system uses force more than the U.S. has. Throughout the Cold War, the United States used military means to interfere in other countries about twice as often as did the Soviet Union. This doesn\u2019t include interventions below the threshold of military action: from 1946 to 2000, Washington meddled in foreign elections more than 80 times (compared to 36 by the Soviet Union or Russia over the same period). Covert operations to overthrow democratically elected governments, as in Iran, Guatemala, and Chile, were a staple of U.S. conduct in this period, and according to the Rand Corporation, \u201cthe number and scale of U.S. military interventions rose rapidly in the aftermath of the Cold War.\u201d The Congressional Research Service lists more than 200 individual U.S. military interventions from 1989 to 2018, a rate that no other country even comes close to matching.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for America to act as the guarantor of a rules-based order that it consistently violates. When President Obama condemned Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014, saying international law prohibits redrawing territorial borders \u201cat the barrel of a gun,\u201d it was somewhat awkward: The United States did exactly that in the 1999 Kosovo war, which lacked Security Council approval, and successive administrations have similarly supported Israel as it annexes and occupies territory in violation of international law. Secretary of State John Kerry castigated Russia\u2019s territorial grab this way: \u201cYou just don\u2019t in the 21st century behave in 19th century fashion by invading another country on completely trumped up pretext.\u201d As it happens, that\u2019s a rather apt description of the Bush administration\u2019s brazenly illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003.\n\nWashington often appeals to international law to justify military action against despots who commit atrocities, as it did when it secured UN Security Council approval in 2011 to bomb Libya. But even there, when the initial use of force was authorized, the Obama administration rapidly exceeded the mandate of the resolution by pursuing what amounted to a regime-change strategy. And such appeals to humanitarianism are highly selective: U.S. military power has also been used to assist Saudi Arabia, one of the world\u2019s most regressive authoritarian regimes, commit war crimes and keep an impoverished and largely defenseless population in Yemen under siege."

    "text": "President Mauricio Macri of Argentina, another influential hard-right coalition member, also owes favors to Washington. In June, this relationship helped him score the biggest IMF loan in history, $50 billion dollars\u2014subsequently upped to $56.3 billion when the economy did much worse than the IMF had forecast under the agreement. The United States blocked loans to the government of his predecessor and rival from multilateral lending institutions such as the Inter-American Development Bank. Since Argentina was running into balance of payments problems toward the end of President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s term, this was significant. An even bigger blow to her government came from an apparently politically motivated New York judge, who took more than 90 percent of Argentina\u2019s creditors hostage in 2012 by ruling that they could not be paid until certain U.S.-based vulture funds were paid first. All of these problems with the U.S. were quickly resolved soon after Macri took office in 2015.\n\nThe media sometimes singles out President Len\u00edn Moreno of Ecuador to show that there is a \u201ccenter-left\u201d presence in this illegal and somewhat barbaric enterprise. Moreno was indeed elected in 2017 with the support of former president Rafael Corea\u2019s leftist Alianza PAIS party. But he quickly took a sharp turn away from his mandate, forming an alliance with right-wing oligarchs and using extra-constitutional means to consolidate power. He is now trying to put the former president in jail on what look like trumped-up charges. Moreno has been rewarded by Washington with $10 billion in loans from multilateral institutions, including $4.2 billion just scored from the IMF last week. If $10 billion doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, consider that the loan, expressed as a percentage of the Ecuador\u2019s economy, would be equivalent to the U.S. receiving $1.9 trillion. No surprise that Len\u00edn Moreno has joined the Trump Coalition.\n\nThe president of Paraguay also has cause to thank the United States godfather. His party, the Colorado Party, ruled the country for 61 consecutive years, the majority of it under the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner. In 2008, a leftist bishop named Fernando Lugo won the presidency against heavy odds. However, he was toppled in a parliamentary coup in 2012, which was opposed by almost all of South America; once again, Washington worked with the OAS to help legitimize the coup. So, there\u2019s another South American president happy to join the U.S.-led push for a right-wing leader in Venezuela. Yet one more is President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era of Chile, a Pinochet sympathizer who appointed two former allies of the U.S.-backed dictator to his cabinet last year.\n\nThis is how we do it\u2014today, at least. A few years ago\u2014when most of the region was governed by left-of-center governments, Trump wouldn\u2019t have gotten a single government in the region to support an illegal regime change operation. Obama\u2019s secretary of state John Kerry discovered this in 2013 when violent opposition demonstrators were in the streets in Venezuela, trying to overturn Maduro\u2019s first election. There was absolutely no doubt about the election results, and almost every government in the world recognized them. Kerry soon found himself completely isolated; Washington gave in and accepted Maduro\u2019s election.\n\nThen there is Europe, which for a number of historical reasons has only occasionally pursued a foreign policy independent of the United States. This is especially true for Latin America, where the Monroe Doctrine, shamelessly invoked in public by National Security Advisor John Bolton a few days ago, is generally respected. That said, some arm twisting was necessary to flip Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez of Spain, who had rather insubordinately opposed the Trump sanctions against Venezuela even prior to the trade embargo and recognition of Guaid\u00f3 in January. His foreign minister, Josep Borell, told the press that the administration had received \u201cpressure\u201d from Washington. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s PSOE socialist-led government was also under intense pressure from the big Spanish media, which has been in full regime-change mode for some time; they face elections at the end of April. Spain was particularly important in securing European support for this venture, since other countries, including Germany, often take Spain\u2019s view seriously on policy in Latin America.\n\nEven if the Trump team had a global majority\u2014which it doesn\u2019t, with only 50 out of 195 countries worldwide backing Venezuelan regime change\u2014their deadly economic sanctions, theft of assets, military threats, and other actions to topple Venezuela\u2019s government would be no more legal or legitimate than George W. Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq, or the many U.S.-led regime change efforts that have taken place in this hemisphere. That\u2019s unsurprising, given who\u2019s at the wheel: perennial regime-change advocate John Bolton, for example, or special envoy Elliott Abrams, who supported what the UN later found to be genocide in Guatemala, as well as the US-sponsored atrocities in El Salvador and Nicaragua in the 1980s. The cast of characters supporting this regime-change effort, whether in Washington or among some of its closest allies, should underline what is already obvious: The United States\u2019 attempt to oust Maduro has nothing to do with democracy or human rights."

    "text": "Declaring March Irish Heritage Month, President Trump paid tribute to \u201cthe tremendous role Irish immigrants and their descendants have played in the development of our great nation.\u201d It was a perfunctory proclamation, issued every March since 1990 by presidents Democratic and Republican. But given the professed nativism of the president praising this once reviled immigrant group, it\u2019s worth looking a little more closely at the Irish in America. They have indeed played a tremendous role, just not the one Trump or many Irish Americans might choose to remember.\n\nAs St. Patrick\u2019s Day approaches Irish Americans are once again pulling out our Donegal tweed flat caps and preparing to sing our wistful songs. The Irish in America are tenacious in their cultural identification, claiming an Irish identity a century or more after our forbearers stepped off the boat. We keep our poetry and our grudges, but in the long years of assimilation we seem to have shed what was once a hallmark of Irish identity: a solidarity with the oppressed.\n\nIrish names are prominent among Trump loyalists. Many Irish Americans have adopted his brand of nativism, as well as an every-man-for-himself faith in the market and a tight-heartedness that would have been anathema to our grandparents. Half of us voted for Trump in 2016. But Irish American history is filled with characters who looked outward from their Irishness, who stood, sometimes fiercely, for the outsider and the exploited, who could see their plight in the struggles of other peoples.\n\nThe Sons of Molly Maguire, a clandestine organization of Irish and Irish American labor radicals in coal country Pennsylvania in the 1870s, took their inspiration\u2014and possibly some members\u2014from a group of the same name in Ireland that set fires, killed livestock, and assassinated the gentry who had starved them off their land when the potato crop failed. There needn\u2019t have been a famine: Food was exported to England all across those hungry years. Likewise, there was no lack of income in America\u2019s coal country. The Molly Maguires directed their rage at the mine owners growing fat off their bent backs and blackening lungs. Their actions helped pave the way for unions and collective bargaining. Better to sit across a table and negotiate than forever be checking for dynamite."

    "text": "America likes immigrant stories. Chaplin\u2019s The Immigrant (1916), The Godfather Part II (1974), Moscow on the Hudson (1984), Coming to America (1988), A Better Life (2011)\u2014we see that moment, when anyone from anywhere else lands here, as the best day of the rest of their life. It\u2019s where the American dream begins, no matter how it turns out. We don\u2019t make too many movies about people who can\u2019t wait to leave, whose first day somewhere else is the best day of the rest of their life. But that\u2019s what The Quiet Man is.\n\nFord began shooting June 6, 1951, in rural Cong, Ireland. In Searching For John Ford, Joseph McBride writes, \u201cHis personal and professional allegiances thrown into turmoil by the cold war, he had lived for the past four years under the shadow of ideological fratricide. Like John Wayne\u2019s Sean Thornton, who leaves America in revulsion after killing a man in the ring, Ford was in flight from violence, material success, and the unexpected consequences of the American Dream.\u201d\n\nFord changed the name of Walsh\u2019s small town to fictional Inisfree, a literary allusion to W.B. Yeats\u2019s poem \u201cThe Lake Isle of Innisfree,\u201d about a utopian Irish Shangri-La\u2014an ironic hint as to what we\u2019ll find there. In John Ford: The Man and His Films, Tag Gallagher writes, \u201cFord moves rapidly through an analysis of Inisfree society. We go from train station to countryside to town to church to pub, meeting trainmen, coachmen, priests, aristocrats, squires, the IRA, drinkers, field hands, Anglican clergy,\u201d and then adds that the region \"is a Third-world culture.\u201d\n\nInisfree is indeed Third World, and Old World in its depiction of women. There is no electricity. It\u2019s a rural, barely 20th century town. In America, Ford himself liked living such a life, getting away to Monument Valley, Arizona, where he shot many of his westerns. There, he lived in the desert and immersed himself in Native American culture, becoming an honorary member of the Navajo. His yacht, the Araner, provided similar escapes, allowing him to journey down the coast of Mexico, to Hawaii, or simply out at sea, away from troubles. Or sometimes, he\u2019d just drink himself into oblivion until he could deal again.\n\nWe never see the U.S. in The Quiet Man, except for a single boxing flashback. But we learn that as boy in Pittsburgh, Sean was \u201cliving in a shack near the slag heaps.\u201d He recalls the steel mills and their \u201cpig iron furnaces so hot it makes a man forget his fear of hell,\u201d and his late mother\u2019s intense Irish nostalgia. His father died young. \u201cInisfree has become another word for heaven to me,\u201d he tells the Widow Tillane (Margaret Natwick). Later, in flashback, we see the night his success as a boxer put blood on his hands when he accidentally killed an opponent in a rage.\n\nThat\u2019s all we know of Sean\u2019s American life\u2014slag heaps, shacks, hellish heat, homesickness, blood money. For him, Ireland and America are literally heaven and hell. No one makes an anti-American speech. No one has to, Sean wants to be Irish. He wants an un-American life. It\u2019s a subtle sort of screenwriting, this \u201csmuggling,\u201d one that marks Ford\u2019s great films. This \u201csmuggling\u201d is exactly what the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals hoped to warn the nation about. In Ayn Rand\u2019s pamphlet for them, she wrote:\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the Communists in Hollywood is not the production of political movies openly advocating Communism. Their purpose is to corrupt our moral premises by corrupting non-political movies\u2014by introducing small, casual bits of propaganda into innocent stories\u2014thus making people absorb the basic principles of Collectivism by indirection and implication.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s not much Collectivist talk in The Quiet Man, but it\u2019s safe to say that Ward Bond, John Wayne, and John Ford do a pretty bad job of preserving American ideals.\n\nOne of the consistent complaints about The Quiet Man is its use of Irish stereotypes. The Nation's Manny Farber wrote of its \u201ctippling village cabby, the thick-headed, bellicose squire, and the jovial village priest who curses, jokes, and fishes from start to finish of the film.\u201d True, but in that it\u2019s Ford, a master ironist, there\u2019s a little more to them. That \u201ctippling village cabby,\u201d the impish Micheleen Oge Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald), is a village IRA militant. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a nice soft night,\u201d he sighs during an exit, \u201cI think I\u2019ll go join my comrades and talk a little treason.\u201d The locals quickly disabuse Sean of the magical Ireland he imagines. \u201cInisfree is far from being heaven,\u201d scoffs the Widow Tillane, who finds his sentimentality absurd. She sells him back his family cottage, which instantly makes him an enemy of the \u201cbellicose\u201d Squire Danaher (Victor McGlaglen), who also wants the land. Then Sean falls in love with Danaher\u2019s sister Mary Kate (O\u2019Hara) and he needs the squire\u2019s permission to marry and \u2026 well, it\u2019s complicated. Much more complicated, in fact, than Sean ever thought his dream would be, and soon his life is as bedeviled by money and fighting as it was in the U.S. The mistake is in assuming that low comedy indicates low ambition on Ford's part, any more than it does in Chaplin or Keaton.\n\nAt no point do the locals see Sean as one of them, no matter how Irish he fancies himself. He\u2019s \u201cthe Yank,\u201d \u201cthe American,\u201d a wannabe. When Sean gives his house a new coat of paint, a local lady points out, \u201cOnly an American would have thought of emerald green.\u201d Sean\u2019s idyllic love-at-first-sight courtship with Mary Kate Danaher (harps actually play on O'Hara's entrance) turns into a complicated Gaelic ritual about dowry. It\u2019s the money due her at her wedding, worth as much as his farm as estimated by some. In her mind, it means she comes to the marriage an economic equal, not a dependent. As she tells Sean on their wedding night, when she refuses to sleep with him, \u201cUntil I\u2019ve got my dowry safe about me, I\u2019m no married woman. I\u2019m the servant I have always been, without anything of my own.\u201d\n\nSean is the one who dreams of an Inisfree, not Ford, who knew Ireland. He knew it from his parents\u2019 memories, studying history, and his visits beginning in 1921, when he brought money for his relatives in the IRA. He filmed Mother Machree (1928), The Informer (1935), The Plough and The Stars (1936). He populated his 19th century westerns with Irish-Americans, as privates and sergeants advancing from the bottom up. The Last Hurrah (1955) is about a 20th century Irish-American big city mayor, of Ford\u2019s age, risen to the top yet full of scars and bitterness from a lifetime of discrimination, slights, and slurs. So why the lightweight comic types of The Quiet Man? Ford was making a movie about a man who finds American life lacking. Their charm sugarcoats it. He made them silly, broad, cartoonish at times, yet increasingly nuanced as the story develops, as Sean Thornton comes to see them as they are and becomes one of them.\n\nSean has to learn to live by rural Irish custom, and he does. In the end, his pacifism caves and he fights the Squire, a baptism by donnybrook. There\u2019s no talk of taking Mary Kate back to the promised land of Pittsburgh. He\u2019s doing all this because he knows he\u2019s never going back. For all the people and movies Wayne called \u201cun-American,\u201d he never questioned this \u201cphony art house film.\u201d Ford most likely never discussed any of this with him. He was famously evasive about why he made his movies. \u201cIt\u2019s no use asking me to talk about art,\u201d he told journalist Lindsay Anderson while he visited the set. Ford denied even liking movies, telling him: \u201cChrist, I hate pictures.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve worked with the best of them,\u201d Wayne once said. \u201cJohn Ford isn\u2019t exactly a bum, is he? Yet he never gave me any manure about art. He just made movies and that's what I do.\u201d\n\nThe Quiet Man wrapped, and the cast and crew returned home. Ford took a more hands-on approach in post-production than he usually did, fending off Herbert Yates\u2019s ideas on title changes, editing, and cost cutting. It was slated for a September 1952 release. By October, Ford had left the country again, shooting Mogambo (1953) with Clark Gable and Ava Gardner in Africa.\n\nBack home, John Wayne returned to his second career, rooting out subversives wherever he imagined them, like the July 1952 Republican National Convention. A supporter of far-right Senator Robert Taft of Ohio, Wayne was seen on the street shouting down an Eisenhower supporter with, \"Why don't you get a red flag?\" Later that month, Gary Cooper\u2019s western High Noon, written by blacklisted writer Carl Foreman and directed by Fred \u201cTzinnemann,\u201d was released. Hedda Hopper, pundit Westbrook Pegler, and Wayne denounced Foreman, who had moved to Europe. \u201cI'll never regret having helped run Foreman out of this country!\u201d Wayne said years later. Wayne regarded High Noon as \u201cthe most un-American thing I ever saw in my whole life.\u201d In it, Cooper plays a sheriff turned down for help by a whole town when gunmen come to kill him. After Cooper kills off the gang, he tosses his badge in the dirt and quits. Wayne hated that ending, where an embittered tough guy turns his back on his community for good. Then again, you might say High Noon ends where The Quiet Man begins.\n\nIn August, The Quiet Man got a Los Angeles and New York release before going national in mid-September. Few critics took the movie seriously, not that Ford gave them any straight answers or manure about art. When The New York Times talked to him, he said his real name was \u201cSean Aloysius Feeney,\u201d and the paper reported that he \u201cadmits that he has assiduously studied the Irish for forty years, that he doesn't know a thing about them and that he has \u2018never met an Irishman\u2019 with whom he could agree. All of which apparently doesn't make a bit of sense at all.\u201d Rather than pursue it, the Times review simply raved about all the \u201cfine bhoyos and colleens, a rollicking tale and the green, dewy countryside to come up with as darlin' a picture as we've seen this year.\u201d\n\nFord\u2019s high brow literary allusions and ironies simply went over their heads. \u201cIf am to believe what I saw in John Ford\u2019s sentimental new film, The Quiet Man, practically everyone in Ireland is cute as a button,\u201d Philip Hamburger wrote in The New Yorker. \u201cThe master who made The Informer appears to have fallen into a vat of treacle.\u201d Farber saw \u201call the trusted hokums that are supposed to make the Irish so humorous-sympathetic.\u2026 But all of this padding of what is supposed to be an illusive, impressionistic study of a land and its people is disturbing because it becomes the underlying motive for the scenes, revealing the limited significance of every pub brawl, horse race, or pastoral event almost before the scene is underway.\u201d\n\nWell, yes, if a study of Ireland is the point, instead of a study of an unhappy American. When seen as a movie about Sean\u2019s naturalization, these comic set pieces only grow in weight. Given the acid political climate, perhaps Ford was OK with the film not being written up as a movie about a man who can\u2019t stand living in America. \u201cIndeed, the film\u2019s commercialism and intoxicating Technicolor tend to obscure its documentary and Brechtian aspects,\u201d Tag Gallagher wrote.\n\nThat September, the American public embraced Sean\u2019s farewell to the U.S. For all the bitterness over what Americanism meant, the 1950s were also a period of Civil Rights advancement, free speech expansion, higher education. Quite a few people were redefining what America meant to them, and it had nothing to do with communism. As Ford prepped The Quiet Man in spring 1951, Jack Kerouac finished his manuscript for On The Road. After his 1950 return from Paris, Miles Davis recorded Blue Period (1951).\n\nThe Quiet Man emerged as a top box-office earner and garnered five Oscar nominations. Accounts of The Quiet Man hasten to point out that Sean was never a U.S. citizen in the first place, or mistake him as an IRA exile. They give his bitterness about American life a pass, as if he was never really one of us. That\u2019s not how everyone saw such people. Their loyalties as \u201caliens\u201d were heavily scrutinized, something Ford understood and saw happening as his movie opened that month.\n\nIn September 1952, Chaplin sailed on the Queen Elizabeth to premiere Limelight (1952) in London. Mid-voyage, Chaplin learned that the Truman Administration had revoked his visa. \u201cI say, \u2018good riddance to bad company,'\u201d crowed Hedda Hopper. Then, on April 15, 1953, Chaplin made a decision that stoked outrage. He announced that he did not want to come back. Like Sean, his prize-fighting career behind him, Chaplin found a small idyllic European village to live in, Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland. Even those sympathetic to Chaplin, like Hopper\u2019s gossip-columnist rival, Louella Parsons, chided his \u201carrogance and indifference to his adopted country.\u201d \u201cThe very fact that Chaplin refrained from claiming the benefits of American citizenship suggests the viewpoint of an internationalist who scorns loyalty to any country as bourgeoisie or middleclass,\u201d editorialized the Reading Eagle. Yes, \u201cthe very fact.\u201d Unlike Chaplin, however, who made his critiques of the U.S. well known, Ford hid his away after World War II. Evasive in interviews, colluding with the far right MPA, he rarely allowed moments like his Screen Directors Guild speech, saving it all for his films.\n\nThe Quiet Man won Ford a fourth Oscar for directing, and Winton C. Hoch a second for cinematography. At the March 25, 1953 ceremony in Los Angeles, John Wayne accepted Ford\u2019s Oscar because the director was still out of the country. Wayne repeated the favor for Gary Cooper, also absent, who won Best Actor for his performance in High Noon. As much as Wayne despised High Noon, and worked to blacklist its writer, an Oscar moment was an Oscar moment and his career always came first, so he strode up to accept Cooper\u2019s Oscar for his landmark work of apparently un-American acting. Wayne even joked, \"I'm going to go back and find my business manager, and agent, producer, and three-name writer and find out why I didn\u2019t get High Noon instead of Cooper.\u201d\n\nWell, maybe they figured Wayne had already made his un-American movie for that year. At a time of loyalty oaths, blacklists, and outright hate, John Ford finally managed to make his \u201cphony art house picture\u201d about escaping the American Dream. Instead of fodder for pundits, cranks, and FBI files, it became a holiday staple, everybody\u2019s favorite St. Patrick\u2019s Day rom-com."

    "text": "On the fifth anniversary of Michael Jackson\u2019s death, a quote from Nas appeared in a Rolling Stone piece by the writer Tour\u00e9: \u201cWhen I got the news, the weather around me immediately changed drastically,\u201d the rapper said. \u201cIt suddenly rained so hard. Wind blew like crazy. Clouds did something different. It was as if you felt him leaving the world.\u201d Nas spoke about Jackson as if he were a god. (The article is headlined \u201cMichael Jackson: Black Superhero.\u201d) Quoting an array of African American luminaries on Jackson\u2019s legacy, Tour\u00e9 explained just how much he meant to black people, and how rapidly his \u201cWacko Jacko\u201d label was fading away after his death. Free of the mockery he experienced in his lifetime, Jackson was finally taking his rightful place in the canon of American icons.\n\nNowhere in Tour\u00e9\u2019s article is there mention of the multiple accusations of child abuse that were levied against Jackson\u2014accusations that have gained new life with the release of HBO\u2019s documentary Leaving Neverland, which chronicles, in excruciating and credible detail, Jackson\u2019s abuse of two boys, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who have now come forward as adults. Tour\u00e9\u2019s omission is especially notable when you consider that he is a principal talking head in the other recent documentary about a serial abuser who was hiding in plain sight: Surviving R. Kelly, which chronicles, in excruciating and credible detail, the R&B star\u2019s alleged abuse of numerous women and underage girls. That Tour\u00e9, who unlike so many others wasn\u2019t fooled by R. Kelly, got caught up in Jackson hagiography suggests that there is something fundamentally different about his case\u2014that he is too important to too many people to give up easily; that there is something about Jackson that makes us all a little confused.\n\nAs the evidence presented in Leaving Neverland reverberates through the media, the reaction has been oddly muted. In The New York Times, Wesley Morris wrote a moving account of seeing through Jackson\u2019s \u201cmagic trick\u201d at last. Slate published a series of articles reckoning with his life and legacy, with Carl Wilson writing, \u201cThere are plenty of Jackson songs that will feel radioactive from now on.\u201d Jackson has a few prominent defenders, like Wendy Williams, and legions of civilian fans who point out that a documentary is not the same thing as a conviction. Still, the atmosphere has not been filled up with the kind of debate or commentary that accompanied the controversies surrounding R. Kelly, Harvey Weinstein, or Woody Allen. The predominant sense is of baffled silence, as if the magnitude of Jackson\u2019s crimes is so great that it hushes all else. What, really, is there to say? The boys were so young, and they loved him so much.\n\nBut there is perhaps another reason the chattering class has been so uncharacteristically quiet: Michael Jackson presents a case too extraordinary for the media to easily absorb and process. Jackson was not just a pop star: he was the pop star, the King of Pop, the most famous famous person. To try to cancel him would be to point out a criminal at the very heart of the entertainment industry\u2019s belief system, and to remove the laurels of the most significant black artist of the pop age. To analyze the phenomenon of Michael Jackson properly would mean taking on the laborious task of figuring out how we\u2014meaning society at large\u2014ended up with the kind of entertainment industry we have. And it would mean admitting that the American dream\u2014a rapid ascent to stardom on the basis of sheer talent\u2014is hollow."

    "text": "The Royal Canadian Mounted Police submitted these charges in 2015, before Trudeau entered office. A successful criminal prosecution would bar SNC-Lavalin from bidding on any federal government contracts for 10 years. But the Globe and Mail broke the news in early February that Trudeau\u2019s office had asked Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould to abandon the criminal charges. Wilson-Raybould, who also sat in Trudeau\u2019s cabinet as justice minister, later confirmed a \u201cbarrage\u201d of pressure from senior officials, including Trudeau himself, who asked her to \u201chelp out\u201d with the case and \u201cfind a solution.\u201d She rebuffed their campaign, was demoted, then resigned.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s team sought a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), which would impose a financial penalty and some greater oversight of SNC-Lavalin, but no criminal sanctions, enabling it to continue to bid on government contracts. Prosecutors in Canada didn\u2019t have the option of deferring criminal prosecution until a change in the law last year, one that SNC-Lavalin lobbied for.\n\nWhile deferred prosecution agreements are new to Canada, they\u2019ve been used in corporate settlements in the U.S. for more than two decades, particularly during and after the last financial crisis, when hundreds of DPAs were executed. In other words, the major difference between the scandal engulfing Canada\u2019s government and what happens routinely here is that nobody in our Justice Department needs to be pressured to issue a deferred prosecution agreement.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s most notorious DPA of the past decade was in 2012 with HSBC, the bank that facilitated money laundering for drug cartels and terrorist groups. Drug lords even designed specially shaped boxes filled with money that slid easily through HSBC Mexico\u2019s teller windows. Neither HSBC nor its executives were criminally prosecuted, and the bank was merely fined $1.9 billion\u2014around five weeks\u2019 profit.\n\nJustice Department officials had cautioned that criminal charges would destroy HSBC and put thousands of innocent bank tellers out of work. Eric Holder, Obama\u2019s attorney general at the time, expressed concern that banks like HSBC have become so sprawling that \u201cit does become difficult for us to prosecute.\u201d The phrase \u201cToo Big to Jail\u201d was coined out of the HSBC mess. But Holder had been warning of \u201ccollateral consequences\u201d for prosecuting corporations since a memo he wrote while deputy attorney general in 1999."

    ],
    "text": "As the scholars note, Kahlo took part in the shaping of her own legend; she liked to say that she was born in Coyoac\u00e1n in 1910, not 1907, so that her birthday would sync up with the Mexican Revolution. She sometimes played to the assumption that her father, the photographer Guillermo Kahlo, who immigrated to Mexico from Germany, was Jewish, though he came from a Lutheran family. Her story of Indigenous and Jewish ancestry helped create a stronger undergirding for her Communist political commitments and vehement anti-Nazi stance in the 1930s, so Kahlo often went along with it, and propagated the lore of herself.\n\nYet depictions of Kahlo have strayed further from the reality than she could have imagined. A major studio biopic starring Salma Hayek portrayed her (to Hayek\u2019s dismay) as a tango-dancing flirt, who lusted for the photographer Tina Modotti. She made a cameo in Disney-Pixar\u2019s Coco as a dotty performance artist who worked with oversize fruits. Mattel created a Frida Kahlo Barbie doll (a stunt that caused discord among some of her relatives). Kahlo\u2019s niece launched a Frida Kahlo tequila, which many critics and curators deemed disrespectful, since Kahlo drank tequila to soothe the excruciating pains in her body: A childhood case of polio left her with a permanently injured leg, and, after a bus accident when she was 18, she struggled with torso pain for the rest of her life.\n\nKahlo\u2019s face, with its trademark unibrow (usually exaggerated to the point of caricature), has taken on a symbolism of its own. Appearing on jacket pins and backpack patches, it serves as a visual shorthand, variously, for \u201cbadass\u201d feminist artistic practice, for Latinx artists writ large, for the cultivation of ambition against the odds. At least since the early 1980s, when the art critic Hayden Herrera published her popular biography Frida, Kahlo has been an empowerment icon; a challenge to white, male hegemony; a woman artist who was heroic but glamorous, connected to her body but also able to float above it and see herself with arrows shot through her chest. Yet Kahlo\u2019s obsession with painting her own image wasn\u2019t to cast herself as a hero; it was an exploratory process, an experiment in fusing a life into art. The shelves and shelves of merchandise seem to fulfill a prophecy she never spoke.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Brooklyn Museum show tells a different story. The first thing you see on entering is a large screen, playing rare color footage of Kahlo circa 1941 at La Casa Azul, the family home where she spent much of her life. She is wearing a traditional Tehuana outfit: a boxy blouse embroidered with flowers, a scarlet broom skirt, substantial gold earrings. She is grinning, her hands clasped beatifically in front of her, and every now and then, she looks sardonically out of the corner of her eye. She seems young, and neither frail nor provocative. She is not dancing the tango. She\u2019s just puttering about, sitting softly on the cement floor.\n\nKahlo was a person, after all, not just a transcendent image. She hoped to be remembered, as many artists do, but she ca\u2044red most about being noticed and recognized by those closest to her. Most of the striking photographs of Kahlo in the exhibition were taken by her confidants and lovers. Appearances Can Be Deceiving charts out Kahlo\u2019s life through these intense relationships, beginning with her devotion to her father, who took several striking gelatin portraits of her as a teenager, both before and after her accident. It then moves into Kahlo\u2019s twenties and thirties, when she met not only the artist Diego Rivera (fully twice her age), but also a group of leftist friends and fellow artists (including Leon Trotsky and his wife, and the photographer Nickolas Muray) who supported her ambitions and filled her days with correspondence, inside jokes, and opportunities to play dress-up in front of a camera."

    "text": "Those repudiating Cox included members of the anti-EU European Research Group, chaired by Jacob Rees-Mogg, a millionaire hedge-funder who once canvassed for votes with his nanny. The ERG, which wants Brexit at almost any cost, has opposed May\u2019s arguably necessary deal-making concessions at every turn. When Brexit supposedly kicks in, on March 29, they figure, the country will have no deal, and thus \u201ccrash out\u201d of the European Union, going from a massive customs union into relative isolation, with all the economic disruption that entails. The ERG, along with a surprisingly large number of other Brexiteers, now believe that\u2019s worth the risk, in order to avoid leaving any loopholes through which undesirable goods, services, or people could pass from Europe to the U.K.\n\nThese hardliners\u2019 intransigence may prove their undoing. On Wednesday, a motion to take a no-deal Brexit off the table passed narrowly. (This doesn\u2019t change the fact that a no-deal Brexit is still, legally, the default if the U.K. cannot come up with a plan.) Today May opens a vote on whether to ask the EU\u2019s permission to delay Britain\u2019s withdrawal. Within a week, she will attempt a third time to get her deal through Parliament, with an ultimatum that, should it fail, the exit date may be extended, and Brexit could even be quashed altogether. This should get May\u2019s third deal vote passed, though any deal must ultimately be negotiated by the EU\u2019s remaining 27 member states, and a head-spinning number of possible outcomes remain.\n\nRegular Brits, meanwhile, have almost disappeared from the Brexit conversation. From workers set to lose jobs, to those on the much-debated Irish border and hundreds of thousands of expats across continental Europe whose visa fates are uncertain, the lives of millions have been reduced to percentage points on GDP, cannon fodder in the illusory crusade for sovereignty.\n\nBritain, a nation of 66 million people, is paralyzed beneath a political impasse that is increasingly confined to Westminster.\n\nMany of the politicians who claimed to speak for the \u201cperson on the Clapham omnibus,\u201d a popular British phrase for an everyman, have long retreated from Brexit\u2019s frontline. Nigel Farage, who triumphantly declared in 2016 that the referendum was Britain\u2019s \u201cIndependence Day,\u201d has scaled back his day-to-day political activities and now makes a killing on Fox News and other media channels. If the people ever had a voice, it, like Theresa May\u2019s on Tuesday, has vanished to a barely audible croak.\n\nEntire magazines, podcasts and TV shows exist to service Brexit\u2019s Sisyphean bureaucracy. It sucks the air out of any other story. Last week the debate on a sharp rise in knife crime across the U.K., on the BBC\u2019s flagship political show Question Time, lasted just a few minutes between slanging matches over Brexit. Rarely does any political platform last more than five minutes before somebody mentions the B-word. Britain, a nation of 66 million people, is paralyzed beneath a political impasse that is increasingly confined to Westminster. So much for a popular referendum."

    "title": "The Universe According to Hilma af Klint",
    "authors": [
      "Jillian Steinhauer"
    ],
    "text": "When she did begin again, she worked differently, now driven by a voice within and asserting more agency over her compositions, as Steiner had urged her to. Still, she continued to make partially or wholly abstract series whose shapes seem to contain the secrets of the world. A gorgeous trio of altarpieces from 1915 radiates cosmic, religious energy from its golden circles and divided triangles. Perhaps because of Steiner, however, she knew the world wasn\u2019t ready to receive them. In 1932, in one of the many notebooks she used to meticulously catalogue her art, af Klint wrote that all the works annotated with certain symbols should not be opened until 20 years after her death.\n\nIt took a lot longer than that. Hilma af Klint died in 1944, at the age of 81. Her abstract work wasn\u2019t shown publicly until 1986, when the Los Angeles County Museum of Art included some of her paintings in the exhibition The Spiritual in Art. As Daniel Birnbaum, the director of Stockholm\u2019s Moderna Museet, recounts in the Guggenheim catalogue, \u201cthe reaction to that very first exhibition was one of enthusiasm but also of confusion and skepticism.\u201d The critic Hilton Kramer was especially dismissive, writing of af Klint\u2019s paintings, \u201cTo accord them a place of honor alongside the work of Kandinsky, Mondrian, Malevich, and Kupka \u2026 is absurd. Af Klint is simply not an artist in their class, and\u2014dare I say it?\u2014would never have been given this inflated treatment if she had not been a woman.\u201d\n\nAf Klint is dismissed as a \u201cmystic\u201d because to accept her as an artist would mean having to revise the definition of who gets to be one.\n\nThe reaction this time around has been better. Most critics have acknowledged and celebrated af Klint\u2019s vision, even if they don\u2019t quite know what to make of it. But I can\u2019t help thinking we\u2019re still not quite ready for her\u2014a woman who defied some of the crucial binaries that our culture stubbornly upholds. Af Klint was a trained artist who was also self-taught; she was insider as well as an outsider. She studied science and spiritualism. She made art as well as illustration. And in her art\u2014often in the same series\u2014she used figuration and abstraction, prizing neither one as a culminating achievement but rather drawing on both as they suited her needs.\n\nMuch of the debate and discussion around af Klint, at least in art circles, has centered on the question of whether she \u201cgot there first\u201d\u2014whether she made abstract paintings before the men. It seems obvious that she did, just not in a way we\u2019ve been told counts as legitimate. A critical establishment that prizes rationalism and male ego is ill equipped to recognize the achievements of a woman who sought a higher purpose beyond herself. Never mind that Kandinsky also conceived of art as a means of spiritual expression. Or that Mondrian was also an adherent of Theosophy. Af Klint is dismissed as a \u201cmystic\u201d (according to one anecdote in the catalogue), because to accept her as an artist would mean having to revise the definition of who gets to be one.\n\nIt would take careful study of the more than 2,600 pages of writing she left behind\u2014lexicons explaining the meanings of the letters in her paintings, notebooks cataloguing her work, book manuscripts\u2014to begin to grasp what af Klint was trying to tell us, her future viewers. But you don\u2019t need that esoteric knowledge to stand before her paintings and feel their challenge: to put aside what you\u2019ve been taught and open yourself up to an unfamiliar and more expansive way of seeing the world."

    "text": "There is no practical purpose in giving a 50-year sentence to a 69-year-old defendant like Manafort. And according to the research, the prospect of a 50-year sentence probably wouldn\u2019t have even deterred Manafort if he thought he wouldn\u2019t get caught. What is remarkable about Manafort\u2019s conduct was how serious and repeated his tax and foreign conspiracy violations were. As the sentencing judge put it, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I got caught,\u201d is \u201cnot an inspiring plea for leniency.\u201d And that, indeed, is the bigger moral of Paul Manafort\u2019s long criminal career: for many years, he was not caught.\n\n\n\nWhy? It\u2019s not, as we now know in exhaustive detail, that Manafort was any sort of cunning criminal mastermind. No, he was able, like countless other offenders in the sphere of financial and corporate crime, to exploit enormous loopholes in a porous, under-resourced regime of regulatory capture and indifferent enforcement.\n\nFor many years, the justice system has allowed serious corporate corruption to go unpunished, banks to be prosecuted repeatedly for the same crimes, and corporations and executives to get deferred prosecutions and below-the-guideline sentencing. This system of pronounced judicial leniency has created a punishment model for many corporate offenders that I call \u201ctoo big to jail\u201d\u2014and in recent years, matters have gotten worse. Even within this already skewed and top-heavy system, I have documented declining corporate penalties under the Trump administration. Ending \u201ctoo big to jail,\u201d however, doesn\u2019t mean passing tougher sentences for white-collar crimes. After all, Congress has created plenty of tough new white-collar offenses since the 2001 Enron scandal\u2014and, for the most part, these new tools have sat on the shelf untouched by prosecutors.\n\nInstead of enacting more draconian sentences, we must invest in white-collar law enforcement the same way we invest in other measures to protect public safety. Consider this: the Internal Revenue Service has had its budget cut over the past decade to the point where audits have decreased by 42 percent and the number of tax fraud cases the agency brings has been cut by nearly 25 percent. Under such lax enforcement, tax fraud schemes\u2014of the very sort repeatedly carried out by Paul Manafort\u2014are able to thrive. And while better white-collar crime enforcement is a key, neglected foundation of public safety, the rationale for more sustained and concerted pursuit of white-collar criminals doesn\u2019t end there. These offenses also pose much broader hazards to our well-being. They endanger the national economy\u2014and conspiring with other countries endangers national security\u2014on a far greater scale than the harms wrought by drug possession and street crimes.\n\nThe way out of the double standard we apply to punishment is to reject the notion that true justice inheres in strictly hewing to a one-size-fits-all model of criminal sentencing. To begin using law enforcement as a means of meaningful social reform, we need, rather, to consistently apply the same standards of enforcement to all types of crime: police far more, prosecute and punish far less, utilize evidence-based treatment, and ask that violators give back and make the community whole. Harsh sentences don\u2019t deter crime, but changing the focus of our enforcement systems just might.\n\n"

    "text": "It\u2019s no surprise, then, that many American leftists conceive of the ideal foreign policy of a future progressive administration\u2014that of President Sanders or, one day, Ocasio-Cortez\u2014in essentially negative terms. Despairing of the United States ever sincerely and effectively advancing a program of international progress, they instead hope the country will simply refrain from current conduct (arming and underwriting Saudi Arabia\u2019s genocidal war in Yemen, Israel\u2019s apartheid-style administration of its Palestinian subjects, General el-Sisi\u2019s imprisonment and execution of dissidents in Egypt, etc.). Aziz Rana has advocated a foreign policy along the lines of the Hippocratic oath: \u201cDo no harm\u201d would be \u201ca key principle\u201d of such a \u201cnon-imperial approach.\u201d More specifically, progressive writers have praised Bernie Sanders\u2019s foreign policy in light of his successful sponsorship of a resolution in the Senate to end assistance to the Saudi war in Yemen\u2014a genuine but fundamentally negative triumph, promoting a decent abstention from a foreign adventure over indecent participation in it.\n\nThe bloody record of U.S. activity abroad amply justifies the preference among leftists for what might be called an abstinence-only foreign policy (with, perhaps, about as little realism to the program as abstinence-only sex ed). It ought to go without saying that no truly left foreign policy can emerge prior to the unforeseeable refoundation of the United States as a truly left polity\u2014one, that is, committed to overcoming rather than reinforcing world capitalism. As Highsmith\u2019s Edith says in another context, \u201cThe difference between dream and reality is the true hell.\u201d\n\nAnd yet . . . The ecological predicament of global\u2014capitalist\u2014civilization has become so dire and urgent that demanding the mere retreat of the United States from foreign entanglements is its own kind of irresponsibility. A domestic Green New Deal would need to be complemented by an international Green Marshall Plan (or whatever U.S. politicians choose to call it) promoting the greening of capitalist economies over the next dozen years or so, not only to keep global warming within tolerable bounds but to preserve capitalist civilization for its ultimate socialist or communist takeover. The adjective \u201cgreen\u201d is of course as susceptible to abusive and hypocritical invocation as any other high-sounding slogan, but some such\u2014still capitalist, merely reformist, finally inadequate\u2014U.S. foreign policy will likely be necessary in order for us to save the world, for its workers to win.\n\nThe ecological predicament has become so dire and urgent that demanding the mere retreat of the United States from foreign entanglements is its own kind of irresponsibility.\n\nWhat might a green internationalism consist of? The left economist Robert Pollin has argued that \u201ca worldwide program to invest between 1.5 and 2 percent of global GDP every year to raise energy-efficiency standards and expand clean renewable-energy supplies\u201d could sufficiently transform the capitalist world economy to stave off ruinous climate change. Another natural component of such a program would be the substitution of fossil-fueled vehicle fleets for trains, trucks, cars, and planes powered by renewable energy.\n\nThe United States could promote such a transformation of the energetic basis of the world economy through a combination of preferential trade agreements with countries committing themselves to such renovation, sanctions against those refusing to get with the program, and direct economic aid to countries in need of assistance to accomplish the necessary change. This task would presumably be at once most important and trickiest when it came to U.S. allies\u2014countries as distinct as Canada, Saudi Arabia, and Nigeria\u2014whose economies are especially dependent on hydrocarbons. If U.S. manufacturers of windmills, electric vehicles, and solar panels enrich themselves in the process\u2014locating many of their operations, perhaps, in Canada, Saudi Arabia, and Nigeria, etc.\u2014this seems an acceptable price to pay for the rescue of global civilization. Of course, if a nominally socialist U.S. president were to be so genuinely socialist as to sponsor worker-owned cooperatives to furnish the planet with wind farms, EVs, and solar arrays, so much the better."

    "text": "But the way to get people excited about a presidential candidacy is to be an exciting presidential candidate\u2014not to bait them about a potential run for months. America was tiring of his act: He began slipping in the presidential polls. Perhaps sensing he could drag this out no longer, he announced in late February that he had made a decision, and \u2026 well, he\u2019d reveal it at some point in the near future.\n\n\n\nThen he dragged it out for another two weeks.\n\n\n\nFinally, this week, O\u2019Rourke announced he was entering the race. Even this was a multi-day affair, culminating in a swing through Iowa where he gave his spoken-word pitch while standing on coffeeshop countertops. The rollout of his decision also included a fawning profile in Vanity Fair, complete with photographs from Annie Leibowitz. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know how much of it was me,\u201d he told Joe Hagan, sounding a bit like a band member in Almost Famous. \u201cBut there is something abnormal, super-normal, or I don\u2019t know what the hell to call it, that we both experience when we\u2019re out on the campaign trail.\u201d While other Democratic candidates have defined themselves by the policies they support, or their vision for the country, O\u2019Rourke spoke about the nomination as if it was his birthright. \u201cMan, I\u2019m just born to be in it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can probably tell that I want to run. I do. I think I\u2019d be good at it.\u201d He had less to say about whether he\u2019d be any good at running the country.\n\n\n\nTo be fair, some prominent people think he would be very good at it. People from Obama\u2019s orbit, in particular, have singled O\u2019Rourke out, giving credibility to the comparison. Though not a fan of his blogs, former Obama chief strategist David Axelrod has praised O\u2019Rourke repeatedly, noting his vision \u201ccomes from a belief that, through politics, we can achieve a higher purpose.\u201d Former Obama field organizer Lauren Pardi told NBC late last year that \u201cBeto has a special ability\u2014like President Obama did\u2014to make people believe in the best version of America.\u201d Obama himself made the comparison on Axelrod\u2019s podcast late last-year, noting that voters see a similar authenticity in the two. \u201cIt felt as if he based his statements and his positions on what he believed,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nBut the similarities largely end on that most ineffable political quality of authenticity. Obama launched his political campaign in 2007 by arguing that the bipartisan vote for the Iraq War was a historic mistake, that universal health care was a moral necessity, and that our economic system was dangerously inequitable. O\u2019Rourke lacks any platform whatsoever. He has no signature idea, and we know little about his political positions beyond the mushy centrism he exhibited in Congress. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s decision to spend the last five months blogging could be seen as an attempt to shore up another weakness: His lack of a particularly compelling biography. Spending one\u2019s twenties as an aimless musician, as O\u2019Rourke did, is hardly the stuff of Dreams of My Father.\n\n\n\nInstead, the biggest thing that O\u2019Rourke has in common with Obama, the 2008 candidate, is the belief that they can transcend a broken political system with lofty rhetoric about bringing people together. But when Obama spoke about healing divisions, millions of people believed him. And it still didn\u2019t work. Obama came to his senses while in office, as the Republican Party committed itself to bigotry and intransigence, and he now spends his political capital and energy on reforming our broken democracy. Many of the Democratic candidates for president have their own proposals for doing so. O\u2019Rourke just has a blog, and a big beautiful smile that some folks can\u2019t resist. It\u2019s as if the last ten years of American political life never happened."

    "text": "The conference held in Washington, D.C., last Saturday by the National Policy Institute should have dispelled any lingering illusions about the \u201calt-right.\u201d In the final speech of the night, Richard Spencer, the movement\u2019s de factor leader, referred to the press as \u201csoulless golem\u201d and, with a conspiratorial grin, recommended referring to them \u201cin the original German\u201d as the l\u00fcgenpresse (lying press), a phrase popularized by the Nazis in the 1920s and 1930s. In a further echo of the European far right, Spencer shouted out, \u201cHail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!\u201d which members of the crowd answered with arms upraised in the familiar Nazi manner.\n\nBut Spencer doesn\u2019t think that these Nazi salutes are the smoking gun proving that his white-nationalist movement is fascist. He texted PBS Newshour producer P.J. Tobia that they were \u201cclearly done in a spirit of irony and exuberance.\u201d On the program NewsOne Now, Spencer said the Nazi salute was done \u201cin fun.\u201d\n\nSpencer\u2019s defense of his followers making a Nazi gesture as being little more than a joke is a familiar protective gesture. Anyone who has dealt with online far-right trolls\u2014the kinds of people who love to photoshop images of contemporary people being sent to concentration camps, along with more clearly jocular cartoons featuring Pepe the Frog\u2014will be familiar with the way grisly, would-be humor is intermixed with bigotry. The intent seems to be to create a kind of plausible deniability, so if the racism is challenged, there is a prepared rejoinder: Can\u2019t you take a joke?\n\nIf the racism is challenged, there is a prepared rejoinder: Can\u2019t you take a joke?\n\nBut the pretext of irony as a way of furthering bigotry isn\u2019t just a tactic wannabe Nazis of the 21st century have developed. It\u2019s actually indistinguishable from how the actual Nazis of the early 20th century behaved. This role irony plays in providing a protective cover for anti-Semitism was brilliantly analyzed by the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre in his book Anti-Semite and Jew (1944), published after France was liberated but while the Holocaust was reaching a crescendo in Europe. Sartre observed that anti-Semites often resorted to the cloak of jokiness:"

    "text": "\u201cIf people are sorted into enclaves and niches, what will happen to their views?\u201d Sunstein asked back in 2007. \u201cWhat are the eventual effects on democracy?\u201d Now that white nationalism has become a mainstream phenomenon, and its most powerful political champion occupies the Oval Office, we have at least one grim answer to that question. We just don\u2019t have the slightest clue about how to address the root of the problem.\n\nOnce liberals got a long-overdue whiff of the stench emanating from the other side of YouTube, Google had itself a little P.R. problem that soon turned into a big one when The Times of London, the Wall Street Journal, and others exposed a much dirtier secret hidden in plain view: YouTube wasn\u2019t just offering up millions of hours of hate speech, but rewarding the most successful propagandists with a cut of the revenue from those video ads you have to wait impatiently to \u201cskip\u201d before getting, say, your \u201c33 Fun Facts About Slavery\u201d (#5: \u201cThere Were Just as Many White Slaves as Black Slaves\u201d). Worse, some of the YouTube ranters were being paid\u2014in one case, millions\u2014to produce noxious content for YouTube\u2019s \u201cpreferred\u201d channel.\n\nAt first, despite a particularly loud outcry in Western Europe, Google pooh-poohed the whole \u201cfinancing of hate\u201d business. Extremists, said the head of Google Europe, were only making \u201cpennies not pounds\u201d off the major brands running ads on their channels. But when advertisers started to pull their brands from the platform in March and April\u2014eventually about 5 percent of YouTube\u2019s advertisers joined in the \u201cboycott\u201d\u2014Google realized it had a problem on its hands. It\u2019s one thing when the Daily Mail and BuzzFeed highlight your hateful content; it\u2019s another when AT&T and Wal-Mart and Toyota start pulling out because you\u2019re running their ads on (in Toyota\u2019s case) \u201cA 6000 Year History of the Jew World Order.\u201d YouTube stood to lose some $750 million from an advertising boycott, analysts estimated\u2014a mere drop in Google\u2019s ocean of ad dollars, but a lousy \u201cindicator\u201d of YouTube\u2019s future profitability.\n\nSince then, Google has done what any self-respecting mega-corporation would do in a situation like this: Take a series of well-publicized half-measures to establish itself as \u201cadvertiser-friendly,\u201d win Wal-Mart back, and get the carping press off its case. (The alt-right has inadvertently done its part to make Google look better, too, organizing\u2014then canceling, post-Charlottesville\u2014nationwide protests of the company for firing an engineer who wrote that women in tech are biologically inferior.) Google changed the kinds of videos that can carry advertising, blocked ads on videos with overt hate speech (which depends entirely on your definition of \u201covert,\u201d and mostly means calls to violence), announced it was funding 50 \u201ccounter-extremist\u201d NGOs to help it find new and creative ways to curb extremist content, and said it would recruit more \u201cTrusted Flaggers\u201d\u2014unpaid volunteers charged with (often inaccurately) \u201cflagging\u201d the worst of the worst for YouTube to deal with.\n\nAs part of this familiar ritual of corporate self-absolution, Google also symbolically \u201cfired\u201d some of the best-known YouTubers it had paid to produce videos. The first big name to go, as a result of the initial Journal expose in February, was its most popular star, with 53 million subscribers, the model-handsome Swedish Gamer PewDiePie (real name: Felix Kjellberg). His offenses were, in the realm of YouTube extremism, minor: Some cheeky Nazi references, some \u201cgratuitous\u201d sex and violence, and one particularly rank stunt in which he paid \u201cfivvers\u201d\u2014people who say they\u2019ll do anything on video for $5\u2014to unfurl a sign reading \u201cDeath to the Jews.\u201d\n\nWhat \u201cfiring\u201d meant, in this case, was \u201cdemonitizing.\u201d\n\nWhat \u201cfiring\u201d meant, in this case, was \u201cdemonitizing\u201d\u2014shunting PewDiePie off the preferred channel and pulling ads from his videos. This, in turn, gave one of Google\u2019s big clients, Nissan\u2014which had paid PewDiePie for an ad of its own\u2014a chance to serve up some self-righteous PR as well. \u201cWe strongly condemn this highly offensive content and will not work with him again,\u201d said a mortally offended Nissan spokesperson. Google, too, could claim to have \u201cdealt with\u201d the PewDiePie threat. But YouTube had already made him an international star. And his content remains wildly popular on YouTube, even without that \u201cpreferred\u201d status, and thus indirectly lucrative (with all the clicks he gets) for Google and all its advertisers; in July, one of his videos garnered almost 10 million views; none of the 23 he posted during the month had an audience of less than 3 million. And what about \u201cDeath to the Jews,\u201d which brought the weight of Google down on him? Just two of the many re-uploads on YouTube have 600,000 views between them, on top of the millions who\u2019ve seen the original. Take that, PewDiePie!\n\nOne of the reasons that YouTube is poised to overtake all of television in audience size, and hours watched, is its seeming benignity. Most liberals\u2014certainly most over the age of 40\u2014still tend to regard Fox News as the primary flame-fanner of the intolerant right, rivaled only by Breitbart News and (for the especially woke) Alex Jones\u2019s InfoWars. So does the mainstream media. While we were busy sharing \u201cReggae Shark,\u201d the platform we knew and loved was fast becoming the Fox News of the new white nationalism\u2014the most efficient tool for spreading bigotry to the masses that\u2019s yet been invented.\n\nJust as we largely ignored the political punch of talk radio in the \u201990s and \u201900s\u2014who could see Michael Savage as a political sage, for heaven\u2019s sake?\u2014we\u2019ve been slow to recognize the (this sounds strange, just saying it) unique menace to democracy, civil society, and plain human decency that YouTube presents.\n\nNow comes the hard part: Figuring out how in God\u2019s name to \u201crespond,\u201d to defang the crypto-Nazi propagandists and effectively troll an army of professional trollers. Google tells us it can be done: Not only can jihadis be shut down, but the budding white nationalists can be un-indoctrinated, by means of the very same technology that created the networks that spawn them. Ross Frennett, CEO of Moonshot CVE, a counter-extremist data firm that\u2019s working with Google, expressed wild optimism last fall in a Newsweek op-ed. \u201cBy marrying big data with personal empathy,\u201d he wrote, \u201cour generation can starve extremist organizations of their ability to recruit, and they will wither on the vine and die.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s Silicon Valley speak for \u201ctechnology can fix everything\u201d\u2014including societal problems that platforms like YouTube have made demonstrably worse. But the most promising fix dreamed up so far, known as the \u201cRedirect Method,\u201d shows the serious limits and pitfalls of such an effort. Redirect sounds good: Google finds out what people want to see when they search for ISIS material (and, coming soon, also \u201cinflammatory religious and supremacist\u201d content), and places advertisements alongside the results that point to counter-information, theoretically disrupting the ideological echo chambers.\n\nBut what makes extremists extreme\u2014whether they\u2019re leftists, right-wingers, fundamentalist Christians, or anti-vaxxers\u2014is a ferocious resistance to anything that contradicts their worldview. When you spend some time with young white nationalists on YouTube, Reddit, or 4chan, you understand that counter-information is nothing but fodder for validating their beliefs. And an attempt to force it on them only reinforces the whole weltanschauung of the new white supremacists: that there\u2019s a massive global conspiracy to disempower white people and destroy Western civilization, accomplished by clamping down on free expression and hiding the dirty \u201ctruth\u201d about race, gender, global finance\u2014everything.\n\nThere are more pragmatic problems, too. Already, YouTube\u2019s light policing of content has resulted in banning journalists and social activists. What happens now that the parameters have expanded to quash \u201csupremacist\u201d and \u201cinflammatory religious\u201d content? As Kieron O\u2019Hara wrote at Slate, in a piece about Redirect, users quickly adapt to such technological tricks: \u201cIn a future world where such techniques were known about and understood, wouldn\u2019t we just stop clicking on ads, especially when seeking edgy or transgressive content?\u201d\n\nOf course we would. In trying to \u201csolve\u201d the problems it\u2019s helped create, Google is also working against human nature\u2014against our tendency to \u201cself-select\u201d and organize ourselves into enclaves, our deep-seated need to belong and to believe. All the human qualities, in other words, that make social media so powerful (for ill and good) in the first place. Of course, Google will only take its counter-extremist efforts so far\u2014far enough to increase profits, rather than drive them down. YouTube can make itself \u201cadvertiser-friendly.\u201d It can inoculate itself from lawsuits filed by victims of extremist violence. It cannot change hearts and minds that are already hardened. That\u2019s our job."

    "text": "Trump insists that the situation at the southern border constitutes a \u201cnational security crisis,\u201d but the facts don\u2019t support his justification for declaring a state of emergency. Border crossings have been in steady decline for more than a decade, undocumented immigrants commit fewer crimes than American-born citizens, most drugs are smuggled into the U.S. through or near legal ports of entry. If Trump really cared about stopping the illegal drug trade, he wouldn\u2019t reportedly be plundering $2.5 billion from the Defense Department\u2019s drug interdiction program as part of his executive gambit to secure more wall funding.\n\nTrump has now set the stage for yet another grueling slugfest in the courts. He\u2019s thrown Senate Republicans in politically treacherous waters by forcing them to choose between the public\u2019s antipathy towards the wall and the GOP base\u2019s enthusiastic support for it. And he\u2019s set a precedent that may allow Democrats to achieve key policy goals without the Senate\u2019s consent the next time they take the White House.\n\n\n\nFirst, Trump\u2019s declaration will likely have little practical impact in the short term. Legal challenges could place the wall funding in limbo for months or even years, like virtually every other major unilateral policy initiative rolled out by the administration. \u201cDid I ever say I was filing a legal challenge?\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters on Thursday. \u201cI may. That\u2019s an option. And we\u2019ll review our options.\u201d A federal appeals court allowed House Democrats to intervene in an Obamacare-related case earlier that day. Even if Democrats or other plaintiffs don\u2019t prevail in the end, delays in the lower courts could effectively run out the clock before the 2020 elections.\n\nWe\u2019ve been here before, most notably with the travel ban. His executive order to bar visa applicants from a several Muslim-majority countries went through three iterations before the Supreme Court signed off on it last June. It\u2019s impossible to know whether the justices would also approve Trump\u2019s state of emergency. Much would depend on the exact legal circumstances of the case, including who brought it and the grounds on which they challenged the declaration. No matter whether they win or lose, Democrats would likely reap some long-term benefits.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine that the Supreme Court strikes down the declaration. Perhaps the justices decide that Trump didn\u2019t act in response to a genuine national emergency, because border crossings have been declining for almost 20 years. Perhaps they decide that the National Emergencies Act of 1976 delegated too much of Congress\u2019 power to the executive branch. In either case, a ruling that constrained the executive branch\u2019s discretion would be welcome under Trump and beyond. Many of Trump\u2019s worst policies\u2014the travel ban, the family-separation policy, and more\u2014came from broadly worded legislation by Congress. Lawmakers should change that approach to lawmaking, and a nudge from the justices wouldn\u2019t hurt."

    "text": "Trump regularly denies that climate change is real, once tweeting that it was \u201ccreated by and for the Chinese\u201d to make America less economically competitive. Since taking office, he\u2019s withdrawn the United States from the Paris climate agreement, championed the U.S. coal mining industry over renewable energy, and placed dogmatic deregulators in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency. Trump once reportedly told aides that he wasn\u2019t worried about the national debt because \u201cI won\u2019t be here.\u201d That attitude also sums up his, and most Republicans\u2019, approach to climate change.\n\nBut their nonchalance is at odds with public opinion on the issue. A Yale/George Mason University poll in February found that fewer than 60 percent of Americans worried about climate change before Trump\u2019s election; that number is now approaching 70 percent. The Obama administration had signed international climate accords and pushed the Clean Power Plan to rein in carbon emissions, giving the appearance of progress on the issue. By shattering those relatively modest efforts, Trump and his allies may inadvertently have convinced more Americans to support climate action.\n\nAmericans, like other animals, occasionally devour their young. The last two decades of policy have not been kind to millennials. Thanks to the Great Recession, they earn less money than boomers and Generation X did at their age. They\u2019re buying fewer homes, paying off their student debts more slowly, and putting less money into their savings. Millennials enjoy far less economic and social stability than their parents did, and it\u2019s taking a psychic toll. Oh, and the world is ending.\n\nThere\u2019s a cottage industry, especially within conservative circles, that tries to blame young Americans for their own problems. Millennials are cast as lazy, coddled, and censorious, thus the supposed proliferation of \u201csafe spaces\u201d and \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d on college campuses and the push for better labor conditions in the workplace. Fox News, whose average viewer is 65 years old, is particularly fond of describing young Americans as naive and out of touch. This backlash is nothing new: A Gallup poll after the Kent State shootings in 1970 found that 58 percent of Americans blamed the students after National Guard fired into a crowd of protesters, killing four students.\n\nAmericans\u2019 views on climate change vary significantly by age. A January survey by Data for Progress found that a majority of millennials and Generation X support the Green New Deal, while a majority of boomers and the Silent Generation oppose it. The generational divide is even apparent among conservatives. In a May 2018 Pew survey, only 44 percent of Republican millennials said they wanted to expand offshore oil and gas drilling compared to 71 percent of Republican boomers. A similar gap\u201443 percent of young Republicans versus 73 percent of older ones\u2014emerged on support for expanded coal mining. What explains this stark age gap? Older Americans tend to be more conservative in general, and they would bear the highest costs for combating climate change while seeing the least benefit from them.\n\nLike the Vietnam protesters of the \u201960s and \u201970s, millennials have shown a knack for mass organizing. Students at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, led nationwide protests against gun violence after 17 of their classmates were massacred last year. The March for Our Lives last year became one of the largest national demonstrations in U.S. history, drawing almost 200,000 people in Washington, D.C., alone. Thunberg, the 16-year-old activist who spoke at Davos, cited their work as an inspiration for the student strikes.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, young also seem to have avoided some of the pitfalls that anti-war protesters fell into almost 50 years ago. Young people also seem to understand that they need to wield political power through the governing process, not just outside of it. Trump\u2019s presidency prompted hundreds of Democratic millennials to run for elected office, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress and the Green New Deal\u2019s highest-profile champion.\n\n\n\nMillennials also seem to have rejected violence as a political tactic. Though the anti-war movement as a whole wasn\u2019t violent, parts of, notably the Weather Underground, committed domestic terrorism. It was also a remarkably violent era in general: The FBI tabulated more than 2,700 bombings in the U.S. in an 18-month span between 1971 and 1972. That helped fuel an electoral backlash from moderates and conservatives, aiding Nixon\u2019s election bids in 1968 and 1972. The anti-war movement ultimately succeeded in shifting public opinion against the war, and Nixon\u2014fresh off his reelection rout of George McGovern, who had advocated for immediate withdrawal\u2014wound down America\u2019s involvement in Vietnam. But the cost was a generational shift toward conservatism.\n\nThe impact of rising global temperatures on civilization will dwarf the Vietnam War\u2019s bloodshed.\n\nThe Vietnam War was a clear mortal threat to young people, tens of millions of whom were eligible to be drafted; nearly 60,000 Americans were killed in the conflict. Climate change presents a different sort of threat to millennials. It\u2019s less immediate than an ongoing war, less visceral than being shot at. But ultimately it will prove more catastrophic. Even if drastic action is taken over the next decade, the impact of rising global temperatures on civilization will dwarf the Vietnam War\u2019s bloodshed. The World Health Organization has projected that come 2030, climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year.\n\nCombatting climate change will take much more effort than ending the Vietnam War, and much longer. It will require a mass movement unlike any America, or even the world, has ever seen. It will also require millennials to succeed where the anti-war left failed a half-century ago: at the ballot box. There can\u2019t be meaningful action as long as climate deniers and slow-walkers are in charge in Washington. The challenge will be to convince enough older voters that global warming is every bit as frightening to millennials as the Vietnam War was to boomers.\n\n\u201cAdults keep saying, \u2018We owe it to the young people to give them hope,\u2019\u201d Thunberg, who was nominated Wednesday for the Nobel Peace Prize, said in January. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want your hope. I don\u2019t want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And then I want you to act. I want you to act as you would in a crisis. I want you to act as if our house is on fire. Because it is.\u201d"

    "text": "PETA, the world\u2019s premier animal rights organization, has been criticized for its tactics, which include comparing the struggle of animals to the struggle of marginalized humans. Oli Scarff/Getty Images\n\nThirty years later, a growing and increasingly vocal group of people beyond the movement proper don\u2019t consider the idea so radical anymore. It\u2019s still a minority viewpoint, but 32 percent of Americans believe animals should have similar protections as humans, according to a 2015 Gallup poll. That number is significantly higher than a 2008 survey finding that 25 percent of people held that belief. Thanks to an expansive nexus of interrelated moral and political concerns, the numbers seem poised to continue spiking, particularly among liberals. At the heart of that nexus is a tentative accord to bring animal rights and animal welfare into alignment with one another\u2014together of course, with human rights and human welfare.\n\nTo get at the underpinnings of this new consensus, let\u2019s start with the environment. The U.S. meat industry is one of the largest sources of water contamination in the country, and a massive contributor to drought in the West. On a global scale, animal agriculture \u201cputs a heavy strain on many of the Earth\u2019s finite land, water, and energy resources,\u201d according to the advocacy group Climate Nexus. \u201cIn order to accommodate the 70 billion animals raised annually for human consumption, a third of the planet\u2019s ice-free land surface, as well as nearly 16 percent of global freshwater, is devoted to growing livestock.\u201d About three quarters of the Brazilian Amazon\u2019s deforestation is attributable to animal agriculture.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s climate change. Agriculture, along with land use and forestry, accounts for a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions globally, with the meat industry making up about one-fifth of those emissions. The biggest emissions source is the animals\u2019 ruminants\u2014a fancy way of saying farts and burps, which get released into the air as methane. Meat agriculture also compounds carbon emissions via widespread deforestation to clear room for raising the animals, and nitrogen-based fertilizer to grow their food.\n\nIn the most immediate way, removing greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector means targeting the meat industry.\n\nIf meat and dairy consumption continue apace, our dietary habits could eventually contribute to an 80 percent spike in global agricultural greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050\u2014which is why any serious plan to tackle climate change has to include restrictions on the animal agriculture sector. The Green New Deal resolution introduced by New York Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example, calls for removing \u201cgreenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is technologically feasible.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a vague suggestion with quite specific implications: In the most immediate way, removing greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector means targeting the meat industry. And targeting the meat industry likely means reducing the number of animals consumed. Thus Republican lawmakers, ever ready to trigger the libs, have taken to claiming that Democrats, in their wild-eyed zeal to stave off an environmental catastrophe that exists only in their overheated imaginations, are going to take away people\u2019s meat. \u201cIf this goes through, this will be outlawed,\u201d Representative Rob Bishop of Utah said of the Green New Deal, as he chewed on a cheeseburger. \u201cI could no longer eat this type of thing.\u201d\n\nBishop, of course, is trolling; the Green New Deal does not ban beef. But he\u2019s also not entirely wrong. It was Peter Singer himself who first raised the issue. \u201cWe are, quite literally, gambling with the future of our planet,\u201d he wrote in Animal Liberation, \u201cfor the sake of hamburgers.\u201d\n\nAnd for the sake of these hamburgers, whose future are we gambling with, specifically?\n\nClimate change is a cataclysm for humans everywhere, but it will be felt more keenly by certain humans. It\u2019s well-documented that minorities, people living in poverty, tribal communities, immigrants, and the elderly suffer disproportionately from problems caused by climate change. These populations are less likely to have the resources and amenities that traditionally protect people from extreme weather, such as soundly built structures, air conditioning, and readily accessible health care.\n\nThe environmental consequences of animal agriculture also markedly skew against the vulnerable. In the United States, \u201cmore than 100,000 miles of rivers and streams, close to 2.5 million acres of lakes, reservoirs and ponds, and more than 800 square miles of bays and estuaries\u201d have poor water quality because of fertilizer runoff partly caused by animal agriculture, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Nutrient pollution has been connected to cancer, birth defects, and the deadly Blue Baby Syndrome\u2014the condition whereby infants deprived of blood oxygen literally turn blue. Water contamination is an especially acute problem for the rural poor, who can\u2019t afford to stockpile bottled water or expensive filtration systems. Fertilizer runoff from meat production has also caused an enormous recurring dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico, threatening the area\u2019s $600 million fishing industry.\n\nThe meat industry is also a disaster for labor.\n\nThe meat industry is also a disaster for labor. Slaughterhouse workers\u2014mainly immigrants and resettled refugees\u2014often face lifelong injuries from their jobs, and likewise are denied the sort of disposable income necessary to treat them. \u201cThey describe punishing rates of production, leaving them with a lifetime of pain and physical problems,\u201d a 2016 NPR report read. \u201cWorkers making on average $12.50 an hour, or about $26,000 a year, say they can get fired if their injuries prevent them from working harder; companies report constant employee turnover.\u201d Those injuries aren\u2019t just physical, but also psychological. \u201cThe worst thing, worse than the physical danger, is the emotional toll,\u201d an Iowa slaughterhouse worker told activist Gail Eisnitz. \u201cPigs down on the kill floor have come up and nuzzled me like a puppy. Two minutes later I had to kill them.\u201d\n\nLeaders on the left wing of the Democratic Party\u2014the only party in this country that can plausibly claim to represent the interests of minorities, low-income workers, immigrants, and other vulnerable people\u2014are perfectly aware of these problems. But their response typically focuses on policy prescriptions aimed at piecemeal solutions rather than more ambitious structural reform. Such proposals include the adoption of new environmental regulations, investment in new technology for low-carbon agriculture, securing a workers\u2019 bill of rights, and expanding workers\u2019 ability to unionize. While these measures, if signed into law under a post-Trump presidency, would certainly start to address some of the environmental and mortal damage caused by animal agriculture, they don\u2019t quite address the crux of the problem.\n\nA more sweeping analytical framework has lately emerged on the left to diagnose a host of ills that are interconnected: The problem, a growing chorus of environmentalists now suggest, might be capitalism itself. Central to this emerging critique is the interpretation of the environmental exploitation of the earth and its inhabitants as a direct outgrowth of unregulated capitalism. Appalling labor conditions, the destruction of the environment in search of profit, a callous disregard toward marginalized communities, the reliance on an unseen underclass to keep the whole bloody machinery running\u2014these are all, in the anticapitalist wing of environmentalism, indelible hallmarks of both the agriculture industry and a rampant market economy. As the essayist Carl Boggs once wrote, \u201cAside from the military, no sector of American society matches the frightening consequences of the meat complex: ecological devastation, food deterioration, routinized violence, injury, disease, and death to both humans and animals, rampant corporate power.\u201d\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal recognizes that massive societal shifts are necessary to stave off climate change\u2014including changes to the agricultural sector. SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThrough proposals like the Green New Deal, the left has recognized that massive societal shifts are necessary to save the planet and achieve equality. And with the Green New Deal\u2019s increasing prominence in the debate over environmental reform, it\u2019s only a matter of time before such shifts will include a serious discussion about the ethics and wisdom of consuming billions of animals every year. Indeed, there are already signs that the discussion has begun: Intercept writer Glenn Greenwald, a fervent animal rights activist, in March launched a video series called Animal Matters, \u201cdevoted to discussions and reporting about all matters concerning animal rights, animal welfare, factory farms, and humanity\u2019s treatment of animals.\u201d\n\nStill, as the reflexive mockery of nearly all things PETA shows, a radical shift in our thinking about animals is hardly under way. It\u2019s tempting to blame this status quo on humanity\u2019s well-documented reluctance to give up bacon and steaks. But the growing recognition in America that animals should be treated \u201chumanely\u201d suggests that there is an opening to argue for reduced meat consumption based on the rights of animals themselves. Such an argument, which would vastly enlarge the pool of historical victims of capitalism\u2019s excesses, would have to learn from the mistakes of the traditional animal rights movement\u2014and atone for more than a few of its sins.\n\nThere will always be some stubborn pocket of popular resistance when it comes to animal rights. Diligent attention to the issue would, after all, require many of us to make a concerted effort not only to stop eating meat, but also to refrain from wearing leather, going to zoos, and doing hundreds of other things based on the exploitation of animals. \u201cUsing animals is a source of pleasure for many people,\u201d said Sue Donaldson, who co-authored with Will Kymlicka the 2011 book Zoopolis: A Political Theory of Animal Rights. \u201cI think strategically, we should support people wherever they are on that transition, and recognize that it\u2019s a difficult thing to do.\u201d That\u2019s one thing the traditional animal-rights movement has never been very good at, and the PETA-led culture of aggressively shaming meat-eaters is something that has to change if people are to embrace animal rights.\n\nCrucially, animal rights activists have to stop comparing the struggle of animals to the struggle of black people in America. Because to many on the old-school human left, animal rights activists aren\u2019t just a bunch of silly vegans. They\u2019re a bunch of racist vegans.\n\nConsider PETA\u2019s infamous tweet about \u201cbringing home the bagels.\u201d In response to some light backlash, the group followed up with this retort:\n\nJust as it became unacceptable to use racist, homophobic, or ableist language, phrases that trivialize cruelty to animals will vanish as more people begin to appreciate animals for who they are and start \u2018bringing home the bagels\u2019 instead of the bacon. \u2014 PETA (@peta) December 4, 2018\n\nPETA makes this comparison all the time, arguing that killing a cow just because it\u2019s a cow is just as bad as killing a black person because she is black. \u201c[We] know that prejudice in all its ugly forms is wrong,\u201d PETA president Ingrid Newkirk wrote in 2017. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who the victim is, but when we witness oppression, we should never let it go unchallenged.\u201d The group, as Sarah Grey and Joe Cleffie argued in a 2015 piece for Jacobin, \u201cis notorious for employing lynching and Holocaust imagery; in 2009, PETA members dressed in Ku Klux Klan robes outside Madison Square Garden to protest the \u2018eugenic\u2019 breeding practices promoted by the Westminster Dog Show.\u201d\n\nPETA\u2019s stance also hails from the founding text of the modern animal rights movement. In Animal Liberation, Peter Singer frequently makes slavery comparisons. He also cites apartheid to argue hypocrisy on the part of well-meaning meat-eaters. \u201cTo protest about bullfighting in Spain, the eating of dogs in South Korea, or the slaughter of baby seals in Canada while continuing to eat eggs from hens who have spent their lives crammed into cages ... is like denouncing apartheid in South Africa while asking your neighbors not to sell their houses to blacks,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut this comparison is flawed and deeply troubling when you consider how racists have long compared oppressed minority groups to dogs and other animals. \u201cThe comparison is calculated to degrade, and it stems from the period when U.S. laws treated enslaved black people as legally equivalent to livestock\u2014categorizing them as subhuman,\u201d Grey and Cleffie write.\n\nTo some, it often feels that people care more about animals than they do about people of color.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that many on the left believe animal rights activism simply serves as a means for white people to ignore the human rights of black people\u2014who, by the way, continue to be oppressed in America. To some, it often feels that people care more about animals than they do about people of color. Burton, who authored the Buzzfeed op-ed on PETA, recalled a conversation in which a woman told her that \u201canimals are treated better by white people than black human beings are.\u201d In a New York Times op-ed, the African-American writer Roxane Gay mourned the shooting of an unarmed black man while the rest of the world mourned the death of Cecil the Lion.\n\nThis is the core problem animal rights groups must atone for, said Will Kymlicka: \u201cWe want other social justice movements to accept animal rights, but it means animal-rights groups need to be much more responsible members of the family.\u201d\n\nHe added, however, that it\u2019s a \u201ctwo-way street.\u201d Social justice movements can\u2019t be too cavalier in dismissing the animals rights movement, because in doing so, they\u2019re arguing that humans are inherently a superior species and thus have moral dominion over the earth. That mindset actually harms the fight for racial, gender, and other social equalities. At least 10 peer-reviewed sociology and psychology studies show that belief in species hierarchy is \u201cconsistently associated with greater dehumanization of disadvantaged or marginalized human groups,\u201d Kymlicka said. \u201cIt exacerbates racism, sexism, homophobia, and reduces support for fair wages for workers.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAlthough these studies are looking at different age groups in different countries using different methods, the finding is always the same: Species hierarchy is bad for social justice movements.\u201d\n\nEvery year in the United States, humans bring about 8.5 billion chickens, 33 million cows, and 112 million pigs into the world for the sole purpose of killing them and serving them on a plate. To most Americans this is a non-issue. Worse, if Democrats were to make lowering meat consumption, by fiat or policy nudges, part of their platform, it would likely be a losing issue.\n\nBut if the last few years have shown us anything, it\u2019s that the assumptions that once undergirded American politics\u2014about what voters want, about the supremacy of the free market, about the very foundations of liberal democracy\u2014are now open to fresh interrogation. The left has seized that opportunity to push the boundaries of debate on a host of subjects, from the economy to the environment to movement-based crusades for social justice. In so doing they have made certain implicit promises. Taken to their logical ends, their proposals suggest the outlines of a broad, holistic case for humans eating much less meat\u2014a case that includes aspects of animal welfare and animal rights.\n\nThis is not to say that animal rights should or will become an all-or-nothing proposition. Policy makers will have to meet voters where they are, while proposing an array of approaches that range from the oblique to the direct. But the benefits of convincing people to eat less meat are clear. Production would decrease. Emissions from livestock would drop. Waterways would flush out pollution; aquifers would replenish. Billions of lives would be saved, human lives very much among them.\n\nOr, you know, we could keep eating hamburgers."

    "text": "President Mauricio Macri of Argentina, another influential hard-right coalition member, also owes favors to Washington. In June, this relationship helped him score the biggest IMF loan in history, $50 billion dollars\u2014subsequently upped to $56.3 billion when the economy did much worse than the IMF had forecast under the agreement. The United States blocked loans to the government of his predecessor and rival from multilateral lending institutions such as the Inter-American Development Bank. Since Argentina was running into balance of payments problems toward the end of President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s term, this was significant. An even bigger blow to her government came from an apparently politically motivated New York judge, who took more than 90 percent of Argentina\u2019s creditors hostage in 2012 by ruling that they could not be paid until certain U.S.-based vulture funds were paid first. All of these problems with the U.S. were quickly resolved soon after Macri took office in 2015.\n\nThe media sometimes singles out President Len\u00edn Moreno of Ecuador to show that there is a \u201ccenter-left\u201d presence in this illegal and somewhat barbaric enterprise. Moreno was indeed elected in 2017 with the support of former president Rafael Corea\u2019s leftist Alianza PAIS party. But he quickly took a sharp turn away from his mandate, forming an alliance with right-wing oligarchs and using extra-constitutional means to consolidate power. He is now trying to put the former president in jail on what look like trumped-up charges. Moreno has been rewarded by Washington with $10 billion in loans from multilateral institutions, including $4.2 billion just scored from the IMF last week. If $10 billion doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, consider that the loan, expressed as a percentage of the Ecuador\u2019s economy, would be equivalent to the U.S. receiving $1.9 trillion. No surprise that Len\u00edn Moreno has joined the Trump Coalition.\n\nThe president of Paraguay also has cause to thank the United States godfather. His party, the Colorado Party, ruled the country for 61 consecutive years, the majority of it under the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner. In 2008, a leftist bishop named Fernando Lugo won the presidency against heavy odds. However, he was toppled in a parliamentary coup in 2012, which was opposed by almost all of South America; once again, Washington worked with the OAS to help legitimize the coup. So, there\u2019s another South American president happy to join the U.S.-led push for a right-wing leader in Venezuela. Yet one more is President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era of Chile, a Pinochet sympathizer who appointed two former allies of the U.S.-backed dictator to his cabinet last year.\n\nThis is how we do it\u2014today, at least. A few years ago\u2014when most of the region was governed by left-of-center governments, Trump wouldn\u2019t have gotten a single government in the region to support an illegal regime change operation. Obama\u2019s secretary of state John Kerry discovered this in 2013 when violent opposition demonstrators were in the streets in Venezuela, trying to overturn Maduro\u2019s first election. There was absolutely no doubt about the election results, and almost every government in the world recognized them. Kerry soon found himself completely isolated; Washington gave in and accepted Maduro\u2019s election.\n\nThen there is Europe, which for a number of historical reasons has only occasionally pursued a foreign policy independent of the United States. This is especially true for Latin America, where the Monroe Doctrine, shamelessly invoked in public by National Security Advisor John Bolton a few days ago, is generally respected. That said, some arm twisting was necessary to flip Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez of Spain, who had rather insubordinately opposed the Trump sanctions against Venezuela even prior to the trade embargo and recognition of Guaid\u00f3 in January. His foreign minister, Josep Borell, told the press that the administration had received \u201cpressure\u201d from Washington. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s PSOE socialist-led government was also under intense pressure from the big Spanish media, which has been in full regime-change mode for some time; they face elections at the end of April. Spain was particularly important in securing European support for this venture, since other countries, including Germany, often take Spain\u2019s view seriously on policy in Latin America.\n\nEven if the Trump team had a global majority\u2014which it doesn\u2019t, with only 50 out of 195 countries worldwide backing Venezuelan regime change\u2014their deadly economic sanctions, theft of assets, military threats, and other actions to topple Venezuela\u2019s government would be no more legal or legitimate than George W. Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq, or the many U.S.-led regime change efforts that have taken place in this hemisphere. That\u2019s unsurprising, given who\u2019s at the wheel: perennial regime-change advocate John Bolton, for example, or special envoy Elliott Abrams, who supported what the UN later found to be genocide in Guatemala, as well as the US-sponsored atrocities in El Salvador and Nicaragua in the 1980s. The cast of characters supporting this regime-change effort, whether in Washington or among some of its closest allies, should underline what is already obvious: The United States\u2019 attempt to oust Maduro has nothing to do with democracy or human rights."

    "text": "There is no practical purpose in giving a 50-year sentence to a 69-year-old defendant like Manafort. And according to the research, the prospect of a 50-year sentence probably wouldn\u2019t have even deterred Manafort if he thought he wouldn\u2019t get caught. What is remarkable about Manafort\u2019s conduct was how serious and repeated his tax and foreign conspiracy violations were. As the sentencing judge put it, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I got caught,\u201d is \u201cnot an inspiring plea for leniency.\u201d And that, indeed, is the bigger moral of Paul Manafort\u2019s long criminal career: for many years, he was not caught.\n\n\n\nWhy? It\u2019s not, as we now know in exhaustive detail, that Manafort was any sort of cunning criminal mastermind. No, he was able, like countless other offenders in the sphere of financial and corporate crime, to exploit enormous loopholes in a porous, under-resourced regime of regulatory capture and indifferent enforcement.\n\nFor many years, the justice system has allowed serious corporate corruption to go unpunished, banks to be prosecuted repeatedly for the same crimes, and corporations and executives to get deferred prosecutions and below-the-guideline sentencing. This system of pronounced judicial leniency has created a punishment model for many corporate offenders that I call \u201ctoo big to jail\u201d\u2014and in recent years, matters have gotten worse. Even within this already skewed and top-heavy system, I have documented declining corporate penalties under the Trump administration. Ending \u201ctoo big to jail,\u201d however, doesn\u2019t mean passing tougher sentences for white-collar crimes. After all, Congress has created plenty of tough new white-collar offenses since the 2001 Enron scandal\u2014and, for the most part, these new tools have sat on the shelf untouched by prosecutors.\n\nInstead of enacting more draconian sentences, we must invest in white-collar law enforcement the same way we invest in other measures to protect public safety. Consider this: the Internal Revenue Service has had its budget cut over the past decade to the point where audits have decreased by 42 percent and the number of tax fraud cases the agency brings has been cut by nearly 25 percent. Under such lax enforcement, tax fraud schemes\u2014of the very sort repeatedly carried out by Paul Manafort\u2014are able to thrive. And while better white-collar crime enforcement is a key, neglected foundation of public safety, the rationale for more sustained and concerted pursuit of white-collar criminals doesn\u2019t end there. These offenses also pose much broader hazards to our well-being. They endanger the national economy\u2014and conspiring with other countries endangers national security\u2014on a far greater scale than the harms wrought by drug possession and street crimes.\n\nThe way out of the double standard we apply to punishment is to reject the notion that true justice inheres in strictly hewing to a one-size-fits-all model of criminal sentencing. To begin using law enforcement as a means of meaningful social reform, we need, rather, to consistently apply the same standards of enforcement to all types of crime: police far more, prosecute and punish far less, utilize evidence-based treatment, and ask that violators give back and make the community whole. Harsh sentences don\u2019t deter crime, but changing the focus of our enforcement systems just might.\n\n"

    "text": "The plan has found support among the Jewish community, including the Jewish umbrella organization known as the CRIF and the Jewish Student Union (UEFJ). \u201cSocial networks are one of the main vectors of anti-Semitic hate, and of hate in general\u2014because it\u2019s also racist hatred, hatred of Muslims, hatred of LGBT people,\u201d Francis Kalifat, president of the CRIF, told me. \u201cFreedom of expression is something that we all cherish, but it must have limits.\u201d\n\nBut given Facebook and Twitter\u2019s history of laxness when it comes to hate speech online, some experts have questioned whether such a plan would be effective. Others criticized the proposed law as draconian and an impingement of free speech. \u201cThe intentions are noble, but the venture is perilous and could create a new victim: the Internet,\u201d wrote one computer scientist in an op-ed for the French newspaper Le Figaro.\n\nAnd while the law has been pitched to the public as a response to the most recent incidents, the uptick in anti-Semitic hate speech and violence predates the Yellow Vests, pointing to a more complicated and subversive source of hate speech\u2014one hard to fight with laws such as this one. Much of the trouble in fighting online anti-Semitism stems from the shift in rhetoric to what some scholars call \u201csoft anti-Semitism\u201d or \u201cnew anti-Semitism.\u201d\n\n53-year-old French comedian Dieudonn\u00e9 M\u2019bala M\u2019bala, who has been convicted multiple times for inciting hatred against Jews, has become a prime example of this type of behavior. Dieudonn\u00e9, as he is known, started out in the early 2000s as a far-left political activist, but is now increasingly associated with the fringes of the far-right. He substitutes the word \u201cZionist\u201d for \u201cJew,\u201d saying things like \u201cZionism killed Christ.\u201d He also invented the \u201cquenelle\u201d salute, a gesture where people grasp their shoulder with one hand and point the other straight to the ground. Many have categorized it as a combination of a French gesture meaning \u201cup yours\u201d and the Nazi salute\u2014with people performing it outside of Auschwitz and French synagogues (it is also popular among the gilets jaunes). Jean-Marie Le Pen, the National Front party founder who has been convicted for Holocaust denial multiple times, is a close friend and serves as the godfather to Dieudonn\u00e9\u2019s daughter.\n\nInstead of the outright slurs of traditional anti-Semitism, this new form takes a more insidious angle, and one particularly hard to combat by filtering out certain words on an online platform. It sees Jews as part of a global elite conspiracy, an establishment controlling everything from the government, to media, to banking institutions. The conspiracy theory aspect has particular currency with the yellow vests. \u201cThey\u2019re all Jews,\u201d a Paris protester\u2019s vest painted with a freemason pyramid read. A yellow vest encampment outside of Lyon featured an immense sign with the words \u201cMacron = Banks = Media = Zion.\u201d\n\nFrance is not alone in its struggle to combat anti-Semitism and the proliferation of other conspiracy theories. In just the past two years, the U.S. has seen protestors in Charlottesville shouting \u201cJews will not replace us!\u201d and a mass shooting that killed 11 people in a Pennsylvania synagogue. Two studies in 2018 found a rise in anti-Semitic content on Twitter and Instagram. And while the House of Representatives voted last week to denounce anti-Semitism in the wake of a controversy wherein Representative Ilhan Omar criticized American policy vis-\u00e0-vis Israel, such efforts fail to address the actual sources of anti-Semitic content in American society\u2014from the dark corners of the internet, to a populist surge, to a president who has peddled conspiracy theories about Jewish billionaire George Soros.\n\nWhile conspiracy theories are notoriously hard to fight, recent research does offer hope. Psychologists point to a combination of miseducation and narcissism as risk factors for conspiracy theory belief. Research has also shown that small and consistent interventions over such beliefs\u2014whether about politics or science\u2014can correct irrational thinking over time. Confronting anti-Semitic claims with evidence, showing their absurdity, is crucial, Lipstadt told me\u2014even if it\u2019s also prudent to keep some distance and avoid validating those acting in bad faith.\n\nAny effective solution requires recognizing anti-Semitism as the problem that it is: not merely a handful of online trolls and not only a threat to Jewish people. \u201cNo healthy democratic society can tolerate having anti-Semitism in its midst,\u201d Lipstadt said. \u201cIf they believe these irrational things about Jews, they\u2019ll believe irrational things about their government. They\u2019ll believe irrational things about the economy. They\u2019ll believe irrational things about their neighbors. Conspiracy theories within a society are very dangerous.\u201d"

    "text": "In the United States, where freedom of expression is guaranteed by the First Amendment, courts have ruled a person must demonstrate physical intent to harm in order to be prosecuted; such a statement of a small-time leftist activist\u2014or even a politician\u2014wouldn\u2019t be taken as a literal threat. Not so in the Netherlands.\n\nWhile freedom of expression is protected under Article 7 of the Dutch constitution, \u201cthis right is not absolute\u201d Tom Herrenberg, Assistant Professor of Constitutional Law at the Open University in the Netherlands explained to me. Article 131 of the Dutch Criminal code prohibits incitement of violence; Article 137c restricts group defamation and Article 137d incitement to hatred or discrimination. Statements that are seen to be inciting violence, even against an inanimate object, are illegal.\n\nWilders was charged with incitement and encouraging discrimination for his speech in 2014, but was given no financial penalty or jail time. Shortly after Kaviaar published her post, by contrast, Dutch police arrived to search her house and arrest her; she was held in isolation for three days. Kaviaar was convicted in December 2013 under Article 131 and given a suspended sentence of prison time. After several appeals and a violation of her operational period\u2014she was arrested while protesting the opening of a detention center for refugees in 2015\u2014she began her seventy-one day prison sentence in January 2019. \u201cEveryone has the right to freedom of movement in order to seek a good life,\u201d she wrote to me from prison, explaining that her texts were \u201cmeant to wake people up, to shake things up.\u201d\n\nIn northern European countries, there is a razor-thin line between what constitutes freedom of expression and what could be defined as statements inciting violence or hatred. \u201cDon\u2019t look for too much coherence or consistency,\u201d Eric Heinze, a law professor at University of London and author of Hate Speech and Democratic Citizenship, told me. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about fundamental rights, like expression, the rule of law really matters,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very distinctive of democracy.\u201d But the statutes and their enforcement aren\u2019t always as clear as one would wish.\n\nAccording to Kaviaar\u2019s lawyer Willem Jebbink, it\u2019s not unusual for people to be charged with inciting violence, hatred, or discrimination in the Netherlands, but \u201c70 to 90 percent of cases don\u2019t go to trial.\u201d It\u2019s unclear why Kaviaar\u2019s case specifically has made it so far in the legal system\u2014though the Dutch secret police has been aware of Kaviaar since at least 2009 when they referenced her texts in a report on so-called extremist migration activism. Her blog receives little traffic, and when the first attempt to take it down was thwarted by Anonymous, authorities did not bother to try again. \u201cIt\u2019s very strange that a text is considered a threat to society and [they] don\u2019t do anything to take it down,\u201d Jebbink told me."

    "text": "There are 14 prominent Democrats who believe they ought to be next president of the United States. As many as a dozen more may join them. But not Eric Holder. Obama\u2019s first attorney general announced on Monday that he had decided against a bid, saying he would instead focus on leading the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a Democratic-aligned group that aims to curb GOP gerrymandering when the states redraw legislative maps after the 2020 census.\n\n\u201cI will do everything I can to ensure that the next Democratic president is not hobbled by a House of Representatives pulled to the extremes by members from gerrymandered districts,\u201d he wrote in a Washington Post op-ed announcing his decision. This is familiar ground for Holder. He warned in this magazine last February that the Trump administration\u2019s proposed citizenship question on the census \u201cwould have devastating consequences on the right to vote and to participate meaningfully in democracy,\u201d and he often calls for the Electoral College\u2019s abolition.\n\nFor the past 20 years, Republicans have exploited structural flaws in American democracy to amass disproportionate political power in Washington. The challenge for Democrats is how to reform that system to achieve their goals. While winning the presidency is an important step in that process, Holder\u2019s decision shows how some of the presidential candidates could better advance a liberal policy agenda by staying out of the 2020 race.\n\nThe current crop of Democratic candidates seems to understand this, to varying degrees. Some have said they will support statehood for the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, which would give representation in Congress to almost four million Americans and dilute the influence of conservative rural states. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren built her campaign around the theme of anti-corruption and proposed a wide-ranging legislative package to undermine special interests\u2019 grip on Washington. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s central theme is how extreme wealth inequality has warped the American democratic process. Without tackling these structural issues, major policy initiatives like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All don\u2019t stand a chance of becoming law."

    "text": "President Mauricio Macri of Argentina, another influential hard-right coalition member, also owes favors to Washington. In June, this relationship helped him score the biggest IMF loan in history, $50 billion dollars\u2014subsequently upped to $56.3 billion when the economy did much worse than the IMF had forecast under the agreement. The United States blocked loans to the government of his predecessor and rival from multilateral lending institutions such as the Inter-American Development Bank. Since Argentina was running into balance of payments problems toward the end of President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s term, this was significant. An even bigger blow to her government came from an apparently politically motivated New York judge, who took more than 90 percent of Argentina\u2019s creditors hostage in 2012 by ruling that they could not be paid until certain U.S.-based vulture funds were paid first. All of these problems with the U.S. were quickly resolved soon after Macri took office in 2015.\n\nThe media sometimes singles out President Len\u00edn Moreno of Ecuador to show that there is a \u201ccenter-left\u201d presence in this illegal and somewhat barbaric enterprise. Moreno was indeed elected in 2017 with the support of former president Rafael Corea\u2019s leftist Alianza PAIS party. But he quickly took a sharp turn away from his mandate, forming an alliance with right-wing oligarchs and using extra-constitutional means to consolidate power. He is now trying to put the former president in jail on what look like trumped-up charges. Moreno has been rewarded by Washington with $10 billion in loans from multilateral institutions, including $4.2 billion just scored from the IMF last week. If $10 billion doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, consider that the loan, expressed as a percentage of the Ecuador\u2019s economy, would be equivalent to the U.S. receiving $1.9 trillion. No surprise that Len\u00edn Moreno has joined the Trump Coalition.\n\nThe president of Paraguay also has cause to thank the United States godfather. His party, the Colorado Party, ruled the country for 61 consecutive years, the majority of it under the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner. In 2008, a leftist bishop named Fernando Lugo won the presidency against heavy odds. However, he was toppled in a parliamentary coup in 2012, which was opposed by almost all of South America; once again, Washington worked with the OAS to help legitimize the coup. So, there\u2019s another South American president happy to join the U.S.-led push for a right-wing leader in Venezuela. Yet one more is President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era of Chile, a Pinochet sympathizer who appointed two former allies of the U.S.-backed dictator to his cabinet last year.\n\nThis is how we do it\u2014today, at least. A few years ago\u2014when most of the region was governed by left-of-center governments, Trump wouldn\u2019t have gotten a single government in the region to support an illegal regime change operation. Obama\u2019s secretary of state John Kerry discovered this in 2013 when violent opposition demonstrators were in the streets in Venezuela, trying to overturn Maduro\u2019s first election. There was absolutely no doubt about the election results, and almost every government in the world recognized them. Kerry soon found himself completely isolated; Washington gave in and accepted Maduro\u2019s election.\n\nThen there is Europe, which for a number of historical reasons has only occasionally pursued a foreign policy independent of the United States. This is especially true for Latin America, where the Monroe Doctrine, shamelessly invoked in public by National Security Advisor John Bolton a few days ago, is generally respected. That said, some arm twisting was necessary to flip Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez of Spain, who had rather insubordinately opposed the Trump sanctions against Venezuela even prior to the trade embargo and recognition of Guaid\u00f3 in January. His foreign minister, Josep Borell, told the press that the administration had received \u201cpressure\u201d from Washington. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s PSOE socialist-led government was also under intense pressure from the big Spanish media, which has been in full regime-change mode for some time; they face elections at the end of April. Spain was particularly important in securing European support for this venture, since other countries, including Germany, often take Spain\u2019s view seriously on policy in Latin America.\n\nEven if the Trump team had a global majority\u2014which it doesn\u2019t, with only 50 out of 195 countries worldwide backing Venezuelan regime change\u2014their deadly economic sanctions, theft of assets, military threats, and other actions to topple Venezuela\u2019s government would be no more legal or legitimate than George W. Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq, or the many U.S.-led regime change efforts that have taken place in this hemisphere. That\u2019s unsurprising, given who\u2019s at the wheel: perennial regime-change advocate John Bolton, for example, or special envoy Elliott Abrams, who supported what the UN later found to be genocide in Guatemala, as well as the US-sponsored atrocities in El Salvador and Nicaragua in the 1980s. The cast of characters supporting this regime-change effort, whether in Washington or among some of its closest allies, should underline what is already obvious: The United States\u2019 attempt to oust Maduro has nothing to do with democracy or human rights."

But after Sheryl Sandberg joined the company from Google in 2008\u2014with the directive to make the company profitable\u2014Facebook embraced extensive user tracking and became one of the most powerful advertising companies in the planet. Its revenue has skyrocketed in the last few years, topping $55 billion in 2018.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the company has become so large and complex that it\u2019s possible no one, including Zuckerberg and Sandberg, really understands it. Facebook is a social network, an advertising company, and a data collection hub that relentlessly surveils and profiles its users. It is being utilized by companies wishing to find new customers, as well as governments looking to foil terrorist attacks (and, increasingly, to meddle in the elections and domestic affairs of adversaries). Its advertising business has played a pivotal role in the decimation of the American news media.\n\n\n\nA site that was once a place for centralizing social obligations\u2014a mix of an address book and a scrap book, a place to easily share milestones and memories with family and friends\u2014has grown into a world unto itself that plays a pivotal, and often damaging, role in democracies and dictatorships alike. It has been seized on by hatemongers across the world, who use it to spread misinformation and messages of ethnic division with frightening speed, facilitating murders in India and genocide in Myanmar.\n\n\n\nFacebook did not invent propaganda or misinformation; mass media has been used to spread hate and violence for as long as mass media has existed. It\u2019s possible, perhaps even likely, that many of the malicious acts that are blamed on Facebook would have happened without it, but the social network has nevertheless been a kind of inadvertent pathfinder, a company so convinced of its public utility that it was, until it was too late, blind to its numerous adverse effects. But Facebook has made it easier to unleash these negative forces and to harness the internet for horrific acts, and it will take more than an apology tour to undo the damage.\n\n\n\nFacebook will change dramatically over the next 15 years. The rise of deepfakes is already making the problem of fake news\u2014the real kind, not the Trumpian insult\u2014seem quaint. How will augmented reality be used for evil? We can only imagine. But it requires little imagination to see that Facebook is ill-equipped to handle these future threats, given its utter failure to address myriad crises ranging from its handling of user data to its spread of misinformation that may have compromised elections in the U.S., Germany, and elsewhere.\n\n"

    "text": "In the United States, where freedom of expression is guaranteed by the First Amendment, courts have ruled a person must demonstrate physical intent to harm in order to be prosecuted; such a statement of a small-time leftist activist\u2014or even a politician\u2014wouldn\u2019t be taken as a literal threat. Not so in the Netherlands.\n\nWhile freedom of expression is protected under Article 7 of the Dutch constitution, \u201cthis right is not absolute\u201d Tom Herrenberg, Assistant Professor of Constitutional Law at the Open University in the Netherlands explained to me. Article 131 of the Dutch Criminal code prohibits incitement of violence; Article 137c restricts group defamation and Article 137d incitement to hatred or discrimination. Statements that are seen to be inciting violence, even against an inanimate object, are illegal.\n\nWilders was charged with incitement and encouraging discrimination for his speech in 2014, but was given no financial penalty or jail time. Shortly after Kaviaar published her post, by contrast, Dutch police arrived to search her house and arrest her; she was held in isolation for three days. Kaviaar was convicted in December 2013 under Article 131 and given a suspended sentence of prison time. After several appeals and a violation of her operational period\u2014she was arrested while protesting the opening of a detention center for refugees in 2015\u2014she began her seventy-one day prison sentence in January 2019. \u201cEveryone has the right to freedom of movement in order to seek a good life,\u201d she wrote to me from prison, explaining that her texts were \u201cmeant to wake people up, to shake things up.\u201d\n\nIn northern European countries, there is a razor-thin line between what constitutes freedom of expression and what could be defined as statements inciting violence or hatred. \u201cDon\u2019t look for too much coherence or consistency,\u201d Eric Heinze, a law professor at University of London and author of Hate Speech and Democratic Citizenship, told me. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about fundamental rights, like expression, the rule of law really matters,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very distinctive of democracy.\u201d But the statutes and their enforcement aren\u2019t always as clear as one would wish.\n\nAccording to Kaviaar\u2019s lawyer Willem Jebbink, it\u2019s not unusual for people to be charged with inciting violence, hatred, or discrimination in the Netherlands, but \u201c70 to 90 percent of cases don\u2019t go to trial.\u201d It\u2019s unclear why Kaviaar\u2019s case specifically has made it so far in the legal system\u2014though the Dutch secret police has been aware of Kaviaar since at least 2009 when they referenced her texts in a report on so-called extremist migration activism. Her blog receives little traffic, and when the first attempt to take it down was thwarted by Anonymous, authorities did not bother to try again. \u201cIt\u2019s very strange that a text is considered a threat to society and [they] don\u2019t do anything to take it down,\u201d Jebbink told me."

    "text": "The notion that the GOP is the party of fiscal responsibility is one of the most persistent myths in American politics. Republican presidential administrations have consistently driven up the deficit\u2014the amount that government spending exceeds revenue\u2014over the past four decades. The 1981 tax cut signed into law by Ronald Reagan, which slashed the rate for the highest earners from 70 to 50 percent, \u201cled to an explosion in the budget deficit, hitting close to 6 percent of gross domestic product in 1983\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Daniel Drezner observed last year. When that tax cut failed to pay for itself and the deficit ballooned, the Reagan administration responded with a series of largely forgotten tax increases\u2014while also passing the landmark Tax Reform Act of 1986, which further cut the top rate to 28 percent.\n\nReagan\u2019s deficit shenanigans became the playbook for generations of conservative policymakers. \u201cBy creating a fiscal straitjacket through lower taxes, conservatives leave Washington with less money and raise the specter of deficits damaging the economy as a rationale to take away the benefits that millions of Americans depend on,\u201d wrote Julian Zelizer in The Atlantic shortly before Trump signed his cuts into law. George W. Bush, meanwhile, squandered a budget surplus by gifting enormous tax cuts to the rich, then blew up the deficit to pay for two failed wars.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have dutifully focused on reducing the deficit. Bill Clinton began his administration by signing a bill that increased taxes and cut spending; it squeaked through Congress with zero Republican votes. He would go on to embrace the language of fiscal discipline and benefit cuts, signing a welfare reform bill into law that has had devastating reverberations to this day. In a 1993 speech outlining an economic program that would lead to budget surpluses by the end of the decade, Clinton presented deficit reduction as a precursor to social spending. \u201cWe\u2019re not cutting the deficit just because experts say it\u2019s the thing to do, or because it has some intrinsic merit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to cut the deficit because the more we spend paying off the debt, the less tax dollars we have to invest in jobs and education and the future of this country.\u201d (During the 2016 campaign, his wife, Hillary Clinton echoed this line.) By the time Clinton left office, the $290 billion budget deficit he had inherited had been transformed into a $124 billion surplus.\n\nLike Clinton, Obama dealt with a Republican Congress for much of his time in office and made similar concessions and overtures, tailoring budgets and programs like the Affordable Care Act to conservative demands for deficit reduction. Even though Democrats controlled both houses of Congress at the time, the hunt for Republican votes\u2014and perhaps intoxicated by his belief that he could transcend partisan politics\u2014guided much of the bill\u2019s framing. (Obama did also have to contend with the then-powerful conservative Blue Dog Coalition.) The Affordable Care Act was convoluted and made less ambitious in part due to concerns about the deficit\u2014concerns that also guided the administration\u2019s decision to push for smaller stimuluses during the Great Recession than economists recommended, as well as its approach to budget negotiations. If the goal was to control the deficit, it worked. The deficit spiked early in Obama\u2019s presidency due to a combination of Bush leftovers, economic stimulus, and automatic increases in social spending caused by the recession, but he left it roughly where he inherited it.\n\n\n\nWhere has this gotten Democrats, politically? Nowhere. Republicans have consistently rejected Democratic proposals that would reduce the deficit, and there\u2019s no evidence that voters have rewarded Democrats for their fiscal responsibility. But Democrats continue to live in fear of being seen as the party of reckless spending and \u201cfree stuff.\u201d At the start of the current Congress, Nancy Pelosi pushed the Democratic House to adopt archaic and unnecessary pay-as-you-go rules that would require any new spending to be offset by tax increases or spending cuts\u2014a plan that would make bold new policies like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal impossible to pass. As The American Prospect\u2019s Robert Kuttner wrote last month, \u201cDemocrats\u2019 restoring a PAYGO rule ignores a three decades history of getting fleeced, and is worse than nothing. It is like wearing a sign that says to Republicans, \u2018Kick me.\u2019 To the broad voting public it signals nothing at all.\u201d\n\n"

    "text": "In 1989, citizens rose up and tore down the Berlin Wall. As the people toppled statues of Communist leaders in cities across Eastern Europe and rallied in their central squares, world leaders declared a victory for freedom. Meanwhile, economists from Harvard and experts at the International Monetary Fund intervened with a suite of privatization and deregulation measures known by the disturbing shorthand \u201cshock therapy.\u201d Almost overnight, prices for food and utilities skyrocketed. In the former German Democratic Republic, joblessness reached 40 percent; in Russia, inflation spiked to 2,500 percent. GDP plummeted, banks collapsed, and people lost their life savings in sprawling pyramid schemes.\n\nThe architects of regime change believed that such problems were a reasonable price to pay for the stable democratic governments that would emerge under free markets. But Levi jeans and Marlboro Lights did little to assuage the pain inflicted by swift liberalization. Almost 30 years later, many of these nations are sliding backward\u2014into the arms of new authoritarian strongmen. Scholars have debated the reasons for this. Why has Hungary embraced an illiberal leader so soon after rejecting communism? Why is Poland, the poster child for economic liberalization, going through its own retrenchment? The answer, at least in part, is that Americans failed to consider how shock therapy reforms might contribute to inequality\u2014which can, in turn, devastate the social trust necessary to sustain and consolidate a newly liberal polity.\n\nThe instability that results from recasting a country\u2019s economy has a subtler impact than military intervention, but it can be just as traumatic, taxing entire generations psychologically, exacting a death toll of its own, and creating the social conditions ripe for new autocratic leaders to take power.\n\nIn Russia, between 1991 and 1994, life expectancy fell by five years; the transition was blamed for at least a million early deaths. In Germany, researchers found that increased mortality rates were directly related to the social upheavals that East Germans refer to as \u201cthe Change.\u201d Psychosocial stress and micronutrient deficiencies combined to leave a lasting mark on a generation of children as well. Babies born as the transition began were on average one centimeter shorter than those born before or after them\u2014about the height differential you might find in a war zone."

    "title": "The Weak Case for Packing the Supreme Court",
    "authors": [
      "Matt Ford"

    "text": "The current debate surrounding court-packing may lack depth, but it\u2019s rapidly growing in breadth. A network of liberal groups and activists have taken up the issue, including Indivisible and the aptly named Pack the Courts. Harvard law professors Laurence Tribe and Mark Tushnet formed the 1.20.21 Project, which calls for four additional Supreme Court seats and an expanded bench in the lower federal courts. A poll in November by Fix the Court, a nonprofit judicial watchdog group, found that 42 percent of Democrats would favor court-packing over other structural reforms for the high court, like term limits.\n\n\n\nThis strategy isn\u2019t without pitfalls. For starters, any packed Supreme Court majority could prove to be only transitory. With the court-packing taboo broken, there would be nothing to stop the GOP from expanding it again whenever they next take both houses of Congress and the presidency. The result would transform the Supreme Court into something closer to Britain\u2019s House of Lords, where governments can simply add new members whenever they want to secure control of the chamber. The only way court-packing would give liberals a permanent victory is if the GOP never took full control of the government\u2014an unlikely prospect at best.*\n\nCourt-packing\u2019s proponents haven\u2019t yet made the case for such extraordinary measures. Some on the left point to justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh as justification enough. \u201cWe don\u2019t consider those two seats that Trump has filled to be legitimate,\u201d Brian Fallon, the executive director of Demand Justice, a leading liberal judicial advocacy group, told The Washington Post. Gorsuch in particular is viewed as illegitimate. In 2016, after Antonin Scalia\u2019s death, McConnell refused to allow a vote on Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, Merrick Garland; Trump, once president, then nominated Gorsuch. McConnell later called his decision to block Garland\u2019s nomination \u201cthe most consequential thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\n\nMcConnell will be damned in American history for his shameless hyper-partisanship, but his actions did not amount to an illegitimate theft of the seat. The president has every right to nominate a Supreme Court justice, and the Senate has every right to ignore him. McConnell\u2019s decision essentially turned the 2016 presidential election into a referendum on the future of the Supreme Court. Republicans saw the stakes\u2014the first five-justice liberal bloc since the Warren Court\u2014and rallied behind the least-qualified major-party presidential candidate in the history of the republic. Democrats and the left stayed home in key states. And while Kavanaugh\u2019s behavior during the confirmation hearings should have disqualified him from a seat on the court, the Senate disagreed.\n\nWhat\u2019s left is a raw utilitarian argument. The Supreme Court likely will be a bulwark of conservative legal rulings for the next generation. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer are 85 and 80 years old, respectively. Justice Clarence Thomas, the oldest conservative justice, once reportedly vowed to serve on the court until the 2030s. Democrats could win every federal election until then and still see their legislative projects\u2014Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and more\u2014struck down by the court."

    "text": "Juventus, meanwhile, issued a statement praising Ronaldo\u2019s \u201cprofessionalism and dedication,\u201d adding, \u201cThe events allegedly dating back to almost 10 years ago do not change this opinion, which is shared by anyone who has come into contact with this great champion.\u201d Fernando Gomes, president of Portugal\u2019s soccer federation, said, \u201cIn my name and in the name of the Portuguese Football Federation, I express total solidarity with Cristiano Ronaldo, in a circumstance where his good name and reputation are at risk.\u201d\n\nSome Italian news outlets ignored the rape accusation until it started to affect Juventus\u2019 share price, said Susy Campanale, a soccer journalist who edits the Football Italia website. (The club\u2019s stock stabilized in late October.) And some papers explicitly sided with him. \u201cCristiano Crucified,\u201d declared the sports daily Corriere dello Sport. Tuttosport ran his photograph beside the headline \u201cPi\u00f9 forte del fango,\u201d or \u201cstronger than the mud-slinging.\u201d\n\nOn social media, Italian soccer fans initially split along partisan lines, with Juventus supporters defending him and rivals reveling in the possibility of his downfall. But what controversy there was has since subsided. \u201cPeople in Italy didn\u2019t care about it at all,\u201d said Ilaria Maroni, an Italian sports writer based in New York. \u201cThe majority of the people didn\u2019t believe the story was true. They only believed the girl wanted to get more money out of it.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo wit, the Italian newspaper La Repubblica was inundated with hostile comments after publishing a letter in October from a 27-year-old woman who criticized Juventus\u2019 statement of support for Ronaldo. Mayorga \u201ccannot say she has been raped,\u201d one commenter wrote. \u201cEither she was giving consent, or she staged the whole thing to get money.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was disconcerting, yet really not that surprising, to see the reaction from women,\u201d said Campanale, of Football Italia. \u201cThey tended to range from \u2018He\u2019s rich, handsome and successful, he doesn\u2019t need to rape anybody\u2019 to \u2018If a woman is raped, she goes to the police straight away and doesn\u2019t accept a payout.\u2019\u201d\n\nMayorga has not spoken publicly since Der Spiegel published the story, and her lawyer, Leslie Stovall, did not respond to a request for comment. But Antje Windmann, one of the reporters who worked on the story for Der Spiegel, said she has spoken with Mayorga about the reaction to her allegation. \u201cShe was desperate and heartbroken about what people think about her now\u2014that she wants his money or that she\u2019s a disappointed lover,\u201d Windmann said. \u201cShe felt completely helpless.\u201d\n\nThe allegation is not the first #MeToo claim to meet a cold reception in Italy. After Italian film actress and director Asia Argento accused Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault in 2017, she said she felt \u201cdoubly crucified\u201d\u2014first by the assault itself, then by the hostile reaction in her home country. Argento\u2019s case offers a prime example of Italy\u2019s broader \u201cvictim-blaming culture,\u201d said Farren, the Women\u2019s March organizer.\n\n\u201c#MeToo, I think it\u2019s fair to say, just has not been a cultural phenomenon in Italy the way it has been elsewhere,\u201d said Rachel Vogelstein, who runs the Women and Foreign Policy Program at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThe media still remains hostile to women who speak out, so I think the conversation continues to remain an uphill battle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Happens When the World\u2019s Most Famous Athlete Is Accused of Rape?\u201d a New York magazine story asked in early October. \u201cThis is the most famous athlete on the planet credibly accused of a heinous crime of sexual assault,\u201d Will Leitch wrote, referring to Ronaldo. \u201cIt is unprecedented, and it is going to tell us everything about how the world of #MeToo is either going to crash against the world of sports or become a part of it.\u201d\n\nThe answer thus far to the article\u2019s question is clear: Not much happens at all. Ronaldo continues to play every week, with nary a mention about the allegations against him.\n\nWhile Italy\u2019s resistance to the #MeToo movement has certainly helped Ronaldo, so too has his prowess on the pitch. \u201cSoccer is an extremely protective environment\u201d in Italy, Farren said. \u201cSoccer comes before almost anything.\u201d But it\u2019s not just soccer. #MeToo has yet to make inroads in the sports world, where tribal affinities often outweigh ethical concerns\u2014even in the U.S., where the movement originated and has been the most influential.\n\nBig-name American athletes have been accused of sexual misconduct over the years, often with only minor consequences. Former L.A. Lakers guard Kobe Bryant and Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger were accused of sexual assault at the peak of their careers; they lost endorsement deals, but not their jobs. Their cases also predated #MeToo. In a more recent case, quarterback Jameis Winston was the number-one pick in the 2015 NFL draft despite a rape accusation against him, and he continued to play this season after a second allegation surfaced in September.\n\n\u201cBroadly speaking, the world of professional sports to date has not really been significantly changed by #MeToo,\u201d said Vogelstein, the Council on Foreign Relations official. \u201cThat world is really notorious for silencing claims of sexual violence.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe accusation against Ronaldo differs in some important respects from many of the stories that have surfaced during the #MeToo era. Mayorga was not Ronaldo\u2019s subordinate, or even involved in the sports industry; he was unlikely to make or break her career. Unlike Weinstein or Bill Cosby, Ronaldo has not been charged with a crime. It\u2019s possible that soccer fans, the media, and corporate sponsors are withholding judgment until Las Vegas police completes its investigation. Then again, accused men have suffered professional repercussions before the conclusion of official inquiries, or even in their absence.\n\n\n\nThe muted reaction may have more to do with the gender dynamics of sports than the details of the legal process. \u201cSports fandom is so invested in this elite form of masculinity that really in some ways is consistent with sexual aggression,\u201d said Susan Cahn, a history professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo who studies gender in sports. \u201cMale athletes in their prime really represent a kind of virility that\u2019s physical but also sexual.\u201d\n\nFans \u201cwant to escape daily life, and so anything that enters into the sports realm or enters into this escape mechanism really turns them off,\u201d said Adam Earnheardt, an expert on sports fandom who chairs the communications department at Youngstown State University in Ohio. When NFL players knelt during the national anthem, some fans were upset simply because the protests \u201cwere violating their escape,\u201d Earnheardt said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to think about politics.\u201d\n\nStill, he said, Roethlisberger faced criticism from fans who once cheered for him. And memories of the accusation against Bryant have lingered: In October, he was removed from the jury of a cartoon film festival he was slated to judge after backlash from the animation community. \u201cThe Ronaldo story would have had greater attention, would have had probably a bigger reaction, if he were a sports star in the United States,\u201d Earnheardt said.\n\nJuventus has ten official supporters clubs in the United States. Fabrizio Capobianco, an Italian expat, founded the Silicon Valley branch in 2015. He said his club\u2019s membership has almost doubled, to more than 100 people, since Ronaldo joined the team. \u201cHe has changed the way the team plays,\u201d Capobianco said. \u201cThey just walk into the pitch knowing they are going to win because the best player on the planet is playing with them.\u201d\n\nAs for the rape accusation, Capobianco says it hasn\u2019t been a major concern for the California-based Juventus fans who gather every weekend to cheer on their new hero. In Italy, he noted, \u201cSoccer is first and everything else comes after.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs long as he doesn\u2019t actually go to jail and he can play on Sunday, I think people will be fine,\u201d Capobianco said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this disappears.\u201d"

    "text": "I taught many wonderful young people during my years in the Ivy League\u2014bright, thoughtful, creative kids whom it was a pleasure to talk with and learn from. But most of them seemed content to color within the lines that their education had marked out for them. Very few were passionate about ideas. Very few saw college as part of a larger project of intellectual discovery and development. Everyone dressed as if they were ready to be interviewed at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nLook beneath the fa\u00e7ade of seamless well-adjustment, and what you often find are toxic levels of fear, anxiety, and depression, of emptiness and aimlessness and isolation. A large-scale survey of college freshmen recently found that self-reports of emotional well-being have fallen to their lowest level in the study\u2019s 25-year history.\n\nSo extreme are the admission standards now that kids who manage to get into elite colleges have, by definition, never experienced anything but success. The prospect of not being successful terrifies them, disorients them. The cost of falling short, even temporarily, becomes not merely practical, but existential. The result is a violent aversion to risk. You have no margin for error, so you avoid the possibility that you will ever make an error. Once, a student at Pomona told me that she\u2019d love to have a chance to think about the things she\u2019s studying, only she doesn\u2019t have the time. I asked her if she had ever considered not trying to get an A in every class. She looked at me as if I had made an indecent suggestion.\n\nThere are exceptions, kids who insist, against all odds, on trying to get a real education. But their experience tends to make them feel like freaks. One student told me that a friend of hers had left Yale because she found the school \u201cstifling to the parts of yourself that you\u2019d call a soul.\u201d\n\n\u201cReturn on investment\u201d: that\u2019s the phrase you often hear today when people talk about college. What no one seems to ask is what the \u201creturn\u201d is supposed to be. Is it just about earning more money? Is the only purpose of an education to enable you to get a job? What, in short, is college for?\n\nThe first thing that college is for is to teach you to think. That doesn\u2019t simply mean developing the mental skills particular to individual disciplines. College is an opportunity to stand outside the world for a few years, between the orthodoxy of your family and the exigencies of career, and contemplate things from a distance.\n\nLearning how to think is only the beginning, though. There\u2019s something in particular you need to think about: building a self. The notion may sound strange. \u201cWe\u2019ve taught them,\u201d David Foster Wallace once said, \u201cthat a self is something you just have.\u201d But it is only through the act of establishing communication between the mind and the heart, the mind and experience, that you become an individual, a unique being\u2014a soul. The job of college is to assist you to begin to do that. Books, ideas, works of art and thought, the pressure of the minds around you that are looking for their own answers in their own ways.\n\nCollege is not the only chance to learn to think, but it is the best. One thing is certain: If you haven\u2019t started by the time you finish your B.A., there\u2019s little likelihood you\u2019ll do it later. That is why an undergraduate experience devoted exclusively to career preparation is four years largely wasted.\n\nElite schools like to boast that they teach their students how to think, but all they mean is that they train them in the analytic and rhetorical skills that are necessary for success in business and the professions. Everything is technocratic\u2014the development of expertise\u2014and everything is ultimately justified in technocratic terms.\n\nReligious colleges\u2014even obscure, regional schools that no one has ever heard of on the coasts\u2014often do a much better job in that respect. What an indictment of the Ivy League and its peers: that colleges four levels down on the academic totem pole, enrolling students whose SAT scores are hundreds of points lower than theirs, deliver a better education, in the highest sense of the word.\n\nAt least the classes at elite schools are academically rigorous, demanding on their own terms, no? Not necessarily. In the sciences, usually; in other disciplines, not so much. There are exceptions, of course, but professors and students have largely entered into what one observer called a \u201cnonaggression pact.\u201d Students are regarded by the institution as \u201ccustomers,\u201d people to be pandered to instead of challenged. Professors are rewarded for research, so they want to spend as little time on their classes as they can. The profession\u2019s whole incentive structure is biased against teaching, and the more prestigious the school, the stronger the bias is likely to be. The result is higher marks for shoddier work.\n\nIt is true that today\u2019s young people appear to be more socially engaged than kids have been for several decades and that they are more apt to harbor creative or entrepreneurial impulses. But it is also true, at least at the most selective schools, that even if those aspirations make it out of college\u2014a big \u201cif\u201d\u2014they tend to be played out within the same narrow conception of what constitutes a valid life: affluence, credentials, prestige.\n\nExperience itself has been reduced to instrumental function, via the college essay. From learning to commodify your experiences for the application, the next step has been to seek out experiences in order to have them to commodify. The New York Times reports that there is now a thriving sector devoted to producing essay-ready summers, but what strikes one is the superficiality of the activities involved: a month traveling around Italy studying the Renaissance, \u201ca whole day\u201d with a band of renegade artists. A whole day!\n\nI\u2019ve noticed something similar when it comes to service. Why is it that people feel the need to go to places like Guatemala to do their projects of rescue or documentation, instead of Milwaukee or Arkansas? When students do stay in the States, why is it that so many head for New Orleans? Perhaps it\u2019s no surprise, when kids are trained to think of service as something they are ultimately doing for themselves\u2014that is, for their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. \u201cDo well by doing good,\u201d goes the slogan. How about just doing good?\n\nIf there is one idea, above all, through which the concept of social responsibility is communicated at the most prestigious schools, it is \u201cleadership.\u201d \u201cHarvard is for leaders,\u201d goes the Cambridge clich\u00e9. To be a high-achieving student is to constantly be urged to think of yourself as a future leader of society. But what these institutions mean by leadership is nothing more than getting to the top. Making partner at a major law firm or becoming a chief executive, climbing the greasy pole of whatever hierarchy you decide to attach yourself to. I don\u2019t think it occurs to the people in charge of elite colleges that the concept of leadership ought to have a higher meaning, or, really, any meaning.\n\nThe irony is that elite students are told that they can be whatever they want, but most of them end up choosing to be one of a few very similar things. As of 2010, about a third of graduates went into financing or consulting at a number of top schools, including Harvard, Princeton, and Cornell. Whole fields have disappeared from view: the clergy, the military, electoral politics, even academia itself, for the most part, including basic science. It\u2019s considered glamorous to drop out of a selective college if you want to become the next Mark Zuckerberg, but ludicrous to stay in to become a social worker. \u201cWhat Wall Street figured out,\u201d as Ezra Klein has put it, \u201cis that colleges are producing a large number of very smart, completely confused graduates. Kids who have ample mental horsepower, an incredible work ethic and no idea what to do next.\u201d\n\nFor the most selective colleges, this system is working very well indeed. Application numbers continue to swell, endowments are robust, tuition hikes bring ritual complaints but no decline in business. Whether it is working for anyone else is a different question.\n\nIt almost feels ridiculous to have to insist that colleges like Harvard are bastions of privilege, where the rich send their children to learn to walk, talk, and think like the rich. Don\u2019t we already know this? They aren\u2019t called elite colleges for nothing. But apparently we like pretending otherwise. We live in a meritocracy, after all.\n\nThe sign of the system\u2019s alleged fairness is the set of policies that travel under the banner of \u201cdiversity.\u201d And that diversity does indeed represent nothing less than a social revolution. Princeton, which didn\u2019t even admit its first woman graduatestudent until 1961\u2014a year in which a grand total of one (no doubt very lonely) African American matriculated at its college\u2014is now half female and only about half white. But diversity of sex and race has become a cover for increasing economic resegregation. Elite colleges are still living off the moral capital they earned in the 1960s, when they took the genuinely courageous step of dismantling the mechanisms of the WASP aristocracy.\n\nThe truth is that the meritocracy was never more than partial. Visit any elite campus across our great nation, and you can thrill to the heart-warming spectacle of the children of white businesspeople and professionals studying and playing alongside the children of black, Asian, and Latino businesspeople and professionals. Kids at schools like Stanford think that their environment is diverse if one comes from Missouri and another from Pakistan, or if one plays the cello and the other lacrosse. Never mind that all of their parents are doctors or bankers.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t a few exceptions, but that is all they are. In fact, the group that is most disadvantaged by our current admissions policies are working-class and rural whites, who are hardly present on selective campuses at all. The only way to think these places are diverse is if that\u2019s all you\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nLet\u2019s not kid ourselves: The college admissions game is not primarily about the lower and middle classes seeking to rise, or even about the upper-middle class attempting to maintain its position. It is about determining the exact hierarchy of status within the upper-middle class itself. In the affluent suburbs and well-heeled urban enclaves where this game is principally played, it is not about whether you go to an elite school. It\u2019s about which one you go to. It is Penn versus Tufts, not Penn versus Penn State. It doesn\u2019t matter that a bright young person can go to Ohio State, become a doctor, settle in Dayton, and make a very good living. Such an outcome is simply too horrible to contemplate.\n\nThis system is exacerbating inequality, retarding social mobility, perpetuating privilege, and creating an elite that is isolated from the society that it\u2019s supposed to lead. The numbers are undeniable. In 1985, 46 percent of incoming freshmen at the 250 most selective colleges came from the top quarter of the income distribution. By 2000, it was 55 percent. As of 2006, only about 15 percent of students at the most competitive schools came from the bottom half. The more prestigious the school, the more unequal its student body is apt to be. And public institutions are not much better than private ones. As of 2004, 40 percent of first-year students at the most selective state campuses came from families with incomes of more than $100,000, up from 32 percent just five years earlier.\n\nThe major reason for the trend is clear. Not increasing tuition, though that is a factor, but the ever-growing cost of manufacturing children who are fit to compete in the college admissions game. The more hurdles there are, the more expensive it is to catapult your kid across them. Wealthy families start buying their children\u2019s way into elite colleges almost from the moment they are born: music lessons, sports equipment, foreign travel (\u201cenrichment\u201d programs, to use the all-too-perfect term)\u2014most important, of course, private-school tuition or the costs of living in a place with top-tier public schools. The SAT is supposed to measure aptitude, but what it actually measures is parental income, which it tracks quite closely. Today, fewer than half of high-scoring students from low-income families even enroll at four-year schools.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t that there aren\u2019t more qualified lower-income kids from which to choose. Elite private colleges will never allow their students\u2019 economic profile to mirror that of society as a whole. They can\u2019t afford to\u2014they need a critical mass of full payers and they need to tend to their donor base\u2014and it\u2019s not even clear that they\u2019d want to.\n\nAnd so it is hardly a coincidence that income inequality is higher than it has been since before the Great Depression, or that social mobility is lower in the United States than in almost every other developed country. Elite colleges are not just powerless to reverse the movement toward a more unequal society; their policies actively promote it.\n\nIs there anything that I can do, a lot of young people have written to ask me, to avoid becoming an out-of-touch, entitled little shit? I don\u2019t have a satisfying answer, short of telling them to transfer to a public university. You cannot cogitate your way to sympathy with people of different backgrounds, still less to knowledge of them. You need to interact with them directly, and it has to be on an equal footing: not in the context of \u201cservice,\u201d and not in the spirit of \u201cmaking an effort,\u201d either\u2014swooping down on a member of the college support staff and offering to \u201cbuy them a coffee,\u201d as a former Yalie once suggested, in order to \u201cask them about themselves.\u201d\n\nInstead of service, how about service work? That\u2019ll really give you insight into other people. How about waiting tables so that you can see how hard it is, physically and mentally? You really aren\u2019t as smart as everyone has been telling you; you\u2019re only smarter in a certain way. There are smart people who do not go to a prestigious college, or to any college\u2014often precisely for reasons of class. There are smart people who are not \u201csmart.\u201d\n\nI am under no illusion that it doesn\u2019t matter where you go to college. But there are options. There are still very good public universities in every region of the country. The education is often impersonal, but the student body is usually genuinely diverse in terms of socioeconomic background, with all of the invaluable experiential learning that implies.\n\nU.S. News and World Report supplies the percentage of freshmen at each college who finished in the highest 10 percent of their high school class. Among the top 20 universities, the number is usually above 90 percent. I\u2019d be wary of attending schools like that. Students determine the level of classroom discussion; they shape your values and expectations, for good and ill. It\u2019s partly because of the students that I\u2019d warn kids away from the Ivies and their ilk. Kids at less prestigious schools are apt to be more interesting, more curious, more open, and far less entitled and competitive.\n\nIf there is anywhere that college is still college\u2014anywhere that teaching and the humanities are still accorded pride of place\u2014it is the liberal arts college. Such places are small, which is not for everyone, and they\u2019re often fairly isolated, which is also not for everyone. The best option of all may be the second-tier\u2014not second-rate\u2014colleges, like Reed, Kenyon, Wesleyan, Sewanee, Mount Holyoke, and others. Instead of trying to compete with Harvard and Yale, these schools have retained their allegiance to real educational values.\n\nNot being an entitled little shit is an admirable goal. But in the end, the deeper issue is the situation that makes it so hard to be anything else. The time has come, not simply to reform that system top to bottom, but to plot our exit to another kind of society altogether.\n\nThe education system has to act to mitigate the class system, not reproduce it. Affirmative action should be based on class instead of race, a change that many have been advocating for years. Preferences for legacies and athletes ought to be discarded. SAT scores should be weighted to account for socioeconomic factors. Colleges should put an end to r\u00e9sum\u00e9-stuffing by imposing a limit on the number of extracurriculars that kids can list on their applications. They ought to place more value on the kind of service jobs that lower-income students often take in high school and that high achievers almost never do. They should refuse to be impressed by any opportunity that was enabled by parental wealth. Of course, they have to stop cooperating with U.S. News.\n\nMore broadly, they need to rethink their conception of merit. If schools are going to train a better class of leaders than the ones we have today, they\u2019re going to have to ask themselves what kinds of qualities they need to promote. Selecting students by GPA or the number of extracurriculars more often benefits the faithful drudge than the original mind.\n\nThe changes must go deeper, though, than reforming the admissions process. That might address the problem of mediocrity, but it won\u2019t address the greater one of inequality. The problem is the Ivy League itself. We have contracted the training of our leadership class to a set of private institutions. However much they claim to act for the common good, they will always place their interests first. The arrangement is great for the schools, but is Harvard\u2019s desire for alumni donations a sufficient reason to perpetuate the class system?\n\nI used to think that we needed to create a world where every child had an equal chance to get to the Ivy League. I\u2019ve come to see that what we really need is to create one where you don\u2019t have to go to the Ivy League, or any private college, to get a first-rate education.\n\nHigh-quality public education, financed with public money, for the benefit of all: the exact commitment that drove the growth of public higher education in the postwar years. Everybody gets an equal chance to go as far as their hard work and talent will take them\u2014you know, the American dream. Everyone who wants it gets to have the kind of mind-expanding, soul-enriching experience that a liberal arts education provides. We recognize that free, quality K\u201312 education is a right of citizenship. We also need to recognize\u2014as we once did and as many countries still do\u2014that the same is true of higher education. We have tried aristocracy. We have tried meritocracy. Now it\u2019s time to try democracy.\n\n"

    "text": "When I moved to New York, it was to Brooklyn, like a good millennial queer, in part in search of a sexual community I felt I was missing. But the job I\u2019d found was in Manhattan and I began to explore the city for signs of entry. It struck me as strange, as I walked from one bar in the West Village to another in the East, how the community I was seeking seemed only to exist in a few institutions between these few avenues, and from there had radiated across the world to call me to it. This was of course a ludicrous thing for me to believe\u2014for one thing, there were bars and parties all around my apartment. But as a newcomer, my orientation was toward Manhattan and I couldn\u2019t yet see the borough I had landed in as pertaining to the fantasy of my New York sexual self.\n\nWHEN BROOKLYN WAS QUEER: A HISTORY by Hugh Ryan St. Martin\u2019s Press, 320 pp., $29.99\n\nIt is this error that Hugh Ryan\u2019s new history attempts to correct. When Brooklyn Was Queer proceeds on the assumption that my mistake is widely shared. In his epilogue, he recounts how he also once assumed that Brooklyn had no history of queer community to speak of before the new millennium, when people like he and I (that is, the children of suburbanization) began to move there. But once he began to look for it, he discovered a rich past, from lesbian welders in the Navy Yard to queer culture in bathhouses and freak shows in Coney Island. His larger argument is that \u201cthe development of Brooklyn would track with the development of modern sexuality\u201d for roughly a century from 1855 to 1965, when the borough\u2019s postwar industrial decline and urban renewal would also bury these communities. The unique experience of queer communities in Brooklyn during this time, he argues, formed the prehistory to the modern gay liberation movement and its signal event, the Stonewall riots. It\u2019s a satisfying retort to the idea that there was nothing queer there before.\n\nA hungry archivist, Hugh Ryan unearths vivid material to populate this story. Taking the Brooklyn Heights publication of Walt Whitman\u2019s Leaves of Grass as a starting point\u2014sure, why not?\u2014he depicts early queer lives around the city\u2019s waterfront, from the neighborhoods of Red Hook to the Navy Yard. Brooklyn Heights and the city\u2019s \u201cpulsing heart,\u201d Fulton Ferry landing, are consecrated in verse by a poem of Whitman\u2019s, which, Ryan ventures, might contain the first description of cruising in American literature. \u201cBrooklyn\u2019s waterfront offered the density, privacy, diversity, and economic possibility that would allow queer people to find each other in ever-increasing numbers,\u201d he writes, echoing John D\u2019Emilio\u2019s argument that the emergence of sexual identity reflected the economic transition from family-centered household production to a society where people depended on a wage to support themselves. One result of this was the birth of communities of sexual interest in cities, and port cities like Brooklyn above all.\n\nWhitman kept a daybook listing the working-class men he made sexual advances toward, a record of the cruising spots and practices of 1860s Brooklyn:"

    "text": "Would House Democrats censure one of their own for daring to suggest that the deep-pocketed fossil fuel lobby buys influence in Congress? What about a member who said the same about Big Pharma? And yet, Democratic leaders on Wednesday were on the cusp of implicitly rebuking U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar for criticizing the pro-Israel lobby\u2019s power. \u201cI want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is okay for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country,\u201d she said a recent event.\n\nThis was destined to be another example of the impossibility in Washington of deviating from unflinching support of Israel\u2019s policies. But then something remarkable happened. The Democrats\u2019 resolution against anti-Semitism was tabled after an outcry from members who felt Omar, a Muslim woman of color, was being singled out and that the party should condemn the full spectrum of religious bigotry, including the Islamophobia practiced by President Trump. A powerful lobby tried to suppress criticism of its work, and rank-and-file Democrats spoke their minds.\n\nOmar\u2019s latest comments were not the freshman congresswoman\u2019s first this year to draw accusations of anti-Semitism. Earlier this month, she tweeted that support in Congress for Israel was \u201call about the Benjamins baby,\u201d referring to $100 bills. She later apologized for the tweet, even though it referred to a time-honored practice in Washington. Pro-Israel supporters have gained influence through hefty political spending, just as Big Oil and Big Finance and Big Tech have. There\u2019s nothing particularly novel about that fact.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about the sums we\u2019re talking about. When considering single-issue lobbying, \u201cpro-Israel\u201d is the sixth-largest topic in Congress, larger than interest groups who lobby on abortion policy or gun control or women\u2019s issues. AIPAC, by far the largest of the pro-Israel groups, spent nearly $7 million on lobbying in 2017 and 2018 combined. Outside of lobbying, AIPAC rallies its members to assist in political campaigns of like-minded candidates. Fundraising pitches are routinely made in side rooms at AIPAC\u2019s 20,000-person strong policy conference."

    "text": "Republicans on the committee weren\u2019t particularly interested in any of that, aside from lone dissenter Representative Scot Turner, who decried the GOP\u2019s support for \u201cwasting $150 million.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would not have mattered if we\u2019d shown up with two stone tablets in the House, decreeing that the Lord wanted paper ballots,\u201d said Marilyn Marks, head of the Coalition for Good Governance, a leading proponent of paper balloting. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have heard.\u201d\n\nWhy are Kemp and friends in such a hurry to spend so much unnecessary money? Both McClatchy and The New Yorker have provided some pretty juicy clues. Kemp\u2019s deputy chief of staff, former state Representative Chuck Harper, is a former lobbyist for ES&S, the odds-on favorite to win the Georgia contract if the $150 million is approved. Another, David Dove, was on the company\u2019s board of advisers, and thus had long been enjoying the perks that ES&S offers to elections officials around the country\u2014\u201cairfare on trips to places like Las Vegas and New York, upscale-hotel accommodations, and tickets to live events,\u201d as Sue Halpern wrote in The New Yorker. She later added a pertinent detail: \u201cIn March 2017, when [Dove] attended an ES&S junket in Las Vegas, Kemp\u2019s office was in the market to replace the state\u2019s entire inventory of voting machines.\u201d Dove was Secretary Kemp\u2019s chief of staff at the time; now he\u2019s Governor Kemp\u2019s executive counsel.\n\n\u201cPrevious work as a lobbyist is not a disqualifier for public service,\u201d Kemp\u2019s office told the Atlanta-Journal Constitution. \u201cPeople should not bend the facts to suit a narrative. Mr. Harper and Mr. Dove are men of integrity. They followed the law. They will continue to do so.\u201d\n\nBack when Georgia first fell for it, shortly after the Florida fiasco of 2000, electronic voting seemed like the wave of the future. But as cybersecurity threats have metastasized in recent cycles, most states and localities have retired the machines (except for voters unable to mark paper ballots) and gone back to plain old reliable, recountable paper. Not Georgia, though. Or key battleground areas like Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Johnson County, Kansas; and Franklin County, Ohio. All of them have recently purchased ballot-marking machines.\n\nGiven the heightened awareness of election-security threats after 2016, it might seem downright odd that anybody is forking out the money for these machines. But some local elections officials say they prefer them\u2014sometimes because they\u2019ve been wined-and-dined by the vendors (as 18 county elections officials in Pennsylvania were recently outed as doing), sometimes because they think the touchscreen machines will make things easier. Paper ballots have to be printed and distributed, after all, then audited and counted. With ES&S\u2019s ExpressVote, the county may have to buy expensive, specialized paper for the machines, but on Election Day, that paper is sent off into electronic purgatory via the machines. No muss, no fuss, no clean-up for elections workers. Also, no verifiability.\n\nThe touchscreen manufacturers also claim that their machines make voting go faster, resulting in shorter waits to cast a ballot\u2014and fewer voters who give up and leave without voting. In fact, the opposite has proven true. In the only state to use ballot-marking devices en masse in 2018, Maryland, county officials reported that lines were longer than ever, especially during peak voting hours. The reason is pretty obvious: Lots of people can fill out their hand ballots at the same time, as opposed to waiting to use the limited number of machines available.\n\nAnd unlike filling in bubbles on a sheet of paper, ExpressVote is anything but intuitive to use, as this demonstration video from Johnson County, Kansas\u2014a real treat for fans of 1950s instructional films!\u2014makes clumsily clear:\n\nThe multiple steps required of a voter and machine attendant take six minutes just to explain.\n\nFair-elections activists, cybersecurity folks, and regular citizens in Georgia\u2014the ones who\u2019ve caught on to what\u2019s happening, that is\u2014are appropriately outraged by the idea of spending so much money for vulnerable technology. The group Stacey Abrams founded after the midterms, Fair Fight Action, has run TV and radio ads to stir up opposition. \u201cThose faulty machines\u2014the ones that could get hacked to steal our vote\u2014Governor Kemp wants to spend $150 million of our taxpayer dollars to buy more,\u201d says the TV ad, which mentions that Kemp hired ES&S\u2019s former lobbyist.\n\nBut the governor and his allies are betting that they can get the bill through the legislature before it becomes a political albatross. To grease the wheels, Kemp\u2019s successor as secretary of state, former GOP House member Brad Raffensperger, has been spreading disinformation. To combat the reporting about the excessive cost of the touchscreen machines, his office produced an analysis of what it\u2019ll cost to use paper ballots over the next decade\u2014$244 million, it claims.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s an apples-and-oranges comparison\u2014an initial cost versus a 10-year cost\u2014and activists say that Raffensperger inflated the cost of paper and the amount of paper that would be required for hand-balloting. Two conservative groups, the National Election Defense Coalition and FreedomWorks, called the voting-machine deal a \u201cboondoggle\u201d in a letter last week to state Senate Republicans. \u201cThe Secretary of State is circulating a cost analysis that is profoundly misleading and wildly inflates the costs of conducting elections with hand-marked paper ballots,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe Secretary\u2019s analysis is like comparing the cost of buying a Chevrolet \u2014 plus insurance, gas and repairs for ten years \u2014 to the cost of \u2026 buying a Bentley and then trying to insist the Bentley is cheaper.\u201d\n\nInterviewed last week by Georgia Public Broadcasting, Raffensperger shrugged off the naysayers, saying, \u201cthere\u2019s always going to be people who want to pick a fight.\u201d He chalked up any opposition to partisan politics and outside agitators: \u201cI guess the national Democrats and national liberal organizations want hand-marked paper ballots; they don\u2019t get that, then they\u2019re going to stomp their feet.\u201d\n\nOutside Georgia, conservatives tend to be anything but gung-ho about electronic voting methods. One of Congress\u2019s leading advocates for paper ballots is none other than Freedom Caucus chair Mark Meadows, who floated the Paper Act last year, which would have offered financial incentives to states and municipalities who set aside their machines for paper ballots. Anti-tax guru Grover Norquist and former Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff wrote a widely circulated op-ed supporting paper ballots as the best defense against cybersecurity threats.\n\nMost of the country\u2019s elections officials are listening. But in Georgia, the lobbying efforts of voting-machine vendors appear to be paying off in spectacular fashion. Unless Congress forces everyone to use paper ballots\u2014which Republicans don\u2019t like, because it would smack of a \u201cfederal mandate\u201d and weaken local control of elections\u2014it\u2019s likely that Georgia, just as it becomes a battleground state, will end up with election results that can\u2019t be trusted in 2020 and beyond. There was only one way to make Georgia\u2019s bad elections worse. And Brian Kemp and his cronies, by God, have found it."

    "text": "The seven Labour MPs who resigned from the party on February 18 cited anti-Semitism within the Labour party and a lack of trust in leader Jeremy Corbyn, especially when it comes to handling Brexit, as their reasons for leaving. An eighth Labour MP joined the following day. A few days later, three Conservative MPs made their own break, citing the hijacking of the Conservative party by hard-right elements, Theresa May\u2019s failure to modernize the party, and the reckless handling of Brexit.\n\nSmall, narrowly focused parties have a history of successful issue advocacy, if not necessarily long-term parliamentary success. Beyond UKIP\u2019s role in the Brexit vote there is the example of Germany\u2019s Green party, which though founded as an irreverent activist party, went on to gain parliamentary representation, exerting tremendous sway on politics in the 1980s: The Greens are currently absorbing voters from the decaying center-left and center-right governing parties. The Dutch Party for the Animals, PvdP, even with limited parliamentary representation, has also been able to guide the animal welfare policies of mainstream parties, given its ability to absorb voters from both sides of the political spectrum.\n\nWhether The Independent Group can do something similar is debatable. The group\u2019s statement promises \u201cevidence-based\u201d policies that reach beyond traditional divisions in pursuit of the national interest. A list of similarly anodyne declarations follows. \u201cThe barriers of poverty, prejudice and discrimination facing individuals should be removed and advancement occur on the basis of merit,\u201d one proclamation begins. One would be hard-pressed to find MPs from any party that disagree.\n\nA certain vagueness is perhaps to be expected from a group composed of both center-left and center-right politicians. And perhaps there is a gap in the U.K.\u2019s political market for such a centrist party. A familiar narrative since the 2016 referendum has been that both main parties, Labour and the Conservatives, have been drifting to the wings, leaving a large portion of the electorate feeling unrepresented and without a viable alternative. Others feel poorly represented due to the fact that, even though 48 percent of the electorate voted to Remain in the EU, both major parties have committed to Brexit. The Liberal Democrats, who would have been the obvious go-to middle-ground, pro-EU party, have been unattractive to center-left voters, their brand seriously damaged in the years it governed in coalition with the Conservatives, enabling austerity measures and the tripling of university fees. Center-right voters have also been reluctant to cast their vote to the Liberal Democrats, for fear of aiding Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s ascent to power, given how close the race between Labour and the Conservatives is in many districts, and the UK\u2019s \u201cfirst past the post\u201d electoral system.\n\nThe prospect of a new center party has surfaced before, particularly in the spring of 2018, when a fund of \u00a350 million was said to have been raised by entrepreneurs, and philanthropists with the aim to \u201cbreak the Westminster mould.\u201d Those plans never materialized, but TIG now seems like the product of similar machinations. Some have argued this could be Britain\u2019s Macron moment, referring to the rise of Emanuel Macron in France, where a group of political entrepreneurs created a new force that quickly won support. (TIG is already polling at 14 to 18 percent.) Others, however, see the group as the dying whimpers of centrist politics that\u2019s had its day. After all, the U.K. already had its Macron: His name was Tony Blair."

Obama\u2019s first attorney general announced on Monday that he had decided against a bid, saying he would instead focus on leading the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a Democratic-aligned group that aims to curb GOP gerrymandering when the states redraw legislative maps after the 2020 census.\n\n\u201cI will do everything I can to ensure that the next Democratic president is not hobbled by a House of Representatives pulled to the extremes by members from gerrymandered districts,\u201d he wrote in a Washington Post op-ed announcing his decision. This is familiar ground for Holder. He warned in this magazine last February that the Trump administration\u2019s proposed citizenship question on the census \u201cwould have devastating consequences on the right to vote and to participate meaningfully in democracy,\u201d and he often calls for the Electoral College\u2019s abolition.\n\nFor the past 20 years, Republicans have exploited structural flaws in American democracy to amass disproportionate political power in Washington. The challenge for Democrats is how to reform that system to achieve their goals. While winning the presidency is an important step in that process, Holder\u2019s decision shows how some of the presidential candidates could better advance a liberal policy agenda by staying out of the 2020 race.\n\nThe current crop of Democratic candidates seems to understand this, to varying degrees. Some have said they will support statehood for the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, which would give representation in Congress to almost four million Americans and dilute the influence of conservative rural states. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren built her campaign around the theme of anti-corruption and proposed a wide-ranging legislative package to undermine special interests\u2019 grip on Washington. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s central theme is how extreme wealth inequality has warped the American democratic process.

    "text": "Dragan Umi\u010devi\u0107, a volunteer who was prosecuted in Croatia this past year for allegedly helping a family illegally cross into the country from Serbia, saw this shift happen in real time. Umi\u010devi\u0107 lives near the Serbian border; in 2015, thousands of asylum seekers began to move through the area, tracing a path north that became known as the \u201cBalkan Route.\u201d In response, Umi\u010devi\u0107 and his friends began bringing food and blankets.\n\nTrafficking charges against aid workers have become so commonplace that they are now used as threats.\n\nFor a brief moment, the EU responded to the situation as a humanitarian crisis. \u201cThe political situation was to help people,\u201d Umi\u010devi\u0107 told me. \u201cNow it\u2019s gone in the direction of these people aren\u2019t welcome anymore.\u201d In March 2016, Umi\u010devi\u0107 watched as tens of thousands of asylum seekers on the Balkan Route were stopped in their tracks overnight.\n\nSince then, criminal prosecution of humanitarian aid workers has proliferated. \u201cThe EU and its institutions, particularly the European Commission and Frontex, and the member states, have presented their actions as a battle against the \u2018traffickers\u2019 who profit from the refugees\u2019 plight,\u201d Frances Webber, the vice chair of the Institute of Race Relations and a former barrister who\u2019s done extensive work on solidarity criminalization, told me over email. The irony, she pointed out, is that closed and militarized borders have actually created a greater demand for traffickers, opening vulnerable asylum seekers up to financial and sexual exploitation. And because of the 2002 facilitation directive, people associated with border crossers for humanitarian reasons become tarred with the same brush as the traffickers.\n\nOne of the first high-profile cases of such prosecution occurred on Lesvos in January 2016, when five foreign volunteers were charged with human trafficking after responding to a routine distress call at sea. As with Mardini and Binder, the defendants had cooperated regularly with the Greek authorities on search-and-rescue missions. Since then, everyone from 24 crew members of the rescue boat Aquarius to the editor-in-chief of the Belgian Marie Claire has been charged with human trafficking, prosecuted for actions ranging from rescuing people at sea to briefly housing them and purchasing them cellphones.\n\nMigrant families, helped by volunteers, on the coast of Lesvos in 2015. Bulent Kilic/AFP/Getty Images\n\nNational laws on trafficking vary widely from member state to member state and are patchily and even disingenuously enforced, as Webber wrote in a 2017 briefing on the subject. Though the case against Umi\u010devi\u0107, for example, fell apart in court\u2014GPS data showed that the family he stood accused of spiriting across the border was already in Croatia by the time they made contact with him\u2014he was still convicted of \u201cunconscious negligence\u201d and tagged with an 8000 euro fine.\n\nIf Umi\u010devi\u0107 had been convicted of helping the migrants cross, he would have faced far harsher consequences: Croatian law makes no distinction between humanitarian assistance and illegal aid. Only eight member states include exceptions for humanitarian intervention (or specific types of humanitarian intervention: providing food, but not transport, for example) in their national anti-trafficking laws. But that doesn\u2019t mean these exemptions are honored in practice. In Greece, a law governing facilitation of illegal entry exempts sea rescue\u2014but Greek authorities claimed the volunteers in the 2016 Lesvos case were found in international waters, implying that they had been running refugees between Turkey and Greece. In Mardini and Binder\u2019s case, the police\u2019s theory of a vast smuggling conspiracy likewise aimed to preclude a defense of humanitarian rescue.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know for sure whether the overzealous prosecution of aid workers is merely a byproduct of closed borders or a coherent strategy of deterrence\u2014for one thing, prosecutors would never admit to an EU-wide plot to deliberately target pro-refugee civilians. What seems fairly undeniable is that EU member states have taken full advantage of the 2002 directive\u2019s \u201chigh degree of legislative ambiguity,\u201d as a 2016 European Parliament study put it. Trafficking charges against aid workers have become so commonplace that they are now used as threats: In February, the unabashedly xenophobic Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini tried to intimidate the British crew of rescue ship Sea-Watch 3 with the possibility of an investigation into human trafficking charges for their actions in rescuing 47 migrants in the Mediterranean.\n\nHarassment of humanitarians also sometimes seems to exceed what a state might find practical for another crime. Human rights activist Helena Maleno Garz\u00f3n has been observing migrant and border militarization issues in Spain\u2019s Moroccan enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta for years. The government, she told me, regards people like her as \u201cunwelcome witnesses\u201d to police abuse and security contracts with Spanish companies with questionable human rights records.\n\nMaleno has spent much of her career trying to draw attention to the persecution that human rights defenders around the world face. In 2012, she discovered she herself was under investigation by the Spanish government. But, unable to find enough incriminating evidence on Maleno to prosecute her in Spanish courts, the police eventually handed over their intelligence to Moroccan authorities, according to Maleno and her lawyers. In early 2018, she was hauled into court in Tangier, accused of people smuggling for her work receiving distress calls from migrants at sea and passing them on to maritime rescue operations. A year later, she\u2019s still waiting for the judge\u2019s decision.\n\nStill, more often than not, courts around the EU seem to recognize the instinctive distinction between trafficking and humanitarian aid, despite prosecutors\u2019 efforts. In May this past year, the 2016 Lesvos smuggling case was finally resolved when the defendants were cleared of all charges in Greek court. And in December, the conviction of C\u00e9dric Herrou was overturned by France\u2019s highest court. The decision to send Herrou\u2019s case back to the Lyon court of appeals for reconsideration was based on by a ruling several months earlier that those who facilitate illegal entry into the country without being compensated for it should be immune from the usual penalties, under the French principle of fraternit\u00e9.\n\nBut the fact that these cases aren\u2019t holding up in court hasn\u2019t deterred authorities from continuing to mount them, or attempting to see them through to the bitter end. Webber finds it \u201castonishing\u201d that charges were brought against Mardini, Karakitsos, and Binder in the first place, given the five Lesvos defendants\u2019 acquittal. Though that case has now all but collapsed, a trial will most likely still take place\u2014\u201cit would be unprecedented\u201d to drop it entirely, Binder told me. Maleno\u2019s investigation, which she has described as a \u201csword of Damocles\u201d hanging over her head, remains open, and Umi\u010devi\u0107 is currently mired in an appeals process.\n\nThese prosecutions generally don\u2019t lock people up for the rest of their lives, and they don\u2019t seem to affect the desire of migrants to seek asylum in Europe. But they do act as a pretty effective deterrent when it comes to aid work. Binder\u2019s lawyer recently told press that \u201chundreds of volunteers have been discouraged, and on Lesvos many have left.\u201d Since ERCI was forced to suspend its operations, there are no more formal search-and-rescue organizations active on Lesvos\u2019s southern shore. The forced confinement to port of a number of rescue ships means that untold numbers of people have drowned in the Mediterranean.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re confronted with this type of criminalization, it has a really big impact on your life,\u201d Maleno told me. \u201cYou need to take security precautions\u2014I have to evaluate the risk to my family, to my children. It also has an impact on work. I can\u2019t do my investigatory work with the freedom I had before.\u201d\n\nThis article originally misstated the number of people prosecuted in 2018 for assisting border crossers as \u201cat least 99,\u201d rather than 89. We regret the error."

    "text": "Omar went on to ask why she was permitted to speak about other powerful lobbies\u2014the NRA, fossil fuel industries, pharmaceutical companies\u2014and not about Israel, but that bit would not be quoted in the storm of coverage that followed her remarks. All attention went to just five words: \u201callegiance to a foreign country.\u201d Never mind that Omar was talking about politicians, and not about Jews at all: Congressman Eliot Engel had released a statement before the week was out, accusing Omar of \u201cinvoking a vile anti-Semitic slur.\u201d The pundits soon jumped in. On Monday, New York Times columnist and former Jerusalem Post editor-in-chief Bret Stephens, who had elsewhere called anti-Semitism \u201ca disease of the Arab mind,\u201d took to Twitter to charge Omar with \u201cclassic anti-Semitism.\u201d Jeff Ballabon, a former Trump campaign adviser, lobbyist, and fund-raiser for far-right Israeli settlers, went a step further, calling the Congresswoman \u201cfilth\u201d on Fox Business Network.\n\nOver the weekend, leading Democrats met in what the New York Times characterized as a \u201cfrenzied effort to respond to Ms. Omar.\u201d By Monday night, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had circulated a draft resolution condemning anti-Semitism. It did not mention Omar\u2014or the Islamophobic smears she had faced the previous week\u2014but its target was clear. The draft mentioned actual, and terrifying, instances of anti-Semitism, including Robert Bowers\u2019s murder of 11 Jews at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh last October, but nearly a fourth of its length was devoted to \u201cthe myth of dual loyalty.\u201d It even cited Dreyfus, misspelling his name.\n\nOmar, however, was not actually hauling out the old dual loyalty trope. Rather, the Minnesota representative was questioning a situation in which American politicians, the overwhelming majority of whom are not Jewish, have for years with near-unanimity fought to quash all public criticism of an actual foreign country. No fewer than 26 states have passed legislation punishing businesses and individuals who, to protest Israeli policies toward Palestinians, support the movement for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions. Some require anyone who wishes to do business with the state to sign an oath declaring that they do not boycott Israel. Others create official blacklists of BDS supporters. The U.S. Senate\u2019s first legislative priority in January, after a five-week government shutdown, was to pass a bill authored by Marco Rubio that gave a federal blessing to state and local anti-boycott laws. Predictably, when Rashida Tlaib spoke out against it, tweeting that the Senate bill\u2019s backers \u201cforgot what country they represent,\u201d Rubio slammed her for taking \u201ca typical anti-Semitic line.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-Semitism is all too real. Criticizing Israel is not anti-Semitism. Nor is calling out politicians who are more interested in shielding Israel from embarrassment than in protecting the constitutional rights of their own constituents. So far, the Democratic establishments\u2019 attempts to chastise Omar have only made her point more strongly. On Monday, Representative Juan Vargas condemned her on Twitter for perpetuating \u201churtful anti-Semitic stereotypes,\u201d adding that \u201cquestioning support for the U.S.-Israel relationship is unacceptable.\u201d The language was strikingly similar to that Democratic congressman Eliot Engel used last fall, when he suggested that Omar, Tlaib, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, all of whom had spoken up for Palestinian rights, \u201cneed to be educated\u201d about Israel. \u201cWe have overwhelming support for Israel in the Congress,\u201d he said, \u201cand \u2026 it will continue that way.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, blatant appeals to anti-Jewish conspiracy theories by Republican politicians who do support Israel have received no such condemnation. (The president has, famously, even retweeted neo-Nazis.) The contrast makes what we saw this last week look less like an attempt to deal honestly with anti-Semitism than an opportunistic assault on a black woman in a hijab who had the effrontery to speak out of turn. President Trump got his jabs in on Saturday: \u201cWe have people in Congress that hate our country,\u201d he said, before implying that these people were immigrants. Given that Omar is one of only 14 immigrant members of Congress, and Trump then called her out by name in a tweet two days later, the allusion was none too subtle. None of the Congress members who have accused Omar of anti-Semitism has voiced a word criticizing the president for such dog-whistle xenophobia."

      "Ken Silverstein"
    ],
    "text": "If sanctions fail to cause regime change, Step Two is to coerce or bribe military officers to overthrow the regime. That failed in Iraq and has thus far failed in Venezuela. Last fall, Trump\u2019s administration \u201cheld secret meetings with rebellious military officers from Venezuela to discuss their plans to overthrow President Maduro,\u201d the New York Times reported.\n\nSimultaneously, the administration began openly calling for Maduro\u2019s ouster. Last November, Bolton spoke at Freedom Tower, a building where anti-Castro Cubans were welcomed in 1960 after Castro\u2019s revolution toppled dictator Fulgencio Batista. \u201cThe troika of tyranny in this hemisphere\u2014Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua\u2014has finally met its match,\u201d he declared. He referred to the leaders of that trio of countries as \u201cclowns\u201d who were \u201cakin to Larry, Curly and Moe\u201d of the Three Stooges, and demanded they step aside or the U.S. would remove them from power.\n\nWe are now at about the stage in Venezuela where, in the Iraq case, the Bush administration invaded. Just weeks ago, the Trump administration announced it would recall all of its diplomats from Caracas and the Maduro government, in retaliation, shut down its Washington embassy and brought its personnel home. Trump has recognized as president the leader of the National Assembly, Juan Guaid\u00f3, a former electronics peddler with largely foreign support and now busy rattling sabers and promising that Maduro\u2019s days are numbered.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what exactly comes next. Will the U.S. invade? As insane as that sounds, we are dealing with Trump. What about a U.S.-prompted military coup? Or will the CIA once again try to kill Maduro, as it tried to kill Saddam Hussein, Fidel Castro, and a host of other \u201cenemies\u201d?\n\nProphecy is always dangerous. But here\u2019s why I would bet on Maduro.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that brutal U.S. economic sanctions, in addition to Maduro\u2019s own corrupt and repressive policies, have created a lot of misery and discontent. People are tired and believe, understandably, that the United States will continue to starve the country\u2014and them\u2014until Maduro is gone.\n\nLast week, brought to Caracas by the International Peoples\u2019 Assembly, an anti-interventionist Latin American group holding a conference, I wandered away from the official events to walk through the impoverished barrios. \u201cI want a coup,\u201d said one young woman I spoke to, who works in the hospitality industry. \u201cI am fed up.\u201d She was the only person I met who openly supported a coup, and said so with no apparent fear of political consequences. (I walked around Caracas, day and night, openly stating my politics\u2014no one, from the government nor the opposition, harassed me or was angered by me sharing my opinions.)\n\nBut while Maduro could hardly be called well-liked, Guaid\u00f3 and the U.S.-dominated opposition are widely reviled and rejected. Very few Venezuelans want to go back to 1989, when the army killed so many protestors, or to 1998, the year before Chavez was elected. Those who do are often members of the wealthy old order. Fittingly, one of the main opposition points is George Washington Plaza, a rich neighborhood sandwiched between the barrios of El Paraiso and La Vega.\n\nAnd while American politicians favoring intervention often point to U.S. media reports of widespread shortages and even starvation, what I saw when walking through the city was a different story.\n\nI met Viviana at a union meeting in El Paraiso, and we walked to her home about two kilometers away afterward. William, who was also at the union meeting, joined us. During the walk, I saw plenty of food. It may be expensive, but poor people can buy it\u2014coffee, sugar, chicken, bread, a dazzling assortment of fruit, among other things\u2014from street vendors and at street markets.\n\nCertain things are indeed prohibitively costly: As we walked to Viviana\u2019s house, I looked for someone on the street smoking a cigarette so I could bum a light. To my surprise, I couldn\u2019t find anyone for 20 minutes. \u201cCigarettes are too expensive,\u201d Viviana explained. \u201cNo one can afford to smoke anymore.\n\nViviana and William, however, then went on to feed me a delicious dinner of blood sausage, Pasta Bolognese and rice and chicken liver\u2014all items Viviana had on hand in her house in the low-income barrio of La Vega. At the entrance to the neighborhood, people were lined up waiting for buses and moto taxis. Even more than most barrios I visited, La Vega is overwhelmingly Chavista, featuring wall murals of former president Chavez, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, El Libertador, Che Guevara, and other revolutionary Latin American leaders.\n\nI visited a number of other barrios and didn\u2019t have time to stop for a meal, although I was invited. In San August\u00edn\u2014central Caracas\u2014I met a woman, who preferred to be anonymous, who showed me her home high up the mountainside. The view from her window included a luxury apartment building. Most of the units were sitting empty, she told me, because the owners had fled to Miami, Orlando, Madrid, Lisbon, and elsewhere abroad.\n\nI also met Iris, Navidad, and Pedro, who I became quite friendly with. We drank beer and smoked cigarettes, and they allowed me to take their photographs. We didn\u2019t discuss politics much, but it was apparent they didn\u2019t like Guaid\u00f3 or the opposition. They also clearly were not going hungry and looked well fed and happy.\n\nAnother reason I believe a coup won\u2019t work is because the U.S. has not been able to put together a bogus coalition to mount an invasion, as it did in Iraq in 2003. Both the Brazilian and Colombian governments have publicly declared they will not participate in an armed foray into Venezuela.\n\nNor have the Trump administration\u2019s overtures to the Venezuelan military been effective. Thus far, the inner circle around the president appears to be holding tight. And why would they defect to the Yankees? It\u2019s a huge risk, given that if the coup fails you\u2019re likely to be arrested: A house in Miami or an offshore Delaware bank account won\u2019t do you a lot of good in a prison cell.\n\nMaduro keeps a close eye on the military. Or more specifically, Diosdado Cabello keeps a close eye on the military, and everything else in Venezuela. Cabello is the most powerful person in Venezuela and the power behind Maduro\u2019s throne. A military official, he and Chavez were close at least since the failed 1992 coup attempt against CAP. I was told by multiple sources that Chavez picked the hapless Maduro to be vice president only because he was wary of having the cagey, brilliant Cabello as second-in-command.\n\nThe Trump administration can keep trying to induce or threaten Venezuelan military officers to depose Maduro, but good luck. Such traitors\u2014and let\u2019s face it, it is treason in any country to take up arms against your own government in exchange for cash and/or promises of career advancement from a foreign power\u2014would almost surely be caught and dealt with harshly.\n\nThat leaves a U.S. invasion as the only practical option to get rid of Maduro. Sure, Bolton, Abrams, Rubio, and other right-wing politicians\u2014some like Rubio who receive lavish campaign contributions from pro-coup interests\u2014are all for war, but they\u2019re not going to die fighting in the streets of Caracas. Well-placed sources have told me that a majority of senior Pentagon and intelligence officials oppose a U.S. invasion, recognizing that it would be folly.\n\nCuriously, American oil companies with interests in Venezuela, such as ExxonMobil and Chevron, have not said much publicly about Trump\u2019s attempt to overthrow Maduro. Hopefully that\u2019s because they know\u2014as the president should\u2014that war is bad for business. The oil companies do have a fortune at stake in Venezuela, however, and could ultimately decide they\u2019ll make more with Maduro out of the way.\n\nIf history is any guide, it will take an outside power\u2014the United States\u2014to provoke a war. That\u2019s the clear aim of Rubio, but he\u2019s becoming increasingly erratic and desperate as he flails around trying to trigger a conflagration, even tweeting a bloody image of former Libya ruler Muammar Gaddafi as he demands Maduro to step down.\n\nMaduro may be corrupt, authoritarian, bombastic, and unstable\u2014qualities he shares with the American president fixated on deposing him. He may even have found ways to inflate his numbers in the 2018 election. But for the time being, he remains his country\u2019s sitting president. Trump and his interventionist advisers are unlikely to change that\u2014and they\u2019d probably do better not to try.\n\nThis article has been updated to clarify Diosdado Cabello\u2019s position in the government in 2002 and ExxonMobil\u2019s current relationship with Venezuela."

    "text": "So, Hopper introduces us, with utmost tenderness, to the necessary loves of her life. She describes in \u201cMoby-Dick\u201d how, overwhelmed by the dizzying prospect of selecting a sperm donor, she delegated the task to two trusted friends (although she maintained veto power). In \u201cDear Octopus,\u201d she considers the long and spiny history she shares with her staunchly Christian brother, formerly a co-conspirator and partner in philosophical debate, from whom she has untangled herself because his stringent views are incompatible with her own. In the same essay, she looks at her relationships with her sisters\u2014tight, somatic, and sometimes discordant bonds, so unlike the bonds of mutual encouragement and honest compassion she shares with friends as an adult.\n\nThese, according to one of Hopper\u2019s sisters, are her \u201clove circles,\u201d a derisive name for what she considers \u201cthe uncritical and frictionless mode of conversation practiced by most of my friends.\u201d Although Hopper plainly states that she cannot dwell among her family of origin, she resists comparing the level of their affection for her to that of her found families. Difficult love, the sort that, in the context of her siblings, Hopper describes as both \u201cconsoling and intolerable,\u201d might demand more temperate frequencies; it might even send us reeling, battle scars sketched across our skin. Yet it is not necessarily less important than our more soothing relationships\u2014and we might need it all the same.\n\nDifficult love might send us reeling, battle scars sketched across our skin. Yet we might need it all the same.\n\nFor there are many ways to lean and to love, Hopper explains. We grow acquainted with her friend Ashley Makar, whom Hopper met at Yale Divinity School and who, over the years, has become a writerly collaborator and beloved friend. In \u201cYoung Adult Cancer Story,\u201d Hopper chronicles the experience of reading John Green\u2019s The Fault in Our Stars together with Ash and the other members of the \u201ccare team\u201d that joined ranks as Ash underwent treatment for stage four esophageal cancer. Young adult literature, Hopper observes, is especially suited to assuage the anguish of an inexorably vigorous illness, one that threatens to whittle away at a body until it yields. \u201c[What] young adult fiction can do when it works [is] open your veins or your tear ducts,\u201d she writes, \u201cand then staunch the flow with something in between what you want and what you have\u2014more drama but no answers; more love but no miracles.\u201d It is not curative, but as in the case of so much literature, it extends like a branch, graciously. It\u2019s another place to lean.\n\nAnd as we learn in \u201cCoasting,\u201d the responsibilities of caring for Ash, though welcome, were demanding, the anxieties strident and recurrent. In fact, Hopper notes that some were perplexed by her utter dedication to Ash. \u201cA few years ago,\u201d she writes, \u201cwhen I was rearranging my life to care for [Ash], an acquaintance of ours took me to task, telling me that certain kinds of care should be provided only by romantic partners, not by friends.\u201d But Hopper\u2019s worldview does not give credence to these blueprints of romantic convention; she advocates for a life that does not lessen certain attachments in order to uphold the primacy of others. \u201cHe may have been trying to protect me,\u201d she remarks of this acquaintance, \u201cbut in doing so he was enforcing a norm, and I didn\u2019t see why my friend should be deprived of care and I should be protected from the hard parts of love just because both of us happened to be single.\u201d On the contrary, we ought to love broadly and generously whenever we can, without parceling out our affections according to predetermined cultural rubrics.\n\nHard to Love\u2019s greatest accomplishment is its insistence upon the equality of platonic and non-matrimonial arrangements, not merely because it urges us to recalibrate our perception of kinship\u2014although this is important\u2014but because it disputes the capitalist logic that the institution of marriage so often serves to buttress. Hopper harpoons the archaic, yet sticky notion that marriage is the gold-standard for mutual reliance, our \u201conly socially sanctioned reprieve from the demand to self-rely.\u201d Why, she asks, shouldn\u2019t we care for a beloved individual who is connected to us not romantically but through friendship? We can grow too cozy in insularity, and can become blind to people around us who are in need.\n\nIt\u2019s harder to love this way, to draw once more on Hopper\u2019s title\u2014and to argue against the many poems and movies and novels that bemoan its aches and tortures, love should not always be easy. It should sprawl, and it should nudge us further than we\u2019d maybe prefer to go. We often cannot depend upon on our government and our mightiest institutions to safeguard citizens, and so we need spinster mentorship, and friends who double as cancer patient caretakers, and sperm donation selectors, and boisterous demonstrations outside the gates of the White House. Love must be willing, always willing, because it cannot be anything else."

    "text": "While soothing an ailing psyche with retail\u2014perhaps in lieu, or circumvention, of a profoundly dysfunctional health care system\u2014is quintessentially American, the consequences of our national anxiety don\u2019t stop at our wallets. In recent years our politics has become a politics of primal fear.\n\nIncendiary rhetoric promulgated by Fox News would have you believe that a human wave is washing up at our southern border in incomprehensible numbers, bringing disease and murder in its wake.\n\nFor more than a month, the functions of government ground to a partial halt over construction of a wall between the United States and its southern neighbors. The premise of the shutdown\u2014and the promise of the wall\u2014was that the United States was under imminent threat from migrants proceeding northward. Incendiary rhetoric promulgated by Fox News, its chief devotee the president, and sundry members of the Republican Party would have you believe that a human wave is washing up at our southern border in incomprehensible numbers, bringing disease and murder in its wake.\n\n\n\nThe midterm elections turned into a bitter contest over the threat represented by a column of migrants wending their way slowly northward. When some arrived at the border, they were tear-gassed en masse by a Border Patrol whose reinforcements included a deployment of thousands of U.S. soldiers, the largest deployment of troops during peacetime in a century. The much-vaunted wall, we are told, would keep these criminal disease-bearers away from American citizens. The wall was always central to the promise of the Trump presidency\u2014the idea that Mexicans are \u201cbringing crime\u201d was the premise of his campaign announcement in 2015\u2014and after two years of being stymied by Congress he has now declared a national emergency to build the wall unilaterally.\n\nAs inhabitants of a ludicrously well-defended empire, one that gobbles billions yearly for its stratospheric defense budgets, it\u2019s preposterous to imagine that dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of economic or situational migrants would pose a serious threat. Yet through the distorted lens of anxiety, where a single missed breath can feel like the onset of suffocation, even the smallest breach may seem catastrophic. So we imagine a communal bell jar, enclosing us all, an impenetrable but transparent border sealed off from the menace of human ruin.\n\nAnxiety disorder tends to fixate on specific objects: a shadow in a room; a loud noise in the street; the memory of a strained social interaction; the prospect of going outside. The migrant caravan was undoubtedly such a fixation, a specter from the south; the wall, its counterpart, a panacea better than a Xanax, a cure-all for the nation\u2019s many ills. The politics of stoking fear, then suggesting a militarized solution, isn\u2019t new, but it is playing out in its most lurid forms these days. If George W. Bush exploited post-9/11 fears about terrorism and WMDs to invade Iraq, Trump has conjured a threat out of a ragged group of some of the world\u2019s most desperate people. The state of the union, it seems, is scared as hell.\n\nBut not all fear is the distorted, excessive fear of anxiety disorder, beavering away over negligible or imagined ills. Some is the entirely justified fear of what is fearsome: struggle, deprivation, dying. In the APA study, people of color reported significantly higher anxiety than Caucasians, in an environment of rising, strident racism. Following an extended fight in the states and in Congress over America\u2019s tattered safety net, adults without health insurance reported a significantly higher overall stress level than those with insurance. The single largest area of increase in anxiety surrounded questions related to finances\u2014the fear of a bank balance driven into the red due to an illness or a layoff.\n\nAny attempt to rescue America from its deep-worn rut of fear must involve an attempt to address the conditions that give rise to that terror.\n\nGeneralized anxiety disorder, per the DSM-5, has a maddeningly self-contradictory list of symptoms: It gives rise to both restlessness and fatigue; both lapsed concentration and profound tension of the muscles. In this conflicted state, the mind and body team up to deprive the sufferer of sleep, and to induce irritability. Our body politic seems to suffer from a similar ailment: crouched defensively against threats real and imagined, yet unfocused by the endless distractions of the news cycle. We\u2019re restless for the next big story and fatigued of it already when it arrives. Sleepless and enraged, we pace through our days under the choleric guidance of a president whose only two emotions seem to be smugness and wrath.\n\nEight years after my initial diagnosis with a panic disorder, I have made a kind of fitful progress towards peace, managing my condition, more or less, with medication and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Lately, I have been working on mindfulness: the separation of troubled thoughts from self, the gathering of breath, the practicing of exercises meant to induce tranquility. It\u2019s slow, difficult work, shot through with setbacks, like a recent evening in which I became so convinced I would choke on a plate of dumplings that I threw them violently away from me, spilling ponzu sauce all over the floor. I wasn\u2019t killed by dumplings, and I quickly cleaned up the dark, sticky patch on my floor. I took a few deep breaths, and resolved to continue the work of trying to fix my broken psyche, piece by piece\u2014causes uncovered, wounds dressed, breathing ragged, then rhythmic.\n\nEmerging from the ludicrous and fearful dream of this era will be a long and painful process. Doing so won\u2019t be merely a matter of finding the right drug (or wall, or candidate, or party doctrine) to slow the nation\u2019s pulse. It\u2019s clear that comforting a troubled populace involves more than offering soothing words, or still worse, provocative, terror-fueled solutions to falsely magnified problems. Any attempt to rescue America from its deep-worn rut of fear must involve an attempt to address the conditions that give rise to that terror. The slow, unglamorous work of unknotting ourselves from fear is something we all have to work towards: through electoral politics, of course, and involvement in the great civic project of this nation.\n\nBut the anxious body is one prone to excess, spilling adrenaline thoughtlessly into overburdened veins. Fear is our ailment\u2014the grinding, weary work of insecurity, the grim, false fears of a racial invasion. Overcoming fear will require more than good policies and projects. It will require a new understanding of ourselves and our country, a kind of mindfulness about who we are, really, now that the swagger has gone. It will require addressing this nation\u2019s pathologies at the root: its failures, its crimes, its self-defeating myths. And it will require a measure of courage to break the heavy glass that seals us in, and breathe deeply in a cool new wind."

This is what Stalin dreamt about but never achieved.\"\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/t5amL02ABm \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 28, 2019\n\nLiberals largely have responded to these attacks with mockery. \u201cThe hamburger confiscation section of the Five Year Plan never got enough play from Stalin biographers,\u201d Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, quipped on Twitter about Gorka\u2019s speech. Parker Molloy, an editor-at-large at Media Matters for America, dubbed Gorka\u2019s comments over a video of McDonald\u2019s Hamburglar.\n\nI put Gorka's #CPAC rant about Democrats' non-existent plan to steal your hamburgers over an old McDonald's Hamburglar commercial. You're welcome. pic.twitter.com/cJnPTckY14 \u2014 Parker Molloy (@ParkerMolloy) February 28, 2019\n\nThere is nothing in the Green New Deal that suggests outlawing the meat industry, and Ocasio-Cortez didn\u2019t even say she wanted to take away hamburgers. \u201cShe said maybe you shouldn\u2019t eat burgers for breakfast, lunch and dinner,\u201d Trent noted. \u201cSo does everybody\u2019s doctor. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bold statement.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut the Green New Deal resolution does call for \u201cremoving ... greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is technologically feasible.\u201d Farming is responsible for about 9 percent of America\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions; almost half of that comes from animal agriculture. Two-thirds of the animal sector\u2019s emissions are from animal farts and burps\u2014and cows fart and burp the most, by far. This isn\u2019t just a problem in the U.S.: More than two-thirds of global emissions from the livestock industry are due to cows\u2014not just their farting and belching, but their endless eating. Cows consume immense amounts of grain, which requires a lot of fertilizer, which emits nitrous oxide, another powerful greenhouse gas.\n\nThis is why any comprehensive climate plan must take cows into account, with one obvious solution being to reduce their population. That doesn\u2019t mean taking away people\u2019s hamburgers, but it does mean making it a rarer, and thus more expensive, product. This is hardly the greatest sacrifice that will be required to prevent a civilizational catastrophe. But if the world\u2019s population simply reduced its meat and dairy consumption, scientists say the effect would be massive.\n\nThe gun debate serves as a cautionary tale for what might happen if Democrats don\u2019t embrace this reality. For years now, conservatives have accused Democrats of wanting to take Americans\u2019 guns away. Most Democrats propose no such thing, instead advocating for sensible gun policies such as expanded background checks and closing the gun-show loophole. But many Democrats do support a ban on assault weapons. As the most recent legislation from Senator Dianne Feinstein makes clear, that doesn\u2019t mean the government would take away assault weapons that Americans already own, but it would prevent them from buying more.\n\nThat idea is unacceptable to many gun owners, and more importantly to the National Rifle Association, which continues to peddle the claim that Democrats are trying to \u201ctake away\u201d guns. It\u2019s not true, but it\u2019s proven effective enough to prevent any meaningful gun-control legislation from becoming law over the past two decades\u2014even though a majority of Americans supports stricter gun laws.\n\n\n\nOnly 30 percent of Americans own a gun, while the percentage who eat hamburgers is surely higher: On average, Americans eat three per week. So the accusation that Democrats want to take away hamburgers could resonate with many more people than the claim that they want to take away guns. And the meat lobby has the resources to be vastly more influential in politics than the gun lobby. The gun industry estimates it contributes $51 billion to the economy per year; the meat industry estimates it contributes about $864 billion.\n\nIf there\u2019s anything more quintessentially American than guns, it\u2019s meat. As food historian Bruce Kraig told me, there exists a \u201cdeep American ideology in which abundant food, especially meat, suggests \u2018the promise of America,\u2019 the American cornucopia, and defines who we are as Americans.\u201d Conservatives are appealing to this sentiment with their attacks on the Green New Deal: Real Americans eat hamburgers.

    "text": "In February, Thomas also took aim at Americans\u2019 access to legal counsel under the Sixth Amendment. The case, Garza v. Idaho, involved an accused man who asked the Idaho courts to intervene after his lawyer refuse to file an appeal on his behalf. The lawyer declined because Gilberto Garza had waived his right to appeal during a plea bargain. In a 6-3 ruling, the justices said that the lawyer should have filed the appeal when his client requested it, even though the appeal itself was likely doomed. Thomas, joined by Alito and Gorsuch, wrote in dissent that Garza had waived his right to the appellate process itself during the plea bargain, so his lawyer had acted correctly by not filing anything. Then Thomas went even further.\n\nGideon v. Wainwright, the 1963 ruling that guarantees criminal defendants a lawyer even if they can\u2019t afford it, may be one of the court\u2019s most consequential rulings of the past half-century. It effectively forced states and the federal government to create the public-defender system to provide attorneys for defendants who could not afford one themselves. In a section joined only by Gorsuch, Thomas suggested that Gideon and the rest of the court\u2019s ineffective-counsel rulings since the 1960s should be reconsidered. Instead of reading the Sixth Amendment as guaranteeing legal counsel in all criminal matters, he said the Constitution\u2019s drafters only wanted to bar the government from forbidding a defendant from hiring a lawyer at all.\n\n\u201cIt is beyond our constitutionally prescribed role to make these policy choices ourselves,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEven if we adhere to this line of precedents, our dubious authority in this area should give us pause before we extend these precedents further.\u201d With public-defender systems already chronically underfunded, reversing Gideon could prompt some states to shutter them altogether.\n\nThough Thomas had shared this view before, this was the first time another justice had publicly signed on to them. In other areas, however, the court\u2019s conservative wing may be moving closer to his position. The justices heard oral arguments last week in American Legion v. American Humanist Association, a thorny religious-freedom case that centers on a four-story concrete Latin cross in the middle of a Maryland highway. Erected as a World War I memorial in 1925, the cross is owned and maintained by the state government. A group of local plaintiffs say that arrangement violates the First Amendment\u2019s Establishment Clause, which generally forbids Congress and the states from privileging one faith over another.\n\nIn the 1971 case Lemon v. Kurtzman, the Supreme Court set down a strict test for determining when the government\u2019s involvement in religious matters violates the Constitution. That test is often criticized by conservative legal scholars; the Supreme Court has also drifted away from it in the decades since it was handed down. As I noted last week, the plaintiffs proposed scrapping Lemon and adopting a test that could give the government far more leeway when entangling itself with religion. The justices seemed unwilling to go quite that far in oral arguments last week. But the Establishment Clause\u2019s status quo also seemed rocky. \u201cIs it time for this court to thank Lemon for its services and send it on its way?\u201d Gorsuch asked during oral arguments. Thomas, as is his usual practice, did not speak or ask questions.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Thomas and Gorsuch won\u2019t exactly be leading a counterrevolution right away. Justice Samuel Alito joined only one of Thomas\u2019s dissents\u2014in Garza, the Sixth Amendment case\u2014and explicitly refused to join the portion disavowing the 1960s precedents under fire. But he\u2019s made clear his views on the Warren era. In 1985, in a job application to the Reagan Justice Department, Alito wrote that his interest in constitutional law as a college student was \u201cmotivated in large part by disagreement with Warren Court decisions, particularly in the areas of criminal procedure, the Establishment Clause, and reapportionment.\u201d He seems to be a likely third vote in any majority opinion that chips away at a Warren-era precedent.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts has sided with the court\u2019s four liberals more frequently than usual this term, perhaps hoping to shore up the court\u2019s public legitimacy after the corrosive effects of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s partisan confirmation battle last fall. Kavanaugh himself has yet to make his impact fully felt on the court. In 2017, he delivered a glowing lecture on the jurisprudence of William Rehnquist, Roberts\u2019s predecessor as chief justice. Many legal scholars, Kavanaugh said, \u201cdo not know about [Rehnquist\u2019s] role in turning the Supreme Court away from its 1960s Warren Court approach, where the Court in some cases had seemed to be simply enshrining its policy views into the Constitution, or so the critics charged.\u201d Whether Kavanaugh will count himself among those critics remains to be seen.\n\nKavanaugh\u2019s confirmation also underscored how conservatives enjoy an actuarial advantage when it comes to the Supreme Court. Thomas, the dean of the court\u2019s conservatives, turned 70 years old last summer. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, his liberal counterpart, is 85 and Justice Stephen Breyer is 80. If Democrats capture both the White House and the Senate next year, they may be able to maintain the court\u2019s current ideological balance. If Trump wins re-election, however, it\u2019s likely that the nation\u2019s highest court will drift even further to the right. Some of these landmark precedents may yet survive the Roberts Court\u2019s scrutiny in the short term. But time is on the originalists\u2019 side."

    "text": "When society becomes more secular, those limits on capitalist striving disappear. At that point, the capitalist spirit becomes \u201cunbridled\u201d and, in Weber\u2019s words, \u201cthe pursuit of wealth, divested of its metaphysical significance, today tends to be associated with purely elemental passions, which at times virtually turn it into a sporting contest.\u201d This is an uncannily accurate picture of the work-obsessed mind in twenty-first century America. To Thompson, work is at best a form of play; at worst, \u201cIt is a diabolical game that creates a prize so tantalizing yet rare that almost nobody wins, but everybody feels obligated to play forever.\u201d \u00ad\u00ad\n\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. Citing the English Puritan theologian Richard Baxter, Weber wrote that the systematic drive to produce wealth was meant to be \u201clike a thin cloak which can be thrown off at any time.\u201d You work hard when you need to, but you can stop anytime, for God\u2019s sake or otherwise. Your work doesn\u2019t change who you are. \u201cBut fate decreed that the cloak should become an iron cage,\u201d Weber wrote. We ended up stuck with the ethic the Puritans developed, even after we stopped believing in predestination.\n\nThe Harvard Business School alumnus who told Duhigg he was wasting his life added, \u201cIf you spend 12 hours a day doing work you hate, at some point it doesn\u2019t matter what your paycheck says.\u201d (This man\u2019s paycheck says $1.2 million a year.) \u201cHe had received an offer at a start-up, and he would have loved to take it,\u201d Duhigg wrote, \u201cbut it paid half as much, and he felt locked into a lifestyle that made this pay cut impossible.\u201d The iron cage is lined in velvet.\n\nShould we even care if well-educated, well-off workers are unhappy with their jobs? Aren\u2019t other workers\u2014like the millions who don\u2019t even get a living wage\u2014suffering in more immediate ways? While millionaire stock traders complain about the meaninglessness of their work, there are a thousand people in Phoenix going through repeated emotional trauma at work to keep videos of murder and violent sex off of Facebook, as Casey Newton recently reported for The Verge. To get through the day, employees of Cognizant, which contracts with the social media giants, have sex in the stairwells and smoke pot during breaks. They become paranoid; one brought a handgun to the office, fearing disgruntled former employees. All this, and they earn less than $30,000 a year.\n\nElite attitudes toward work have disproportionate impact, though. Weber\u2019s study observed that in Germany, Protestants tended to occupy the capitalist class; laborers were more often Catholic. In his eyes, culture changes from the top down. That\u2019s true in our age, too. The \u201cdo what you love\u201d ethos that began with the creative class has become a norm for house cleaners and supermarket cashiers, as Miya Tokumitsu has shown.\n\nIf we saw work less as a way to prove one\u2019s worth, we might value it more as an economic endeavor.\n\nIf we saw work less as a way to prove one\u2019s worth or moral virtue, or a place to find \u201cmeaning,\u201d then we might begin to value it more as an economic endeavor. And if the people who are drawing great material benefit from our work culture also hate it, then maybe they will feel moved to use their economic and political power to change it for the better. To do so, elite workers can look once again to the religions that once kept capitalism in check. American Protestantism may have gotten us into our current work obsession, but it and other religions\u2014their practices adapted, perhaps, to secular tastes\u2014also offer a way out.\n\nTheology puts work in a cosmic perspective. In the book of Genesis, labor is a consequence of human sin, not a means to prove human righteousness. Even God rests from work on the seventh day. When Jesus calls his followers, he pulls them away from their ordinary jobs as fishermen and tax collectors. He teaches them to \u201clook at the birds of the air; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?\u201d He heaps woe upon the rich and shows favor to the idle poor.\n\nReligious observance interrupts the workday or workweek. For most Muslims, prayer is obligatory five times a day, which usually requires breaks from work. (Newton reported that Muslim workers at Cognizant complained they were not allowed to pray during the nine minutes of \u201cwellness time\u201d the company allows per day.) The Jewish Torah prohibits working on the Sabbath, which the rabbi and activist Abraham Joshua Heschel has described as the person\u2019s break from \u201cthe betrayal in embezzling his own life\u201d during the workweek. To enter into the Sabbath, he wrote, someone \u201cmust say farewell to manual work and learn to understand that the world has already been created and will survive without the help of\u201d human labor.\n\nYou don\u2019t necessarily have to go to church or mosque or synagogue to put rituals like this in place. It\u2019s possible to create secular versions of them. You could treat the weekend for the purpose that the labor movement intended, as two consecutive work-free days. You could even submit to an ascetical regimen to free yourself from the yoke of work. New York Times business columnist Kevin Roose recently underwent a 30-day tech detox, which included a weekend retreat to the Catskills without his phone. He was frustrated at times. \u201cBut mostly, it was great,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFor two solid days, I basked in 19th-century leisure, feeling my nerves softening and my attention span stretching out.\u201d He now has the zeal of a convert: \u201cYou have to try it.\u201d\n\nBut countercultural rituals don\u2019t work as well if you\u2019re attempting them alone. Without a community to share them with, you\u2019re just that one coworker who\u2019s not up to speed, or that weird friend whom no one can get a hold of on the weekend. Regardless of the practice you undertake, something other than work needs to be sacred, so that your job can be profane. If Americans can learn to think of work in less lofty terms, then we might begin to appreciate its material value\u2014wages, benefits, time off, pensions\u2014and lessen the agony it brings. Together, we can find more fulfilling ways to spend our lives."

    "text": "Would House Democrats censure one of their own for daring to suggest that the deep-pocketed fossil fuel lobby buys influence in Congress? What about a member who said the same about Big Pharma? And yet, Democratic leaders on Wednesday were on the cusp of implicitly rebuking U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar for criticizing the pro-Israel lobby\u2019s power. \u201cI want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is okay for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country,\u201d she said a recent event.\n\nThis was destined to be another example of the impossibility in Washington of deviating from unflinching support of Israel\u2019s policies. But then something remarkable happened. The Democrats\u2019 resolution against anti-Semitism was tabled after an outcry from members who felt Omar, a Muslim woman of color, was being singled out and that the party should condemn the full spectrum of religious bigotry, including the Islamophobia practiced by President Trump. A powerful lobby tried to suppress criticism of its work, and rank-and-file Democrats spoke their minds.\n\nOmar\u2019s latest comments were not the freshman congresswoman\u2019s first this year to draw accusations of anti-Semitism. Earlier this month, she tweeted that support in Congress for Israel was \u201call about the Benjamins baby,\u201d referring to $100 bills. She later apologized for the tweet, even though it referred to a time-honored practice in Washington. Pro-Israel supporters have gained influence through hefty political spending, just as Big Oil and Big Finance and Big Tech have. There\u2019s nothing particularly novel about that fact.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about the sums we\u2019re talking about. When considering single-issue lobbying, \u201cpro-Israel\u201d is the sixth-largest topic in Congress, larger than interest groups who lobby on abortion policy or gun control or women\u2019s issues. AIPAC, by far the largest of the pro-Israel groups, spent nearly $7 million on lobbying in 2017 and 2018 combined. Outside of lobbying, AIPAC rallies its members to assist in political campaigns of like-minded candidates. Fundraising pitches are routinely made in side rooms at AIPAC\u2019s 20,000-person strong policy conference."

    "text": "In 1997, Keith Flint was very confused. After a long youth dancing in English rural barns (literally\u2014his local club in Essex was called The Barn), the band he sang for was breaking America. With its third album, The Fat of the Land, led by the massive singles \u201cFirestarter\u201d and \u201cBreathe,\u201d The Prodigy became the first of the 1990s British dance acts to cross the Atlantic. In a Spin magazine cover story, Flint, who died this week at the age of 49, described his bafflement at the way British rave culture was being translated for Americans. People seemed to \u201cthink it\u2019s about the internet, the future, technology, play stations\u2014and it isn\u2019t!\u201d he said.\n\nThe story of how The Prodigy came to symbolize a kind of techno-dystopian darkness says as much about the late 1990s as the band itself. The Prodigy had been famous in Britain since 1991, when their debut song \u201cCharly\u201d flooded dance floors across the nation. The song sampled an informational broadcast instructing listeners to \u201calways tell your mummy before you go off somewhere\u201d over a neat little breakbeat and some noises like lasers gone haywire, in between meows from a cartoon cat. Back then, The Prodigy was sometimes derided as \u201ckiddie-techno,\u201d because of their juvenile samples and because the teens loved them. Britain\u2019s rave scene was an all-ages affair, with day-glo clothes everywhere, smiley faces, and pacifiers for the gurners.\n\nFlint started out as the band\u2019s dancer, \u00e0 la Bez from the Happy Mondays, but ended up as frontman. With the twin spears of his hairdo thrust forward, his wide boy vocals grated over Liam Howlett\u2019s clean production, a bloody smear against glass. In videos he bared his teeth and banged his head, eyes rolling. He really was a sight.\n\nFlint had met Howlett at a rave in 1989. Flint asked him for a mixtape, which he returned along with a few of his own songs. The pair were also friends with Leeroy Thornhill, a dancer like Flint, adept at a beautifully old-school shuffle. They added MC Maxim and a singer named Sharky, and The Prodigy was born. (Members would leave and join as the years wore on.) The band got popular so quickly that Howlett had to prove he hadn\u2019t sold out by anonymously releasing two stonking records, the delicious \u201cEarthbound 1\u201d and \u201cEarthbound 2.\u201d DJs sniffed when they found out that Howlett of \u201cCharly\u201d fame had cut the records, but they safeguarded his reputation."

      "Antonia Hitchens"
    ],
    "text": "\u201cA thing about Eve I\u2019ve learned,\u201d Anolik writes of her unreliable subject-narrator, is that \u201cthough she never lies, she\u2019s not always to be believed.\u201d Anolik chooses to mythologize Babitz as Babitz mythologizes herself, writing more as a disciple than as a journalist. Her biography starts out in second person singular, written as if addressing her treasured Eve: \u201cand then there\u2019s your brains. You\u2019re never not reading: Dickens, Trollope, Woolf, Proust.\u201d Like Tracy Daugherty in his unauthorized biography of Joan Didion, The Last Love Song, Anolik falls at times into a pseudo-emulation of the lyrical and discursive\u2014diverting, even\u2014aspects of Babitz\u2019s prose. An adoring acolyte of Babitz, she circles Babitz\u2019s contradictory traits, her \u201cguileless innocence and lethal knowledge all at once.\u201d She enunciates her \u201cnaturally romantic disposition,\u201d her sense of \u201cthe melodrama of the image\u201d and her instinct toward the \u201ccinematic.\u201d\n\nAnolik calls her book a \u201clove story\u201d about Babitz. There is no pretense of objectivity. \u201cMy love for her was pure, without irony or qualification, and I wanted to keep it that way,\u201d she admits. Embraced fully, this sort of biography\u2014a send-up of the absurdity and impossibility of biography itself\u2014is genre of its own. But Anolik verges on idolatry: She even puts off reading Babitz\u2019s Jim Morrison piece lest she find out that she disagrees with her beloved subject. The pitfall here is that though Anolik fills in lively background and context, a more compelling narrative emerges from Babitz\u2019s own memoiristic writing. Anolik too frequently gets waylaid thinking about her own role as Babitz\u2019s interlocutor, and in Babitz\u2019s resurgence: \u201cIsn\u2019t that the writer\u2019s ultimate fantasy,\u201d she muses, \u201cthat a thing he or she writes has an actual effect, changes the world in a visible, tangible way?\u201d She laments that \u201cforming an emotional bond is beyond Eve at this point.\u201d Babitz was \u201cunwilling or unable\u201d to accept her affection.\n\nAnolik\u2019s book includes a lengthy discussion of Babitz versus Joan Didion, a rambling comparison that is only instructive in how it elucidates the frequently tenuous position that Babitz occupied as a writer. She shared a firmament with others, but had for a long time no ground of her own to stand on, subsisting mostly on her charm until Eve\u2019s Hollywood was published in 1974 when she was 31; a lot of writing by and about Babitz focuses on her pedigree and her looks and her various lovers. While Didion had a reputation and a byline and a family, Eve\u2019s position was far shakier, Anolik writes:\n\nshe had nothing tangible or durable to rely on, only such delicate and fragrant qualities as an ability to captivate, a talent for amusing. She was there on the pleasure and whim of people better known and more powerful than she.\n\nYet Anolik\u2019s act of compare and contrast between Play It As It Lays and Slow Days, Fast Company becomes overextended and reductive. She says, for instance, that Babitz, unlike Didion, is \u201cnever a bummer.\u201d Yet she fails to take into account Didion\u2019s countless works of journalism and essays about California, including Where I Was From, Didion\u2019s consideration of her native state, an incisive love-note of its own. Their Californias were different; as Didion famously said, \u201canyone who talks about California hedonism has never spent a Christmas in Sacramento.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean that Babitz\u2019s literary career was a response to\u2014\u201cnay, a rebuttal of\u201d\u2014Play It As It Lays. Anolik expresses her odd personal dislike of Didion\u2014her \u201chomicidal designs\u201d against her own personality and her \u201ccynical\u201d and \u201csilly, shallow\u201d novel\u2014because she wants to canonize Babitz as Didion\u2019s replacement.\n\nToward the book\u2019s end, Anolik worries that she initially presented a sentimentalized version of Eve, turning her into a \u201cloveable eccentric\u201d instead of the \u201cseriously, radically strange\u201d and occasionally impetuous woman she is. But the biography also shows snippets of the Babitz from a perspective that she herself would never give the reader. In interviews with Babitz\u2019s family and paramours, Anolik dips into the dark underbelly of glamor, when the washed-up girl-about-town emerges from her bathtub covered in bruises, with a bloody nose from too much cocaine. At times, these broader shots aim to deepen an understanding of Babitz (though at moments they can also seem gratuitous). After Babitz dropped a lit match on herself while lighting a cigar at the wheel, she gave up writing. Now she mostly stays home, where she listens to conservative talk shows and, in Anolik\u2019s telling, has to be tempted with churros and tabloids and e-cigarettes in order to come outside and talk.\n\nAfter Babitz dropped a lit match on herself while lighting a cigar at the wheel, she gave up writing.\n\nRaymond Chandler wrote that \u201cHollywood is easy to hate, easy to sneer at, easy to lampoon.\u201d In Slow Days, Fast Company, when Babitz returns from a trip, she remarks that \u201cI long for vast sprawls, smog, and luke nights: L.A. It is where I work best, where I can live, oblivious to physical reality.\u201d A man who writes Babitz a fan letter from London says he has a piece she wrote pinned up on his wall, because it explains California better than he ever could. When people ask him what it\u2019s like there, he gestures to her prose. Babitz\u2019s work isn\u2019t about the feeling of displacement, but rather about a sustained cultivation of a sense of place\u2014many of her essays read as if she were writing a \u201cGoodbye to All That\u201d to her own idiosyncratic version of Los Angeles, crucially devoid of the part where she curdles on the city. She manages to be both rooted and adrift.\n\nIn her bungalow, she writes about Updike and Henry James, but also basks in the sun drinking tequila and noticing things like \u201cthe moment when a man develops enough confidence and ease in a relationship to bore you to death.\u201d Babitz proceeds almost blithely impervious to the forces of nature or history (she spent the Watts Riots in a penthouse at the Chateau Marmont.) She watches a family of overdressed tourists who have come to see Hollywood during the Santa Anas. It is not what they had hoped. They stand at the intersection of Hollywood and Vine on a windswept 105 degree morning\u2014\u201can actual tumbleweed careened into them\u201d\u2014and sigh despondently at the anti-climax. Hollywood exists only as \u201cthe ruins of an empire of the self-enchanted,\u201d explains Babitz. For her, this is home."

    "text": "RBG: Jeff, I don\u2019t think I changed. Perhaps I am a little less tentative than I was when I was a new justice. But what really changed was the composition of the Court. Think of 2006, when Justice O\u2019Connor left us, and the cases since then in which the Court divided five to four and I was one of the four, but would have been among the five if Justice O\u2019Connor had remained. So I don\u2019t think that my jurisprudence has changed, but the issues coming before the Court are getting a different reception.\n\nJR: What decisions would have come out differently if Justice O\u2019Connor were still on the Court?\n\nRBG: She would have been with us in Citizens United, in Shelby County, probably in Hobby Lobby, too.\n\nJR: Do you think she regrets her decision to retire?\n\nRBG: She made a decision long ago to retire at age seventy-five. She thought she and John1 would be able to do all the outdoorsy things they liked to do. When John\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease made those plans impossible, she had already announced her retirement. I think she must be concerned about some of the Court\u2019s rulings, those that veer away from opinions she wrote.\n\nJR: Speaking of retirements, there are some who say that you should have stepped down before the midterm elections. How do those suggestions make you feel and what\u2019s your response?\n\nRBG: First, I should say, I am fantastically lucky that I am in a system without a compulsory retirement age. Most countries of the world have age sixty-five, seventy, seventy-five, and many of our states do as well. As long as I can do the job full steam, I will stay here. I think I will know when I\u2019m no longer able to think as lucidly, to remember as well, to write as fast. I was number one last term in the speed with which opinions came down. My average from the day of argument to the day the decision was released was sixty days, ahead of the chief by some six days. So I don\u2019t think I have reached the point where I can\u2019t do the job as well.\n\nI asked some people, particularly the academics who said I should have stepped down last year: \u201cWho do you think the president could nominate and get through the current Senate that you would rather see on the Court than me?\u201d No one has given me an answer to that question.\n\nJR: Your health is good?\n\nRBG: Yes, and I\u2019m still working out twice a week with my trainer, the same trainer I now share with Justice [Elena] Kagan. I have done that since 1999.\n\nJR: Do you work out together?\n\nRBG: No, she\u2019s a lot younger than I am, younger than my daughter. She does boxing, a great way to take out your frustrations.\n\nJR: And what do you do?\n\nRBG: I do a variety of weight-lifting, elliptical glider, stretching exercises, push-ups. And I do the Canadian Air Force exercises almost every day.\n\nJR: What are the Canadian Air Force exercises?\n\nRBG: They were published in a paperback book put out by the Canadian Air Force.2 When I was twenty-nine, that exercise guide was very popular. I was with Marty3 at a tax conference in Syracuse. We stopped to pick up a lawyer to attend the morning program with us. He said, \u201cJust a moment, I have to finish my exercises.\u201d I asked him what those exercises were. He replied they were the Canadian Air Force exercises and said he wouldn\u2019t let a day go by without doing them.\n\nThe lawyer who told me about the Canadian Air Force exercises stopped doing them years ago. I still do the warm-up and stretching regime almost every day.\n\nJR: Are those the exercises you did when I met you at the Court of Appeals in 1991?\n\nRBG: No. I was part of Jazzercise class. It was an aerobics routine accompanied by loud music, sounding quite awful to me. Jazzercise was popular in the \u201980s and \u201990s.\n\nJR: You were an admirer of Chief Justice Rehnquist. How have the workings of the Court changed under Chief Justice Roberts?\n\nRBG: I was very fond of the old chief. I am also an admirer of the current chief, who had extraordinary skills as an advocate. He was a repeat player at oral argument, always super prepared, engaging in his presentation, and nimble in responding to the Court\u2019s questions. As to the change, I regard the Roberts / Rehnquist change as a \u201clike / kind exchange,\u201d an expression tax lawyers use. Our current chief is a bit more flexible at oral argument: He won\u2019t stop a lawyer or a justice in mid-sentence when the red light goes on. And at our conference, he\u2019s a little more relaxed about allowing time for cross-table discussion. As to his decisions, there\u2019s not a major shift. I\u2019m hoping that as our current chief gets older, he may end up the way Rehnquist did when he wrote for the Court upholding the Family and Medical Leave Act. That\u2019s a decision you wouldn\u2019t have believed he would ever write when he joined the Court in the early \u201970s. Chief Justice Rehnquist also decided that, as much as he disliked the Miranda decision, it had become police culture and he wasn\u2019t going to overrule it. But the big change was not Roberts for Rehnquist, it was Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s retirement.4\n\nJR: This term there were more unanimous decisions than in any time since the 1930s. Why was that the case? Is Chief Justice Roberts achieving his vision of narrow, unanimous opinions?\n\nRBG: We were unanimous, at least in the bottom-line judgment, in sixty percent of the term\u2019s cases.5 That figure is deceptive because of the disagreement among people who joined the ultimate judgment. In some of the leading cases, those disagreements were marked. For example, the recess-appointment case. The Court was unanimous that Obama\u2019s appointments to the NLRB [National Labor Relations Board] were invalid, but divided on the first two questions posed in that case: Does the president have the authority to exercise the recess power when Congress takes an intra-session recess or only when the recess occurs between sessions of Congress? The second question was, when must the vacancy occur? Must it occur during the recess? Or can the president fill up vacancies that existed before the recess? Those are questions of major importance and the Court divided sharply on the answers.\n\nJR: And then of course there have still been some big five-four decisions. Most notably, Hobby Lobby, where you criticized your male colleagues for having a \u201cblind spot\u201d on women\u2019s issues. Given Chief Roberts\u2019s preference for unanimity, how have your dissents in those cases been received within the Court?\n\nRBG: My answer to that would be, at least as well as Scalia\u2019s attention-grabbing dissents.\n\nJR: You\u2019ve made it a priority as senior associate justice to have all of the dissenters speak in one voice. Why?\n\nRBG: When I became the most senior member of four dissenters, I had a very good model to follow, Justice [John Paul] Stevens. He was always fair in assigning dissents: He kept most of them himself.\n\nJR: [laughs]\n\nRBG: I try to be fair, so no one ends up with all the dull cases while another has all the exciting cases. I do take, I suppose, more than a fair share of the dissenting opinions in the most-watched cases.\n\nJR: And you\u2019ve discouraged separate concurrences.\n\nRBG: Yes.\n\nJR: Why is that?\n\nRBG: The experience I don\u2019t want to see repeated occurred in Bush v. Gore. The Court divided five to four. There were four separate dissents, and that confused the press. In fact, some of the reporters announced that the decision was seven-two. There was no time to get together. That case was accepted by the Court on Saturday, briefed on Sunday, oral argument on Monday, decisions on Tuesday. If we had time, the four of us would have gotten together, and there might have been one dissent instead of filling far too many pages in the U.S. Reports6 with our separate dissents.\n\nJR: Generally, you\u2019ve been more reluctant to compromise than some of your colleagues. Is that a conscious decision?\n\nRBG: That was so in Bush v. Gore. It was also true more recently in the Hobby Lobby case, where Justices Breyer and Kagan said we\u2019d rather not take a position on a for-profit corporation\u2019s free-exercise rights.\n\nJR: So they wrote a separate dissent.\n\nRBG: Just a few lines of explanation. We all agreed on what was most important. It didn\u2019t matter whether the business was a sole proprietorship, a partnership, a corporation. The simple point is, we have the right to speak freely, to exercise religion freely, with this key limit. As Professor Chafee explained: \u201cWe have the right to swing our arm until it hits the other fellow\u2019s nose.\u201d7 I should emphasize that none of us questioned the genuineness of the Hobby Lobby owners\u2019 belief. That was a given. But no one who is in business for profit can foist his or her beliefs on a workforce that includes many people who do not share those beliefs.\n\nRuth Bader Ginsburg while on a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship in Italy in 1977 Courtesy of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\nJR: What\u2019s the worst ruling the current Court has produced?\n\n\n\nRBG: If there was one decision I would overrule, it would be Citizens United. I think the notion that we have all the democracy that money can buy strays so far from what our democracy is supposed to be. So that\u2019s number one on my list. Number two would be the part of the health care decision that concerns the commerce clause. Since 1937, the Court has allowed Congress a very free hand in enacting social and economic legislation.8 I thought that the attempt of the Court to intrude on Congress\u2019s domain in that area had stopped by the end of the 1930s. Of course health care involves commerce. Perhaps number three would be Shelby County, involving essentially the destruction of the Voting Rights Act. That act had a voluminous legislative history. The bill extending the Voting Rights Act was passed overwhelmingly by both houses, Republicans and Democrats, everyone was on board. The Court\u2019s interference with that decision of the political branches seemed to me out of order. The Court should have respected the legislative judgment. Legislators know much more about elections than the Court does. And the same was true of Citizens United. I think members of the legislature, people who have to run for office, know the connection between money and influence on what laws get passed.\n\nJR: If a Republican wins the White House, could Roe v. Wade be overturned?\n\nRBG: This Court had an opportunity to do that in the Casey case.9 There was a strong opinion speaking for Justice O\u2019Connor, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Souter, saying Roe v. Wade has been the law of the land since 1973, we respect precedent, and Roe v. Wade should not be overruled. If the Court sticks to that position, there will be no overruling and it won\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s a Democratic president or a Republican president.\n\nJR: And if Roe were overturned, how bad would the consequences be?\n\nRBG: It would be bad for non-affluent women. If we imagine the worst-case scenario, with Roe v. Wade overruled, there would remain many states that would not go back to the way it once was. What that means is any woman who has the wherewithal to travel, to take a plane, to take a train to a state that provides access to abortion, that woman will never have a problem. It doesn\u2019t matter what Congress or the state legislatures do, there will be other states that provide this facility, and women will have access to it if they can pay for it. Women who can\u2019t pay are the only women who would be affected.\n\nJR: So how can advocates make sure that poor women\u2019s access to reproductive choice is protected? Can legislatures be trusted or is it necessary for courts to remain vigilant?\n\nRBG: How could you trust legislatures in view of the restrictions states are imposing? Think of the Texas legislation that would put most clinics out of business. The courts can\u2019t be trusted either. Think of the Carhart decision10 or going way back to the two decisions that denied Medicaid coverage for abortion. I don\u2019t see this as a question of courts versus legislatures. In my view, both have been moving in the wrong direction. It will take people who care about poor women. The irony and tragedy is any woman of means can have a safe abortion somewhere in the United States. But women lacking the wherewithal to travel can\u2019t. There is no big constituency out there concerned about access restrictions on poor women.\n\nJR: How can that constituency be created?\n\nRBG: For one thing, the advocacy of human-rights groups can make a big difference. Going back to the 1980s, I was speaking at Duke, not about abortion in particular, but about equal opportunities for women to be whatever their God-given talent allowed them to be, without artificial barriers placed in their way. During the question period, an African American man commented: \u201cWe know what you lily-white women are all about. You want to kill black babies.\u201d That\u2019s how some in the African American community regarded the choice movement. So I think it would be helpful if civil rights groups homed in on the impact of the absence of choice on African American women. That would be useful.\n\nUltimately, the people have to organize themselves. Think of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. The Court had said discrimination on the basis of pregnancy was not discrimination on the basis of sex, and a coalition was organized to get that law passed. The ACLU was the central player, but everyone was on board. The same thing happened after the Lilly Ledbetter case. It would take a similar kind of coalition. It must start with the people. Legislatures are not going to move without that kind of propulsion.\n\nJR: When you think about your constitutional legacy, who\u2019s your model?\n\nRBG: I couldn\u2019t identify one model. There are several. Certainly, the great Chief Justice John Marshall, who made the Court what it is today. You remember that John Jay, when he was elected governor of New York, thought that was a better job than chief justice. When George Washington wanted Jay to come back again, Jay said, no, the Court will never amount to much. Marshall made the Court an independent third branch of the government, so he is certainly a hero. Another justice, one who didn\u2019t serve very long, six years, I think, was Justice Curtis, who wrote a fine dissent in the Dred Scott case.11 Some time later, the first Justice John Marshall Harlan, who dissented in Plessy v. Ferguson. Further along, of course, Brandeis and Holmes and their great dissents, mainly in the free-speech area but also in dissenting opinions explaining that social and economic legislation should be left largely to legislators and should not be second-guessed by the Court. And then, of course, Thurgood Marshall.\n\nJR: When you were an ACLU litigator in the \u201970s, you were called the Thurgood Marshall of the women\u2019s movement.\n\nRBG: He was my model as a lawyer. You mentioned that I took a step-by-step, incremental approach, well, that\u2019s what he did. He didn\u2019t come to the Court on day one and say, \u201cEnd apartheid in America.\u201d He started with law schools and universities,12 and until he had those building blocks, he didn\u2019t ask the Court to end separate-but-equal. Of course, there was a huge difference between the litigation for gender equality in the \u201970s and the civil rights struggles in the \u201950s and \u201960s. The difference between Thurgood Marshall and me, most notably, is that my life was never in danger. His was. He would go to a Southern town to defend people, some of them falsely accused, and he literally didn\u2019t know whether he would be alive at the end of the day. I never faced that kind of problem.\n\nJR: Let\u2019s talk about the laws you were able to chip away at during your time at the ACLU. Can you walk me through some of the most important victories?\n\nRBG: Every one of these cases involved a law based on the premise that men earned the family\u2019s bread and women tend to the home and children. Wiesenfeld is probably the best illustration. The plaintiff, Stephen Wiesenfeld, was a man whose wife died in childbirth. He wanted to care personally for his infant, so he sought the child-in-care Social Security benefits that would enable him to do so. But those benefits were available only for widows, not widowers. Wiesenfeld\u2019s wage-earning wife paid the same Social Security taxes that a man paid. But they netted less protection for her family. It made no sense from the point of view of the baby. The male spouse was disadvantaged as a parent. We were trying to get rid of all laws modeled on that stereotypical view of the world, that men earn the bread and women take care of the home and children.\n\nJR: Have you kept in touch with the plaintiffs from those ACLU cases?\n\nRBG: I\u2019m regularly in touch with Stephen Wiesenfeld. I officiated at his son Jason\u2019s wedding many years ago. Jason is now the father of three children. Stephen at last found the second love of his life, and I officiated at his marriage ceremony in May at the Court.\n\nJR: How much did your experience with the ACLU influence the kind of justice you became?\n\nRBG: When I was writing briefs13 for the ACLU Women\u2019s Rights Project, I tried to write them so that a justice who agreed with me could write his opinion from the brief. I conceived of myself in large part as a teacher. There wasn\u2019t a great understanding of gender discrimination. People knew that race discrimination was an odious thing, but there were many who thought that all the gender-based differentials in the law operated benignly in women\u2019s favor. So my objective was to take the Court step by step to the realization, in Justice Brennan\u2019s words, that the pedestal on which some thought women were standing all too often turned out to be a cage.\n\nJR: And you\u2019re taking a similar approach in your dissenting opinions today?\n\nRBG: My dissenting opinions, like my briefs, are intended to persuade. And sometimes one must be forceful about saying how wrong the Court\u2019s decision is.\n\nJR: How has the dynamic on the Court changed as it has added more women?\n\nRBG: Justice O\u2019Connor and I were together for more than twelve years and in every one of those twelve years, sooner or later, at oral argument one lawyer or another would call me Justice O\u2019Connor. They were accustomed to the idea that there was a woman on the Supreme Court and her name was Justice O\u2019Connor. Sandra would often correct the attorney, she would say, \u201cI\u2019m Justice O\u2019Connor, she\u2019s Justice Ginsburg.\u201d The worst times were the years I was alone. The image to the public entering the courtroom was eight men, of a certain size, and then this little woman sitting to the side. That was not a good image for the public to see.14 But now, with the three of us on the bench, I am no longer lonely and my newest colleagues are not shrinking violets. Not this term but the term before, Justice Sotomayor beat out Justice Scalia as the justice who asks the most questions during argument.15\n\nJustice Ginsburg as a professor at her alma mater, Columbia Law School, in 1980 Courtesy of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\nJR: What\u2019s your message to the new generation of feminists who really look to you as a role model?\n\nRBG: Work for the things that you care about. I think of the \u201970s, when many young women supported an Equal Rights Amendment. I was a proponent of the ERA. The women of my generation and my daughter\u2019s generation, they were very active in moving along the social change that would result in equal citizenship stature for men and women. One thing that concerns me is that today\u2019s young women don\u2019t seem to care that we have a fundamental instrument of government that makes no express statement about the equal citizenship stature of men and women. They know there are no closed doors anymore, and they may take for granted the rights that they have.\n\nJR: What is the opinion that you\u2019ve written that you think has done the most to advance civil liberties?\n\nRBG: Oh, Jeff, that\u2019s like asking which of my four grandchildren I prefer. There have been so many. Well, in the women\u2019s rights arena, the Virginia Military Institute case. So many people said to me, \u201cWhy would women want to go to that school?\u201d I wouldn\u2019t, and perhaps you, a man, wouldn\u2019t either, but there are women who are ready, willing, and able to undergo that form of education, so why should they be held back by artificial barriers?\n\nThere was a decision on the civil side that didn\u2019t get much press, it\u2019s called M.L.B. v. S.L.J.16 The Court\u2019s precedent was, if you are too poor to afford counsel or to afford a transcript in a felony case, the state must provide legal assistance for you. M.L.B. was a woman facing a deprivation of parental-rights proceedings. She was charged with being an unfit mother. She lost in the first instance and wanted to appeal, but the state\u2019s rule was, to appeal, you must purchase a transcript. M.L.B. didn\u2019t have funds to pay for one. It was technically a civil case, but I was able to persuade a majority of the Court that depriving a parent of parental status is as devastating as a criminal conviction. The Court decided that, if she can\u2019t get an appeal without a transcript, then the state must provide the transcript at no cost to her. That was a departure from the rigid separation of criminal cases, on the one hand, with the right to counsel paid by the state and a transcript paid by the state, and civil cases, in which you do not have those rights. You must be able to pay. I thought M.L.B. was a significant case in that regard, getting the Court to think about the impact on a woman like M.L.B. of being declared a non-parent. It is devastating, much worse than six months in jail.\n\nJR: And for dissents, your Gonzalez v. Carhart dissent is quite memorable.\n\nRBG: That was in a partial-birth abortion case. And there what concerned me about the Court\u2019s attitude, they were looking at the woman as not really an adult individual. The opinion said that the woman would live to regret her choice. That was not anything this Court should have thought or said. Adult women are able to make decisions about their own lives\u2019 course no less than men are. So, yes, I thought in Carhart the Court was way out of line. It was a new form of \u201cBig Brother must protect the woman against her own weakness and immature misjudgment.\u201d\n\nJR: Is there one case where you wish you had a do-over? A decision you regret or a position you wish you had articulated even more forcefully?\n\nRBG: I would repeat the advice that Judge Edward Tamm gave me when I was a new judge on the D.C. Circuit. It goes like this: Work hard on each opinion, but once the case is decided, don\u2019t look back; go on to the next case and give it your all. It\u2019s not productive to worry about what\u2019s out and released, over and done. That\u2019s advice I now give to people new to the judging business.\n\nJR: I know you have to get to another appointment. But before we wrap up, I wanted to make sure we talk about Scalia/Ginsburg, the opera. How did the show come about?\n\nRBG: Derrick Wang, the writer, librettist, composer is a delightful young man. He was a music major at Harvard, he has a master\u2019s in music from Yale, and then he decided he should know a little bit about the law. He\u2019s from Baltimore and he enrolled in the University of Maryland Law School. And in his second year, he took constitutional law, and read opinions by Justice Scalia, opinions by me, sometimes for the Court, sometimes in dissent, and he thought he could make a very funny opera about our divergent views. So that\u2019s how it all started. Many of the lines are straight out of opinions and speeches we\u2019ve given. The piece opens with Nino\u2019s rage aria, which begins: \u201cThe Justices are blind/how can they possibly spout this/the Constitution says absolutely nothing about this.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s another scene where Nino is locked up in a dark room for excessive dissenting. I come to rescue him, entering through a glass ceiling and singing a \u201cQueen of the Night\u201d\u2013type aria.\n\nJR: I love the fact that your character first appears to the music of Carmen.\n\nRBG: I like the last duet, \u201cWe Are Different, We Are One.\u201d The idea is that there are two people who interpret the Constitution differently yet retain their fondness for each other, and much more than that, their reverence for the institution that employs them.\n\nThis article has been updated."

    "text": "Everybody hates taxes. That\u2019s one of the unalienable truths in U.S. politics, and it\u2019s been proven again as the April 15 filing deadline approaches. A drop in tax refunds earlier this year, potentially due to the Republican tax cuts in late 2017, infuriated Americans.*\n\nMy husband and I owed money for the first time ever, and are \u201cmiddle class\u201d according to the tax brackets.\n\n\n\nWe don\u2019t even make 50k/yr.\n\n\n\nNo EIC, elimination of other write-offs and deductions, meant the IRS keeps 4K we already paid and we still owe $79. #GOPTaxSCAMStories \u2014 VP Wright (@thevpwright) February 9, 2019\n\nWhile Republicans have long argued that opposition to taxes is baked into the country\u2019s DNA, both parties see tax increases as an existential threat. In 2015, the Republican pollster Frank Luntz expressed the conventional wisdom, telling Bill O\u2019Reilly that taxes were an \u201cemotional\u201d issue for voters: \u201cNobody wants to see their taxes go up.\u201d For much of the country\u2019s history, a simple calculus has defined political life: Voters reward politicians when taxes go down and punish them when they go up.\n\n\n\nDemocrats, long tarred as the party of high taxes, face a growing problem as they propose ambitious and expensive programs like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. Fox News and other right-wing outlets have latched on to studies estimating that Medicare for All would cost $32 trillion over ten years and that the Green New Deal would cost $93 trillion. On Tuesday, more than 100 Democrats rolled-out the most ambitious single-payer health care bill yet, a sweeping plan that would enroll everyone in a government-funded program in only two years. But one detail, caught by a number of outlets, was missing: How much it would cost.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why Democrats are under-emphasizing the cost of these plans. They want to focus on the benefits, not the drawbacks. And understating costs\u2014including potential tax increases\u2014could lead to political disaster, as it famously did for George H. W. Bush after he broke his \u201cread my lips\u201d pledge not to raise taxes. Putting a multi-trillion price tag on any pitch to voters is similarly problematic and could ultimately doom these efforts before they get off the ground."

As for environmental degradation, humanity will surely find a way to counteract this in time. \u201cAs the world has gotten richer,\u201d Pinker explains, \u201cnature has begun to rebound\u201d\u2014as if the failure of a few prophecies of ecological disaster to come to pass on schedule means the planet is infinitely resilient. Once he gets around to acknowledging that climate change is an actual problem, Pinker spends much of his time attacking \u201cclimate justice warriors\u201d for their anti-capitalist hysteria.\n\nOr take inequality. Sure, some perceive a rampant crisis in most nations, but it is all sort of boring and overblown, by Pinker\u2019s lights. \u201cI need a chapter on the topic,\u201d he writes, apparently willing himself to push through his fatigue with the subject, \u201cbecause so many people have been swept up in the dystopian rhetoric and see inequality as a sign that modernity has failed to improve the human condition.\u201d In his cursory treatment, Pinker tries to downplay currently exploding levels of national inequality, by pointing out that global inequality is declining: Even if the gap between the richest and the rest in individual countries is widening, on a world scale inequality is falling slightly. Never mind that it is within their individual countries that most people are experiencing and responding to inequality, and wreaking havoc because of it. In any case, Pinker argues, it does not matter morally if some people get extremely wealthy, so long as poverty decreases.\n\nSure, some perceive a rampant crisis of inequality in most nations, but it is all sort of boring and overblown, by Pinker\u2019s lights.\n\nJust as in his somewhat literal understanding of violence, Pinker simply cannot see something so straightforward as class rule, which has been massively reestablished in our time of inequality, with all the baleful effects it has had on politics. In a world in which the outsized gains of the rich allow them to live a separate existence from the rest\u2014stooping only to buy elections with dark money and even induce populists to act in their interest\u2014rage is not only an expected but also an understandable result. The fact that these forms of domination and hierarchy are features of the very modernity he wants to lionize is not a possibility Pinker pauses to contemplate. Each of his arguments on the subject is a way of saying he doesn\u2019t think inequality is that important\u2014even as populists across the world are reaping gains from the obvious conclusion that it is.\n\nIt is disappointing and unconvincing to see Pinker wave these points aside or use debater\u2019s tricks to minimize them, skating past the contemporary anger at regress or stagnation. This outright refusal to acknowledge a messy picture is revealing. Pinker cannot bring himself to admit the possibility that some things are getting better while others get worse, and that even the best trends are subject to frightening interruption or outright reversal. Pinker\u2019s insistence that all potential qualms about progress\u2014from the environment to inequality\u2014are actually trivial suggests that he is trying to prove an unalloyed optimism no amount of facts could ever establish.\n\nWhile Pinker elects himself the heir of Enlightenment, his whole approach betrays Enlightenment principles. The very past authorities Pinker invokes did not want to hawk psychic uppers for those in doubt and far more openly advertised the ambivalence of their own belief in progress. They neither claimed that progress was universal nor insisted so monotonously on its indefinite continuation. \u201cFar from basking in cheerful certainty,\u201d as historian of the Enlightenment Peter Gay once put it, thinkers of the time \u201cqualified their hopes with reservations.\u201d And speaking for many, Scottish historian and philosopher David Hume put it bluntly: \u201cNo advantages in this world are pure and unmixed.\u201d\n\nPinker is especially unfaithful to his Enlightenment source in treating progress as a fact that can be proved through endless statistics and information gathering. Immanuel Kant wisely observed that \u201cthe problem of progress cannot be solved directly from experience.\u201d \u201cEven if it were found that the human race as a whole had been moving forward and progressing for an indefinitely long time,\u201d he wrote, \u201cno one could guarantee that its era of decline was not beginning at that very moment.\u201d One would simply have to believe it was or was not. A compilation of facts about how awesome life is becoming does not guarantee that it will continue that way. A data dump is not a philosophy of history.\n\nMany Enlightenment thinkers recognized that progress is a provisional faith, precisely because they knew how closely belief in progress resembled the very religion they otherwise wanted to transcend. They understood that the impulse to see human history as a story of progress was closely related to Christian belief. No ancient thinkers had propounded such a doctrine. Christians committed to the idea of reform, however, developed the notion of history as a proving ground for humans, allowing them to participate, to some degree or other, in the unfolding of God\u2019s design. For most Enlightenment thinkers, progress would have to represent Christian beliefs in a more reasoned form.\n\nA compilation of facts about how awesome life is becoming does not guarantee that it will continue that way. A data dump is not a philosophy of history.\n\nKant, for example, thought he could discern a \u201chidden plan\u201d for universal freedom and equality in the shape of events. To those who sought a guarded optimism, facts served as \u201csigns\u201d of this future, Kant concluded, and he cited the French Revolution as the most startling herald of universal freedom and equality. But he insisted that even an abundance of such signs could never, on their own, establish belief in progress. What facts provide is a catapult for a leap into rational faith. \u201cHopes for the future perfection of men,\u201d the German philosopher Karl L\u00f6with explained bluntly in a classic study of the philosophy of progress, are \u201cnot the result of scientific inference and evidence but a conjecture, the root of which [is] hope and faith.\u201d It is a devastating verdict on Pinker\u2019s enterprise.\n\nPinker attempts valiantly to sidestep the need for what Kant called \u201crational faith,\u201d partly by narrowing his inquiry to the most minimal terms of advancement, terms he imagines no one could dispute. From the outset, Pinker insists that he can read progress off simple metrics such as how many people survive childhood and live relatively long. And who could deny that, whatever ultimate ends people care about, they would all like to survive and thrive? But if one claims to be making \u201cthe case for humanism,\u201d as Pinker does, isn\u2019t the way people live also important? A lot of people actually care about meaning and even transcendence\u2014living well rather than just living. This is a secondary consideration for Pinker. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to extol transcendent values,\u201d he observes, in this spirit, \u201cbut most people prioritize life, health, safety, literacy, sustenance, and stimulation.\u201d\n\nSensing the limitations of his first tactic, Pinker claims that what really matters for progress is that people get what they want. Beyond basic creaturely survival, Pinker concludes, progress consists in allowing more and more people to define and embrace their own good. \u201cThe ultimate goal of development,\u201d he observes, paraphrasing Amartya Sen, \u201cis to enable people to make choices.\u201d But the real question is not whether individuals believe they are better off\u2014votaries of universal emancipation in the Enlightenment and since have always worried that without sufficient education people are as apt to throw their freedom away as to use it well. Pinker\u2019s vision of a utopia of lifestyle choices might convince people who already believe that universal progress will involve ample e-commerce and plane travel. But it is unlikely to captivate those who think we are very far from the economic and political institutions that would bring humanity genuine liberation.\n\nAs if Pinker\u2019s failure to establish his own case for optimism were not enough, he ends his book with a lengthy screed against holdouts and malcontents. Some of his ire is justified\u2014there is a lot of obscurantism in the world\u2014but most works to bypass rather than engage. Pinker takes up his chief b\u00eate noire, Nietzsche, not by reading his works but by culling inflammatory quotations from another intellectual brief in favor of Enlightenment values. True, Nietzsche said some foolish things. (Pinker takes issue with his call for \u201cthe merciless extermination of everything degenerate and parasitical.\u201d) But he was in his own way a scion of the Enlightenment. Like his great forebear Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Nietzsche was sensitive to the fact that progress and regress can coexist, and he worried that it is all too easy to misrepresent conformity as freedom.\n\nThat there are different ways of defending the Enlightenment, and that modern intellectual history is mostly a debate about how to do so, is not a possibility that registers in this book. Its author has not even begun to think about what it would take to preach uplifting optimism about the future in a time when crushing dereliction threatens more openly each day. Big changes rather than gleeful self-congratulations are in order if progress is to become our mantra anytime soon. The most formidable challenge to Pinker\u2019s vision ultimately comes from the Enlightenment itself. Not only is authentic optimism not data-driven, but it may have to be established by heirs of reason and humanism who make Pinker look complacent."

    "text": "On Sunday, the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team (USWNT) won the World Cup for the third time\u2014more than any other team in women\u2019s soccer history. For their efforts, the team will earn $2 million in prize money, up from $1 million in 2011. The money is awarded to the national federation, which usually distributes it between players and the organization itself. That\u2019s not a bad sum\u2014until it\u2019s put into context. Last year, the U.S. men\u2019s team was knocked out of the Round of 16 at the World Cup in Brazil\u2014and pocketed $9 million for it. Germany, which went on to win the tournament, was awarded $35 million.\n\nThe U.S. Women just got paid 4x *LESS* to win the World Cup than the U.S. Men did to lose in the Round of 16. #USAvsJPN #WorldCupFinal \u2014 cmclymer\n\nThese numbers are exemplary of the huge discrepancy between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s game both globally and in the U.S. After the celebrations and media appearances, the stars of the USWNT\u2014Carli Lloyd, Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan\u2014will go back to playing in the National Women\u2019s Soccer League (NWSL), the third attempt at professionalizing the women\u2019s game in the U.S. The NWSL is only in its third year, but if it survives this year it will have outlived its predecessors.\n\nFirst, there was the Women\u2019s United Soccer Association (WUSA), established two years after Mia Hamm, Brandi Chastain, and Julie Foudy helped the U.S. defeat China in the tense 1999 final. It folded after only three years due to financial problems. Then, in 2009, months after the U.S. won the Olympic gold medal, Women\u2019s Professional Soccer was born. That, too, lasted only three years. The current iteration, the National Women\u2019s Soccer League (NWSL), is partially subsidized by the American, Canadian, and Mexican soccer federations, but both attendance and salaries are dismally low.\n\nPlayers like Lloyd, Rapinoe, and Morgan ply their trade in a league where salaries range from $6,000 to $30,000 per season. In cities like Chicago, Seattle, and Boston, where Hope Solo, Julie Johnston, and Rapinoe, play, that\u2019s well below the median income. Even Abby Wambach, the most famous of the USWNT players, made $190,000 last year\u2014not bad compared to the average population\u2014but 3 percent of what Clint Dempsey put in the bank ($6.7 million)."

    "text": "He peered down and began to read from the old Merriam-Webster.\n\n\u201cEratosthenes was 276 B.C. to 194 B.C. He measured the circumference of the Earth from the sun\u2019s rays at separated points.\u201d\n\nTrebek closed the book and flipped over a sheet of paper on which the day\u2019s \u201cJeopardy!\u201d questions were printed. He began to sketch: the solar system.\n\n\u201cHe could look at the shadow at noon and see how long it was over here, and he managed to figure out, \u2018Hey, the Earth is round.\u2019 And then we went through the Dark Ages where people believed\u2014they got rid of all of this philosophy and all of this great stuff that the Greeks and Arabs had come up with. They decided, well, no, \u2018The Earth is flat.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe pen strokes grew vigorous.\n\n\u201cAnd then they went back to, \u2018The sun revolves around the Earth.\u2019\n\n\u201cDuh!\u201d Trebek said.\n\nTrebek has built his career on an air of erudition. But offscreen he is equally invested in a second persona, one that colleagues say has emerged more in recent years. This other Trebek is \u201cmuch less of a \u2018Masterpiece Theater\u2019 guy,\u201d is how a staffer puts it. \u201cHe\u2019s more of a getting-his-hands-dirty guy.\u201d\n\nSo even as Trebek might casually draw the solar system during conversation\u2014because of course that\u2019s a thing the host of \u201cJeopardy!\u201d would do\u2014he also takes pride in noting that he was almost kicked out of boarding school as a boy. He sometimes brags about his breakfast of Snickers and Diet Pepsi and likes to talk about the rec-league hockey games he suited up for with Dave Coulier (the \u201cFull House\u201d star who was not John Stamos, Bob Saget, or an Olsen twin). He has had two heart attacks but sums up his current exercise regimen as \u201cI drink.\u201d Yes, Trebek can describe for you the 1928 Mouton that he once tasted. But, he is quick to joke: \u201cI\u2019m not a true wine connoisseur. I\u2019m just a drinker.\u201d\n\nFact, according to Trebek: His favorite place in Los Angeles these days is Home Depot. He and his second wife, Jean, whom Trebek married in 1990 when she was 26 and he was a 49-year-old divorc\u00e9, live in a nice house in the Valley, and he spends a great deal of time thinking about maintenance and improvements (which he accomplishes with the help of \u201cManuel and Miguel\u201d). Trebek says that when he gets up in the middle of the night\u2014he has terrible insomnia\u2014he will lie awake for hours plotting how to fix the sliver of light peeking through his window, and all the other home-repair projects he wants to tackle next.\n\nTrebek grew up in Sudbury, Ontario. During his college days at the University of Ottawa, he held down jobs at both a local radio and TV station, scrambling around town to avoid missing classes or shifts. He got his start as a host in 1963, when he was cast to emcee a Canadian program called \u201cMusic Hop.\u201d He was 33 when he moved to Hollywood to helm \u201cThe Wizard of Odds\u201d on NBC. (Alan Thicke, the Canadian father of famous line-blurrer Robin Thicke, gave Trebek that first south-of-the-border job.) Clips of his early work show a natural performer. All elements of the singular Trebekian delivery\u2014crisp enunciation, acrobatic inflections, hammy dignity\u2014are there, along with a not-yet-faded accent.\n\nPhotograph by Ian Allen\n\nWhen \u201cJeopardy!\u201d hired Trebek as host in 1984, the franchise was emerging from nearly a decade off the air. The show had been the creation of Julann Griffin, wife of game-show impresario Merv Griffin, who dreamed up the format while quiz shows were recovering from the 1950s cheating scandals at \u201cThe $64,000 Question\u201d and \u201cTwenty-One.\u201d Her insight was that the game could not appear to be rigged if you went ahead and gave the answers to the contestants and asked them to supply the questions instead. Trebek added to that his showman\u2019s knack for drawing out contenders and filling silences with easy patter. He quickly propelled \u201cJeopardy!\u201d to a level of popularity never achieved under his now-forgotten predecessor. (The correct response to a very hard final round clue would be: \u201cWho is Art Fleming?\u201d)\n\nIn their early years, quiz shows were a platform for striving immigrants to show themselves as the intellectual equals of establishment WASPs, or at least gain some recognition for their smarts. \u201cJeopardy!\u201d came out of that tradition, and as mass culture coarsened, it stood as an archipelago of aspirational dweebiness in a sea of hair-metal music videos and prime-time soaps. But if \u201cJeopardy!\u201d once stood athwart history yelling, \u201cStop!\u201d\u2014and rewarded those able to recall who originally coined that phrase\u2014there is plenty of fodder for declinists in the gradual devolution of what the show considers cultural literacy.\n\nToday\u2019s games feature far fewer questions in subjects like philosophy or classical music, statistically the most difficult categories. A recent Time study plumbing the trove of \u201cJeopardy!\u201d data maintained on a fansite called J-Archive showed that references to Albert Einstein peaked 15 years ago; newer episodes reference Justin Bieber more than twice as often. During the tapings I watched, there was a question about twerking, which Miley Cyrus had just weeks earlier brought into the boomer vernacular via her performance at the Video Music Awards. No contestant got a question about Samuel Coleridge correct, which might have been less noteworthy if they hadn\u2019t been so quick to buzz in with \u201cWho is Dan Brown?\u201d on the clue directly preceding it. A recent category\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s a Rap\u201d\u2014required Trebek to spit verse: \u201cAin\u2019t. Nuthin.\u2019 But. A. Gee. Thang,\u201d he gamely recited, his diction as sharp-cornered as ever. It was funny. For the viewer, anyway.\n\nAccording to head writer Billy Wisse, \u201cJeopardy!\u201d is merely adjusting along with the evolving canon. His team needs to write the games so that contestants will still have a shot at knowing the answers; just as important, they have to ensure that the people playing along at home still get to feel good about their intellects. \u201cThey don\u2019t know as much about Theodore Dreiser as they used to,\u201d Wisse said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad, but it\u2019s so big that it seems a shame to mourn for it. There\u2019s not much anyone can do.\u201d\n\nWhat did Trebek think of that twerking question, I wondered in his dressing room between shows one day. He was on the couch. He indicated that I should sit on a distant chair.\n\n\u201cWell. So,\u201d he said. Then an extended pause. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nTrebek\u2019s considerable charm has an on / off switch that he will flick in the middle of a sentence. Offstage, he creates silences, lets a curt reply linger, answers questions with a sullen \u201cOK.\u201d The later in the day, the more it happens. Trebek shifted into this mode again when I asked him if it might be possible to come hang out with him at the house he spends so much time working on and thinking about. His p.r. team had indicatedbeforehand that it might be a possibility, depending on his mood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna be so busy because of all the work I\u2019ve got going on,\u201d Trebek began. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a new decking around the pool, and I\u2019m gonna have to be working with contractors for the trellis work that I\u2019m gonna do it. This is not a good time, unfortunately.\u201d I got the impression that anytime would be bad, where this particular request was concerned.\n\nLately Trebek\u2019s insomnia has grown more severe. His hairdresser, Renee, who refers to herself as his second wife, nags him affectionately to take his ZzzQuil, but he forgets. He\u2019ll sometimes have been up for hours by the time he heads to the set. Before the day\u2019s tapings begin, Trebek and the staff of \u201cJeopardy!\u201d meet in a timeworn room kitted out like a middle-school library, with a whole bookshelf stuffed with bright yellow volumes from the For Dummies series. People who come to work at \u201cJeopardy!\u201d tend to stay\u2014Trebek and the producers are good bosses, everyone says\u2014so the show\u2019s employees are little older and dowdier than might be found on other Culver City lots. The questions, which Trebek doesn\u2019t write but will edit or spike as he sees fit, have been drafted long before these sessions. This is rehearsal time, and Trebek uses it to go over things like pronunciation and pacing. As he will admit without being asked, he would not know all the answers without the script in front of him.\n\nOn the morning I sat in, Harry Friedman, the executive producer for both \u201cJeopardy!\u201d and \u201cWheel of Fortune,\u201d was running late. So Trebek passed the time by telling the writers about his weekend. He\u2019d taken Jean to Napa. They\u2019d flown in a 1928 biplane\u2014\u201cI told the pilot afterwards, I love weightlessness in the morning!\u201d\u2014and gone to brunch.\n\nTrebek called to a researcher in a nearby office. \u201cSuzanne? Do me a favor! Google the French Laundry up in Yountville. Find out how much the brunch cost. I think it\u2019s $350,\u201d Trebek said. \u201cI got my money\u2019s worth, \u2018cause I was the only one drinking at the table.\u201d\n\nSuzanne, a middle-aged woman in a long skirt, came in with a printout. Fact: The chef\u2019s tasting menu at the French Laundry was currently going for $250.\n\nTrebek\u2019s wife is serious about her church, the North Hollywood Church of Religious Science. While the Trebeks were in Napa, Dr. Eben Alexander, the author of Proof of Heaven, was giving a talk nearby. The couple went to check it out. \u201cThat ring a bell with anybody?\u201d Trebek asked. \u201cHe\u2019s the doctor who went into a coma for a week . . .\u201d\n\nA writer cut in: \u201cDidn\u2019t they say he was a fraud?\u201d\n\nTrebek looked puzzled: \u201cA fraud? I don\u2019t know. He lied? How could he have lied? It\u2019s his experience.\u201d\n\nChurch friends comprise the core of the Trebeks\u2019 social life, he says, a big shift from the bachelor years when he tooled around Holly-wood in a Bentley convertible. Mostly, he unwinds by watching television. \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cDeadwood\u201d are recent favorites; the Lakers a constant. During football season, he follows the Redskins, whom he doesn\u2019t think should change their name. \u201cThey weren\u2019t called the Redskins because we thought Redskins were terrible; it\u2019s because we admire their strength, their abilities,\u201d he says. In his dressing room one day, Trebek had on Fox News in the background. \u201cSomebody was saying on television a few days ago that the Tea Party is a reflection of the people. There are a lot of people out there who are not happy with the way things are going, and they\u2019ve banded together,\u201d he told me later, though he declined to reveal whom he voted for in the last presidential election and, when pressed, said he\u2019s \u201capolitical.\u201d\n\nFact: When Trebek shaved off his moustache in 2001, he did it in the middle of the day, himself, without warning the \u201cJeopardy!\u201d producers. Renee was alarmed to come in and find him mid-shearing. He just felt like it, he says now. \u201cAnd it got so much press, I couldn\u2019t believe it. The wars with Iraq or whatever at that time, and people are all in a stew over my moustache. I have one response: Get a life.\u201d\n\nAnother fact about Trebek: the \u201cJeopardy!\u201d theme song, which he has heard tens of thousands of times in his life, never gets stuck in his head, or so he says. The cameras and the crowds do wonders for his disposition. \u201cI\u2019m feeling really good today,\u201d he said at the beginning of one episode. Turning to the contestants, he added, \u201cLet\u2019s get to work, shall we?\u201d It\u2019s that consciously workmanlike quality to the tapings that brings the ancient Greek scientist-citing Trebek into alignment with his Home Depot\u2013loving side. \u201cThe best part of the job is the thirty minutes I spend onstage with the contestants running the game,\u201d he told me. \u201cI do\u2014I really do\u2014enjoy talking to the audiences.\u201d\n\nPerhaps for his own sake as much as theirs, then, Trebek chats with crowd members during commercial breaks, inviting them to ask him anything they want. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the air for fifty years,\u201d Trebek told me, \u201cso I\u2019m like a member of the family. Oh, there\u2019s Alex. Well, we\u2019d better get him a drink and get him some French fries or potato chips or whatever. They just want to know if I am in reality the way they perceive me on television. Is he a nice guy or not? Is he aloof or not?\u201d Trebek feels loyalty to his fans\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t have to talk to the audience,\u201d he notes, correctly. But the questions tend to be the same, show after show, and are less than probing. What did he have for dinner the night before? someone wanted to know. He had the halibut, \u201cjust for the hell of it.\u201d\n\nWhat Trebek really loves is doing impressions for the crowd. He makes a study of them; he\u2019ll come into the \u201cJeopardy!\u201d offices and ask his staff if they\u2019ve noticed the way a certain famous person carries his hands, or if they\u2019ve ever registered the eyebrow tic of an obscure character actor.\n\n\u201cYou got spunk. I hate spunk,\u201d he told me one day,out of nowhere, then demanded to know if I could identify the source of the quote.\n\nNope.\n\nHe followed with another line, this one in a different, high-pitched voice: \u201cOh, Mr. Grant! ...\u201d\n\nDisappointment at my silence.\n\n\u201cEd Asner as Lou Grant to Mary Tyler Moore.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s impersonations of Hollywood icons that Trebek really nails, though he doesn\u2019t like to let on how much effort he puts into the routines. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed in the last few years, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m very good at them anymore,\u201d he told the \u201cJeopardy!\u201d audience during one time-out. \u201cProbably a factor of too much alcohol.\n\n\u201cIf I could learn to stop drinking the morning of taping, that would help a lot,\u201d Trebek continued. \u201cBut you see, um, I have trouble sleeping. Yesterday, for instance, I woke up at two o\u2019clock and was awake until 5:15 and then my alarm went off at 5:25. Today I woke up at 3:00 and was awake until 5:20. . . . I\u2019m of the old school, which says, \u2018It\u2019s five o\u2019clock somewhere, so why not now?!\u2019 \u201d\n\nA beat. Trebek\u2019s comic timing is good. \u201cBut I no longer drink when I drive,\u201d he said. \u201cI pull over to the side of the road.\u201d\n\nWhen Trebek was growing up, he said not long into our first conversation, he wanted to be the prime minister of Canada, or a doctor, or an actor. He likes to tell \u201cJeopardy!\u201d audiences that because he achieved none of them, he\u2019s a failure. \u201cGets a laugh,\u201d he told me. By the time I stood in his dressing room during a lunch break between shows one day, I\u2019d heard him say it twice. He was sitting in a white t-shirt, a hint of tummy showing. And so I asked: \u201cWas there any truth to the joke?\u201d\n\nA producer came in. Trebek stood up. \u201cWhen something is important enough to you, you do it. So obviously if I haven\u2019t done it, it\u2019s because maybe it wasn\u2019t all that important to me.\u201d Button-down on and buttoned, microphone hidden, suit jacket donned and smoothed. \u201cThe secret to happiness, of course, is not getting what you want; it\u2019s wanting what you get,\u201d he added.\n\n(Fact: That piece of wisdom, according to Google, originated with one Rabbi Hyman Schachtel.)\n\nLater, I happened to run into Trebek on my way to the set\u2019s parking lot. He usually drives a Dodge Ram 1500, \u201ca half-ton pickup,\u201d as he had noted to me with pride. \u201cI\u2019m not a macho man because it doesn\u2019t have a gun rack. It has a wine rack! Just so that I can drink while I drive,\u201d Trebek joked, recycling a punch line.\n\nBut here he stood chatting with a man in a golf cart next to a white Jaguar in the choicest reserved parking spot.\n\nHe spotted me and waved. \u201cI\u2019m only driving the Jag today,\u201d he yelled, \u201cbecause my wife has the truck.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, Trebek roared off.\n\n\n\nNoreen Malone is a senior editor at New York."

    "text": "When I moved to New York, it was to Brooklyn, like a good millennial queer, in part in search of a sexual community I felt I was missing. But the job I\u2019d found was in Manhattan and I began to explore the city for signs of entry. It struck me as strange, as I walked from one bar in the West Village to another in the East, how the community I was seeking seemed only to exist in a few institutions between these few avenues, and from there had radiated across the world to call me to it. This was of course a ludicrous thing for me to believe\u2014for one thing, there were bars and parties all around my apartment. But as a newcomer, my orientation was toward Manhattan and I couldn\u2019t yet see the borough I had landed in as pertaining to the fantasy of my New York sexual self.\n\nWHEN BROOKLYN WAS QUEER: A HISTORY by Hugh Ryan St. Martin\u2019s Press, 320 pp., $29.99\n\nIt is this error that Hugh Ryan\u2019s new history attempts to correct. When Brooklyn Was Queer proceeds on the assumption that my mistake is widely shared. In his epilogue, he recounts how he also once assumed that Brooklyn had no history of queer community to speak of before the new millennium, when people like he and I (that is, the children of suburbanization) began to move there. But once he began to look for it, he discovered a rich past, from lesbian welders in the Navy Yard to queer culture in bathhouses and freak shows in Coney Island. His larger argument is that \u201cthe development of Brooklyn would track with the development of modern sexuality\u201d for roughly a century from 1855 to 1965, when the borough\u2019s postwar industrial decline and urban renewal would also bury these communities. The unique experience of queer communities in Brooklyn during this time, he argues, formed the prehistory to the modern gay liberation movement and its signal event, the Stonewall riots. It\u2019s a satisfying retort to the idea that there was nothing queer there before.\n\nA hungry archivist, Hugh Ryan unearths vivid material to populate this story. Taking the Brooklyn Heights publication of Walt Whitman\u2019s Leaves of Grass as a starting point\u2014sure, why not?\u2014he depicts early queer lives around the city\u2019s waterfront, from the neighborhoods of Red Hook to the Navy Yard. Brooklyn Heights and the city\u2019s \u201cpulsing heart,\u201d Fulton Ferry landing, are consecrated in verse by a poem of Whitman\u2019s, which, Ryan ventures, might contain the first description of cruising in American literature. \u201cBrooklyn\u2019s waterfront offered the density, privacy, diversity, and economic possibility that would allow queer people to find each other in ever-increasing numbers,\u201d he writes, echoing John D\u2019Emilio\u2019s argument that the emergence of sexual identity reflected the economic transition from family-centered household production to a society where people depended on a wage to support themselves. One result of this was the birth of communities of sexual interest in cities, and port cities like Brooklyn above all.\n\nWhitman kept a daybook listing the working-class men he made sexual advances toward, a record of the cruising spots and practices of 1860s Brooklyn:"

    "text": "\u201cEquates with?\u201d suggested a student.\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Isaacs said.\n\nThe article came down. \u201cNow,\u201d Isaacs continued, slapping another article onto the overhead projector, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong here?\u201d\n\nEveryone looked a little uncomfortable. Ises, wases and has beens clotted the prose.\n\n\u201cIs?\u201d someone offered.\n\n\u201cAside from that,\u201d Isaacs said.\n\nThe article under inspection concerned the disillusionment of male students at Vassar. (Murdoch\u2019s daughter was a Vassar graduate.) Mainly, the piece consisted of a few limp quotes from a single source, a man who wished that he hadn\u2019t attended Vassar. Its chief weakness was that it was entirely devoid of interest, probably even to the person who wrote it. Like most of the other pieces, it emitted a sad, dispirited, homework smell. Also, its author had several times confused \u201ctheir\u201d with \u201cthere,\u201d and had split a pair of infinitives.\n\nAfter a few unsuccessful guesses, the class gave up.\n\n\u201cLook again,\u201d Isaacs said.\n\nWe all looked again.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see it?\u201d Isaacs asked.\n\nWe didn\u2019t see it.\n\n\u201cVassar,\u201d he said.\n\nWe were dumfounded.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s spelled Vassar with an e.\u201d\n\nThere was a little gasp of silence. It was true. \u201cVasser\u201d stared out at us, accusingly.\n\n\u201cThose of you who don\u2019t own spell checkers, get one,\u201d Isaacs bellowed. \u201cThose nits! Those nits are what make the total. That\u2019s what journalism is! It\u2019s getting the details right. Get everything right! Precisely, 100 percent right. If you can\u2019t get everything right, you better question whether this is the right place for you. As Flaubert said, God is in the details.\u201d\n\nActually, he didn\u2019t. Mies van der Rohe did. Flaubert, if he said anything close, said God is in the good details, although even that never has been verified. Isaacs went uncorrected, however, which is one of the advantages of being a dean instead of a journalist. Just about every student was preoccupied with the terrible fear that the woman in the front row who had been shifting around in her seat throughout the ruthless indictment of the unsigned piece was actually going to admit to having written it. Each time she motioned with her hand a silent brain-scream filled the room.\n\n\u201cO.K., I admit it,\u201d she finally said. \u201cIt\u2019s mine. I must have hit the return button, like F3, when I ran the spell check.\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d Isaacs said.\n\nWith a nip here and a tuck there, the inadequately schooled journalist could easily make the Columbia School of Journalism sound like a seven-month extension of this anecdote. Perhaps I am that journalist. The essential point here is that the desperate futility of journalism instruction becomes clearer the closer one gets to the deed. At journalism school, one does not simply report a story. One develops a \u201csearch strategy for mass communication\u201d (see chart above). The principal text used at Columbia, in a section called \u201cTruth Telling,\u201d offers the mathematical formula: Story=Truth + X. \u201cThe story is never the full truth,\u201d it intones. \u201cThere is always an X, a missing ingredient. Actually there is not an X but a series -- X1,X2,X3,X4....\u201d This sort of irrelevant blather infects the entire curriculum. Here, for instance, is how the Columbia course bulletin describes one of the two main core courses, \u201cCritical Issues in Journalism\u201d:\n\nThe principal concerns troubling modern journalists are examined in both their ethical and historical contexts. Topics cover such themes as the ethical reverberations in using and being used by sources of news; the debate between lawyers and journalists over codifying standards of journalistic ethics; societal reverberations of stereotyping in terms of politics, gender, race, etc.; ethical considerations in the setting of the news agenda; yellow journalism then and now; implications of corporate giantism in media ownership on journalism; the ethical perils of \u201cbeat\u201d reporting; uses and abuses of staging and dramatic reenactments.\n\nThe larger force at work here is the instinct to complicate. Those who run, and attend, schools of journalism simply cannot\u2014or don\u2019t want to\u2014believe that journalism is as simple as it is. The textbooks, the jargon, the spell checkers\u2014the entire pretentious science of journalism only distract from the journalist\u2019s task: to observe, to question, to read and to write about subjects other than journalism. They have less to do with writing journalism than avoiding having to write journalism at all.\n\nIt turns out that I am not alone in this view. Despite ninety years of saturation marketing\u2014there are now 414 American schools and departments of journalism, containing 150,000 students\u2014the trade has somehow sustained a robust contempt for the credential. Though journalism schools promise that they will find jobs for their graduates\u2014indeed, the entire enterprise is based on the premise that a journalism school degree translates into a desk in the newsroom\u2014many of the people who currently occupy those desks don\u2019t want to have anything to do with them.\n\n\u201cWhenever I hear someone went to journalism school I immediately assume they are inferior in one way or another,\u201d says Joel Achenbach, who writes the \u201cWhy Things Are\u201d column for The Washington Post. \u201cAll we do is ask questions and type and occasionally turn a phrase. Why do you need to go to school for that?\u201d Post editor Katherine Boo agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s just a huge hoax,\u201d she says. \u201cI think how you become a journalist is that you write. You don\u2019t see any correlation between journalistic education and an ability to write a story. When you get a great piece, and you call the person to see who he is, he never says, \u2018Oh I just came from journalism school.\u2019\u201d\n\nEven among working journalists who themselves went to journalism school, praise is not always forthcoming. \u201cThere is nothing I regret more,\u201d says Joseph Nocera, who spent two years at the journalism school at Boston University and now writes widely. \u201cTwo years that could have been spent actually learning something were instead spent at a glorified trade school\u2014I still recall with a shudder the two weeks spent learning how to write an obit\u2014except that this trade school cannot possibly teach you what you need to learn, because it is impossible to re-create the journalism environment in the classroom.\u201d\n\nThe people who do the hiring in the newsrooms echo these sentiments. \u201cA journalism degree doesn\u2019t really carry much weight,\u201d says Jeanne Fox-Alston, the Post\u2019s newsroom recruiting director. \u201cIn fact, we are a little bit concerned when we see that someone has taken a lot of journalism classes.\u201d \u201cIf you can write, then you can figure out how to write journalism,\u201d says Peter Kovaks, the Metro editor for the New Orleans Times-Picayune. The headhunters at The New York Times put it even more bluntly. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t pull any weight,\u201d says a staffer who works for Carolyn Lee, the assistant managing editor in charge of hiring at the Times. \u201cAll we care about is ability and experience.\u201d\n\nOne could go on. When Dean Isaacs worked for The Washington Post, he himself used to discriminate against the people he now instructs. \u201cI stopped hiring people from the Columbia Journalism School,\u201d he says. \u201cThey thought their shit didn\u2019t smell. They were a constant morale problem.\u201d Now that he\u2019s at the school, however, he says he understands the value of a journalism degree. \u201cIt teaches you a way of thinking.\u201d\n\nJournalism schools, of course, balk at being balked at. Last fall Columbia\u2019s placement director boasted to students that 45 percent of the class of 1992 had found jobs or internships in journalism. Perhaps, but to appreciate that figure fully you must know that 50 percent of the class came to the school from full-time jobs in journalism. Another 20 percent had internships. Assuming the numbers provided by Columbia students and faculty are accurate, the journalism school redirected 25 percent of the class of 1992 into other occupations.\n\nAnd the students, it would appear, are beginning to catch on. The evaluations filled out by the journalism students before last year\u2019s graduation underscore the problem. Of course, there were a number of satisfied customers\u2014\u201cExcellent! I want to be an active alumnus\u201d\u2014as you would expect from an institution that bestows an award, prize or fellowship upon one in eight of its graduates. And a pair of untenured professors seem to touch their students profoundly: Samuel Freedman, who teaches a course in book writing, and Richard Blood, who teaches basic reporting but puts his fifteen students through a life-changingly rigorous program more like boot camp. (He also happens to believe that the school lacks any real standards: \u201cThere aren\u2019t three or four of my colleagues who have any business being here,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019ll be kind. I\u2019ll say half a dozen.\u201d)\n\nBut many more of the students seem to have peered into their futures with dismay. Here\u2019s a small sample of the evaluations: \u201cI am totally disappointed with the whole program.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t believe I paid this much money [tuition at the Columbia program is $18,000] to come here and I can\u2019t get help finding a job.\u201d \u201cThe placement office was something of a joke, as there were only two or three recruiters who came, most from very specialized journalism (i.e., Baseball Weekly).\u201d \u201cThe J-school is a farce. The emperor has no clothes.\u201d \u201cI find it outrageous that the placement director left in October and students were never formally notified a) that she was gone or b) about progress in the search for a replacement. We are adults who are paying your salaries ...\u201d And so on.\n\nIn the absence of optimistic placement statistics the authorities at Columbia offer a more elaborate explanation of the benefits of their journalism degree: it may not help you right away, but it will help you down the road. \u201cI spent a lot of the time telling people that no, no one is going to make you a foreign correspondent and send you abroad next year,\u201d says Judith Serrin, the placement director who left Columbia a year and a half ago. \u201cWhat I used to say is that people who are out five years make these jumps.\u201d The school seems to have settled on this story. Seven students and two professors cited the figure for me, unsolicited. Five years. Big jump. The belief in mysterious yet imminent career jumps has the advantage of being impossible to disprove without the benefit of a team of researchers. Enough able, driven people pass through Columbia and proceed to greater glory to sustain the myth. The question, impossible to answer, is whether they would have made the big jump on their own anyway\n\nExplanations for the big jump vary, but the consensus among the students is that it happens because of personal connections. \u201cThe majority of the people who come out of here and get jobs move up the ladder very quickly because of the network,\u201d says a student named Ron Spingarn. \u201cThey know the right people.\u201d Says another student: \u201cThey say the connections you make here are worth the money.\u201d Pressed on how this happens, she says, \u201cThere is an amazing Ivy League door-opening thing that goes on when you mention Columbia.\u201d One of her classmates, a scholarship student, adds, \u201cIt\u2019s not what your grades are. It\u2019s who do you know. What professors do you know?\u201d The frenzy of student networking is apparent, especially to the faculty. \u201cWhen I went up there to teach,\u201d says a reporter for The New York Times, \u201cit was clear to me that the main reason [people attended] was that the students wanted to meet someone who worked at The New York Times.\u201d\n\nA few weeks ago, toward the end of the first semester of classes, about thirty journalism students assembled in the third-floor student lounge to compile a list of complaints about the school, which they eventually presented to Dean Joan Konner. They were busily agreeing that the school needed more Hispanics, more scholarship money for African Americans, a more culturally sensitive faculty and more awareness about AIDS, when a stranger crept in and took a seat. The stranger must have liked what he saw: all these prosperous-looking youths so preoccupied with their problems that they were blind to the events right in front of their eyes. Unnoticed, the stranger rifled through a student\u2019s purse. The lounge wasn\u2019t much bigger than a squash court, so he deserves some sort of prize for audacity.\n\nIt was only when the stranger made for the door that one of the students\u2014the woman who\u2019d been robbed\u2014finally noticed him and shouted. The stranger raced out the door, down the stairwell, past the bronze plaque, past the bronze busts of Joseph Pulitzer, past the stucco reliefs of the Gods of Journalism and out into the night, chased by a dozen or so less swift journalism students. Standing near the fateful spot in the lounge where she and her classmates had been sitting, Kaue Noel Kelch-Mattox related the story to me. \u201cWe were literally ten to fifteen seconds behind him, but then he just disappeared,\u201d she said. \u201cI never would have thought this sort of thing could happen in my own student lounge.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho wrote the story?\u201d I asked. The students were required to hand in homework articles each week. The student newspaper was also sorely in need of material.\n\n\u201cNo one,\u201d she said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a story.\u201d\n\nAs I pulled out a pad and began to write, students in the lounge gathered around me, along with a pair of young adjunct professors.\n\n\u201cOh, here comes the notebook!\u201d said one, sounding very media wise.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your nut graph?\u201d asked the other, who was keen to know how this article was going to turn out. I scribbled a note to check the meaning of the phrase, one of the several bits of J-school jargon I failed to understand.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to the wallet?\u201d I asked my source.\n\n\u201cWhy are you trying to find out?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just curious.\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.\u201d She looked relieved. \u201cThen there\u2019s not a story.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said one of the other students, a little aggressively. \u201cIt\u2019s just normal here. I keep mugger money in one pocket and my money in the other.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d said the media-wise professor, \u201cwhat you\u2019re going to see in this article is a completely skewed position on the crime problem in the school.\u201d\n\nThe women telling the tale began to lecture me. \u201cSo, like, just because someone had their purse stolen is proof that there is something wrong with our school?\u201d\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d said the other professor, \u201ctell us your nut graph.\u201d\n\nI gave up and dropped the pad. \u201cWhat\u2019s a nut graph?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what a nut graph is!\u201d someone shouted.\n\nThe adjunct professor took pity. He tried again, gently. \u201cIn the article you are writing about the school,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s your null hypothesis?\u201d\n\nMy null hypothesis?\n\nMy null hypothesis! My angle. My bias. My take. My ... point ... of ... view!\n\n\u201cMy null hypothesis,\u201d I said, \u201cis that the Columbia Journalism School is all bullshit.\u201d\n\nThey paused. \u201cThat\u2019s a good null hypothesis,\u201d said one, finally.\n\nJournalism schools are not alone in their attempts to dignify a trade by tacking onto it the idea of professionalism and laying over it a body of dubious theory. After all, McDonald\u2019s Hamburger U. now trains Beverage Technicians. But the journalist\u2019s role is precisely to cut through this sort of obfuscation, not to create more of it. The best journalists are almost the antithesis of professionals. The horror of disrepute, the preternatural respect for authority and the fear of controversy that so benefit the professional are absolute handicaps for a journalist. I doff my cap to those who have survived the experience of journalism school and still write good journalism. They deserve every Distinguished Alumni Award they receive, and more.\n\nThe first sentence on the bronze plaque that you see when you walk through the front door of the Columbia Journalism School may or may not be true, but it sets a fittingly autocratic, unreflective tone. The second sentence is ungrammatical. The last two sentences offer the sort of grandiose vision of journalism entertained mainly by retired journalists or those assigned to deliver speeches before handing out journalism awards. Highly flattering to all of us, of course, but it would be more true to flip the statement to read: \u201ca cynical, mercenary, demagogic people will produce in time a press as base as itself ...\u201d There\u2019s also a small problem: when the journalism school cemented the bronze plaque on the wall in 1962, to commemorate its fiftieth anniversary, it misquoted the text as it appeared in its final, pamphlet form. Those nits! The details! Flaubert! A word of Joseph Pulitzer\u2019s is missing, between demagogic and press. The word is CORRUPT.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the April 18, 1993 issue of magazine."

    "title": "Carolee Schneemann Finally Gets Her Due",
    "authors": [
      "Jillian Steinhauer"
    ],
    "text": "Around that time, Schneemann became involved in New York City\u2019s experimental downtown scene. She began making performances that she called \u201ckinetic theater\u201d\u2014scored events for groups of performers that fell somewhere between dance, theater, and happenings. The most famous of these is Meat Joy (1964), a quasi-orgiastic ritual in which nine performers undressed and carried out a series of actions with rope, paint, papers, plastic sheets, as well as raw chickens, mackerel, and hot dogs. One of the biggest challenges of curating past performance works is conveying their power with only documentation to show. But the video of Meat Joy remains stirring. There\u2019s something undeniably discomfiting about watching near-naked performers roll around and rub raw chickens all over their bodies, and in our day and age, any image that creates discomfort without the use of violence seems worth lingering on.\n\nWhat does get lost, somewhat, is the cultural and political context in which such a performance took place (an issue that could be addressed with better wall text). It can be tempting today to dismiss Meat Joy as a formless act of empty hedonism, but Schneemann rigorously orchestrated it, and she did her other performances, through the use of drawings, which are on display, and a score, which is included in the catalogue. She was exploring aesthetic possibilities and cultural taboos. (Meat Joy apparently so tested taboos that a man tried to strangle Schneemann during its 1964 Paris premiere.) \u201cThe cultural surround intensifying my sensuous rituals was motivated in contrast to the endless brutalities of the Vietnam War,\u201d Schneemann wrote. \u201cMy propositions of ecstatic connection were in reaction to a government shaped by assassinations and militaristic aggressions.\u201d\n\nSchneemann tackled the Vietnam War head-on in a 1965 film titled Viet-Flakes and a 1967 performance called Snows, which used the former as its \u201cheart and core,\u201d she wrote. In Viet-Flakes a camera zooms in and out on suppressed images of atrocities from the war, set to a soundtrack of cut-up American pop songs and Vietnamese music. It feels a bit too much like a formal exercise to be potent. Snows featured an elaborate set, fake snow, five films projected in 360 degrees, and performers who enacted a series of physically intense actions that included falling, crawling, and grabbing and dragging each other\u2019s bodies. It seems to have been a kind of Gesamtkunstwerk of suffering. Unfortunately, at MoMA PS1 its intensity doesn\u2019t come through, perhaps because video documentation flattens the complex layering of media it contained live.\n\nSchneemann has continued to make work about wars and suffering over the decades\u2014what she calls her \u201catrocity collection\u201d\u2014including an artist\u2019s book, collages, and more pieces about the 1982 Lebanon War; a series of enlarged images of newspaper photographs of people falling from the Twin Towers on 9/11; and an installation titled More Wrong Things (2000), which consists of TV screens arrayed at different heights and connected by a web of dangling wires. The TVs juxtapose graphic images of political violence with mundane ones from Schneemann\u2019s life\u2014a common technique throughout her oeuvre that doesn\u2019t serve her well. Though it suggests an admirable honesty, an admission that she\u2019s only experiencing these conflicts at a remove, it also centers her in a way that compounds the problem of her atrocity works: They feel lacking in a deep engagement with the sociopolitical realities represented by the images they contain.\n\n\n\n\u201cMeat Joy\u201d by Carolee Schneemann Al Giese / Courtesy of Carolee Schneemann, P.P.O.W, and Galerie Lelong, New York\n\nFar more successful are what Schneemann calls her \u201cworks of pleasure\u201d\u2014pieces like Meat Joy and Fuses (1964\u201367), a half-hour-long, silent collage film of Schneemann and her then partner and collaborator, James Tenney, making love. Medium-range shots of the couple having sex are interspersed with close-ups of their genitals and, sometimes, the view out of a window or Schneemann\u2019s cat watching the action. The images are provocative, but also tender and bracing. Meanwhile the film shifts from red to purple to bright turquoise or appears scratched or upside-side down, reminding the viewer that this is not a simple documentary; Schneemann shaped the work by burning, baking, cutting, painting, and collaging the film. At MoMA PS1, the installation of Fuses in a small, dark room with theater seats conjures a feeling of illicitness, the thrill of an adult movie theater, but the film is remarkable for the unabashedness of its eroticism and experimentation.\n\n\n\nSchneemann\u2019s frank willingness to explore both the liberation and limitations of bodily experience is her greatest strength. In Up to and Including Her Limits (1973\u201376), she combined it with her roots in painting to create a solo performance in which she hung naked in a harness and drew with crayons on the walls and floors around her. Her brilliant Sexual Parameters Charts (1969\u201375) catalogue women\u2019s assessments of their sexual experiences with men, surveying everything from partners\u2019 body temperatures to genital sizes and use of words. In her lecture-performance Vulva\u2019s Morphia (1995), Schneemann delivers a caustically funny storybook tale of vulva\u2019s journey to understand how the culture perceives her (\u201cVulva goes to school and discovers she doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d it begins.) Schneemann doesn\u2019t even confine her investigations to the human body: The photographs in her Infinity Kisses series show grainy, washed-out, often unflattering images of the \u201cdeep kisses\u201d delivered to her every morning by her cats. The pictures are so intimate they\u2019re almost alienating; they force us to reconcile the aversion they evoke in the viewer with the love they represent for the artist.\n\nThe Infinity Kisses series are important because they represent Schneemann\u2019s continued engagement with the realities of her physical life as she\u2019s gotten older. This helps offset a quandary that comes up while viewing the exhibition: although Schneemann\u2019s bodily experiments were so groundbreaking they got her shunned, they also were likely only possible because she was young, thin, and white. Schneemann is aware of this: she recently told Dazed Digital, \u201cYou had to be attractive, or they would laugh you off your page. \u2026 being attractive gave us the possibility of subverting the meanings of our bodies as they were predetermined by male culture.\u201d To that end, it\u2019s a shame Kinetic Painting doesn\u2019t include another, rarely seen work that was exhibited last year at P.P.O.W. gallery: Known/Unknown: Plague Column (1995\u201396), a multimedia installation about Schneemann\u2019s treatment for breast cancer. Among other items, the work contains collaged images and texts about a historical Viennese \u201cplague column,\u201d sculptures of breast implants, and videos of mammograms and amateur porn.\n\nThe argument underlying Kinetic Painting is that, for all of her performances, assemblages, films, kinetic sculptures, photographs, and more, Schneemann has remained at heart a painter. This idea comes from Schneemann herself, and it\u2019s not hard to understand why she insists on it: women\u2019s work is all too often dismissed, as she emphasized in Interior Scroll, for \u201cthe personal clutter\u201d and \u201cthe persistence of feelings.\u201d Schneemann knows her art history; she knows that the way to be taken seriously is to be understood as a formalist. And to the men who\u2019ve long written the textbooks, curated the museum shows, and collected the artworks, being a formalist who\u2019s also a woman who takes off her clothes to make art with her body is just not possible. And so, painter it is.\n\nYet if there\u2019s one current running through Kinetic Painting\u2014which is not arranged chronologically and sometimes feels jumbled\u2014it\u2019s not painting but the body. The body idolized and brutalized; the body stretched and abstracted, repressed and reimagined. This is where Schneemann\u2019s feminist art springs from: an insistence on knowing and representing herself. In a society still hell bent on controlling women\u2019s bodies, that remains all too radical."

    "text": "The seven Labour MPs who resigned from the party on February 18 cited anti-Semitism within the Labour party and a lack of trust in leader Jeremy Corbyn, especially when it comes to handling Brexit, as their reasons for leaving. An eighth Labour MP joined the following day. A few days later, three Conservative MPs made their own break, citing the hijacking of the Conservative party by hard-right elements, Theresa May\u2019s failure to modernize the party, and the reckless handling of Brexit.\n\nSmall, narrowly focused parties have a history of successful issue advocacy, if not necessarily long-term parliamentary success. Beyond UKIP\u2019s role in the Brexit vote there is the example of Germany\u2019s Green party, which though founded as an irreverent activist party, went on to gain parliamentary representation, exerting tremendous sway on politics in the 1980s: The Greens are currently absorbing voters from the decaying center-left and center-right governing parties. The Dutch Party for the Animals, PvdP, even with limited parliamentary representation, has also been able to guide the animal welfare policies of mainstream parties, given its ability to absorb voters from both sides of the political spectrum.\n\nWhether The Independent Group can do something similar is debatable. The group\u2019s statement promises \u201cevidence-based\u201d policies that reach beyond traditional divisions in pursuit of the national interest. A list of similarly anodyne declarations follows. \u201cThe barriers of poverty, prejudice and discrimination facing individuals should be removed and advancement occur on the basis of merit,\u201d one proclamation begins. One would be hard-pressed to find MPs from any party that disagree.\n\nA certain vagueness is perhaps to be expected from a group composed of both center-left and center-right politicians. And perhaps there is a gap in the U.K.\u2019s political market for such a centrist party. A familiar narrative since the 2016 referendum has been that both main parties, Labour and the Conservatives, have been drifting to the wings, leaving a large portion of the electorate feeling unrepresented and without a viable alternative. Others feel poorly represented due to the fact that, even though 48 percent of the electorate voted to Remain in the EU, both major parties have committed to Brexit. The Liberal Democrats, who would have been the obvious go-to middle-ground, pro-EU party, have been unattractive to center-left voters, their brand seriously damaged in the years it governed in coalition with the Conservatives, enabling austerity measures and the tripling of university fees. Center-right voters have also been reluctant to cast their vote to the Liberal Democrats, for fear of aiding Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s ascent to power, given how close the race between Labour and the Conservatives is in many districts, and the UK\u2019s \u201cfirst past the post\u201d electoral system.\n\nThe prospect of a new center party has surfaced before, particularly in the spring of 2018, when a fund of \u00a350 million was said to have been raised by entrepreneurs, and philanthropists with the aim to \u201cbreak the Westminster mould.\u201d Those plans never materialized, but TIG now seems like the product of similar machinations. Some have argued this could be Britain\u2019s Macron moment, referring to the rise of Emanuel Macron in France, where a group of political entrepreneurs created a new force that quickly won support. (TIG is already polling at 14 to 18 percent.) Others, however, see the group as the dying whimpers of centrist politics that\u2019s had its day. After all, the U.K. already had its Macron: His name was Tony Blair."

    "text": "Rosenfeld, Harris, and others are on firmer ground in arguing that some criticisms of Israel itself are anti-Semitic. Some European and Middle Eastern commentators simply identify Jews with Israelis and ascribe to \u201cIsraelis\u201d the same kinds of evil conspiracies that they would have earlier attributed to \u201cJews\u201d\u2014for instance, secretly blowing up the World Trade Center while letting the blame for the deed fall on Islamic radicals, or infecting Arabs with AIDS. But what also bothers the critics of the new anti-Semitism are Jewish intellectuals like Judt, Kushner, or poet Adrienne Rich, all of whom harshly criticize the Israeli state, compare its policies in the occupied territories to South Africa\u2019s in the Bantustans or even Hitler\u2019s in Germany, call for a secular democratic state, or criticize Zionism itself. These kinds of views, Rosenfeld writes, \u201crecall older versions of anti-Semitism.\u201d\n\nBut the harsh denunciation of Israeli policies can be offensive without being anti-Semitic. It\u2019s not uncommon in political argument to dredge up past evils to dramatize what are believed to be present ones. American administrations constantly evoke Hitler and the Nazis to characterize their current enemies. Indeed, Rosenfeld et al. are engaged in the same kind of hyped rhetoric when they identify Walt and Mearsheimer with David Duke or with Nazis, or when, like the American Jewish Committee\u2019s David Harris, they equate Walt and Mearsheimer\u2019s views with those of people who imagine \u201cJews as inoculators of AIDS in the Arab world or contaminators of Palestinian water sources.\u201d\n\nThe same can be said of Judt\u2019s argument for a democratic secular state or for arguments against Zionism itself. These have been, and should remain, arguable subjects among Jews as well as non-Jews. As Rosenfeld acknowledges, many of these arguments can be found in Israel itself. For instance, in Bernard Avishai\u2019s important book, The Tragedy of Zionism, published in 2002, he argued that the \u201cromance of Zionism harmed\u2014and may yet wreck\u2014[Israel\u2019s] chances to survive as a democracy.\u201d If anything, Judt\u2019s position for a secular democratic state is utopian. It hopes for too much. But, in its folly, it also reflects the same universalist tradition in Jewish thought that contributed to American Jewish support for civil rights. In other words, it might be foolish to think that Jews and Palestinians could coexist in the same state, but it\u2019s not anti-Semitic.\n\nThere is a paradox that haunts these charges of anti-Semitism. On the one hand, Rosenfeld, Harris, and others want to deny that American Jews and American Jewish organizations like AIPAC suffer from dual loyalty in trying to influence U.S. foreign policy. It\u2019s anti-Semitic or contributes to anti-Semitism, they say, to make that charge. On the other hand, they want to demand of American Jewish intellectuals a certain loyalty to Israel, Israeli policies, and to Zionism as part of their being Jewish. They make dual loyalty an inescapable part of being Jewish in a world in which a Jewish state exists. And that\u2019s probably the case. Many Jews now suffer from dual loyalty\u2014the same way that Cuban-Americans or Mexican-Americans do. By ignoring this dilemma\u2014and, worse still, by charging those who acknowledge its existence with anti-Semitism\u2014the critics of the new anti-Semitism are engaged in a flight from their own political selves. They are guilty of a certain kind of bad faith.\n\nThese controversies over anti-Semitism come, too, at a predictable and particularly unfortunate time in the discussion of U.S. foreign policy. The last time a similar brouhaha arose was in the 1970s, when Jewish peace organizations in the United States challenged Israel\u2019s occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. At the urging of the Israeli government, organizations like Breira were run out of town by their traditional, and more subservient, brethren. Partly as a result, the United States acquiesced in Israeli policies that, in the long run, have benefited neither the United States nor Israel. The same thing could happen again. A debate has already begun over U.S. policy toward Iran in which AIPAC and the Israeli government have expressed interest in the United States stopping at nothing to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Fears of a new Holocaust\u2014made more plausible by the very real anti-Semitism of Iran\u2019s president\u2014have been sounded. What policies are in the interest of the United States? And of Israel? These are difficult questions, but they are not made easier to answer when critics of Israel and of the Israel lobby in the United States are charged with anti-Semitism."

    "text": "With all the shouting it was easy to miss, but something new happened in Washington this week. If you can\u2019t see it yet, put yourself back in 2006, when everything about a Somali-American, Muslim congresswoman tweeting a line from a Puff Daddy song\u2014as Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar did Sunday evening\u2014would have been unthinkable.\n\nIn March 2006, two established, neo-realist foreign policy wonks named John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt published an article in the London Review of Books. They argued that outsized U.S. support for Israel, which receives more U.S. military aid than any other country on the planet, made little sense in a post\u2013Cold War context in which Israel was no longer a \u201cvital strategic asset.\u201d Mearsheimer and Walt attributed the irrational persistence of this policy to highly effective lobbying efforts \u201cto steer US foreign policy in a pro-Israel direction.\u201d The Israel Lobby, as they called it, was not a cabal or a conspiracy, but something altogether ordinary in Washington, like the gun lobby or the steel lobby: a \u201cloose coalition of individuals and organizations\u201d encompassing Christian evangelicals, neo-conservatives, and the powerful America Israel Public Affairs Committee, whose support or opposition could make or break a candidate. \u201cThe bottom line,\u201d they wrote, \u201cis that AIPAC, a de facto agent for a foreign government, has a stranglehold on Congress, with the result that U.S. policy towards Israel is not debated there.\u201d\n\nTo almost anyone with experience in American electoral politics, Mearsheimer and Walt were stating the obvious: The near unanimity of politicians\u2019 support for Israel resulted not from inborn Zionist sympathies, but rather organizing and influence\u2014which in Washington invariably involves money. The uproar was nonetheless fierce. Pundits lined up to get their kicks in. Jeffrey Goldberg, writing in The Atlantic, called the two authors \u201cneo-Lindberghians\u201d and characterized Walt as a \u201cgrubby Jew-baiter\u201d who \u201cmakes his living scapegoating Jews.\u201d David Rothkopf, in Foreign Policy, was only slightly more generous: While Mearsheimer and Walt \u201cmay not be anti-Semites themselves,\u201d he allowed, \u201cthey made a cynical decision to cash in on anti-Semitism.\u201d Jonathan Chait went after them repeatedly in the pages of The New Republic, dismissing their views as \u201csimply kooky.\u201d\n\nBy the time Ilhan Omar walked onto the national stage, a lot had changed, and not much at all. Since 2006, we\u2019ve seen three devastating and overwhelmingly one-sided Israeli assaults on Gaza, the massive expansion of settlements in a brutal and seemingly endless occupation, the collapse of U.S.-sponsored peace negotiations and anything that could be called an Israeli \u201cleft,\u201d a widening gulf between Israeli and American Jews, and an Israeli prime minister who went out of his way to embarrass a popular Democratic president and to embrace the neo-fascist right. Ever-larger cracks are appearing in the defensive wall the U.S. media has for years erected around Israel: Critical voices\u2014even Palestinian ones\u2014are increasingly making it into the op-ed pages. Space for debate is finally opening up. And the controversy that blew up around Omar is a foretaste of how bitterly that space will be contested."

    "text": "When society becomes more secular, those limits on capitalist striving disappear. At that point, the capitalist spirit becomes \u201cunbridled\u201d and, in Weber\u2019s words, \u201cthe pursuit of wealth, divested of its metaphysical significance, today tends to be associated with purely elemental passions, which at times virtually turn it into a sporting contest.\u201d This is an uncannily accurate picture of the work-obsessed mind in twenty-first century America. To Thompson, work is at best a form of play; at worst, \u201cIt is a diabolical game that creates a prize so tantalizing yet rare that almost nobody wins, but everybody feels obligated to play forever.\u201d \u00ad\u00ad\n\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. Citing the English Puritan theologian Richard Baxter, Weber wrote that the systematic drive to produce wealth was meant to be \u201clike a thin cloak which can be thrown off at any time.\u201d You work hard when you need to, but you can stop anytime, for God\u2019s sake or otherwise. Your work doesn\u2019t change who you are. \u201cBut fate decreed that the cloak should become an iron cage,\u201d Weber wrote. We ended up stuck with the ethic the Puritans developed, even after we stopped believing in predestination.\n\nThe Harvard Business School alumnus who told Duhigg he was wasting his life added, \u201cIf you spend 12 hours a day doing work you hate, at some point it doesn\u2019t matter what your paycheck says.\u201d (This man\u2019s paycheck says $1.2 million a year.) \u201cHe had received an offer at a start-up, and he would have loved to take it,\u201d Duhigg wrote, \u201cbut it paid half as much, and he felt locked into a lifestyle that made this pay cut impossible.\u201d The iron cage is lined in velvet.\n\nShould we even care if well-educated, well-off workers are unhappy with their jobs? Aren\u2019t other workers\u2014like the millions who don\u2019t even get a living wage\u2014suffering in more immediate ways? While millionaire stock traders complain about the meaninglessness of their work, there are a thousand people in Phoenix going through repeated emotional trauma at work to keep videos of murder and violent sex off of Facebook, as Casey Newton recently reported for The Verge. To get through the day, employees of Cognizant, which contracts with the social media giants, have sex in the stairwells and smoke pot during breaks. They become paranoid; one brought a handgun to the office, fearing disgruntled former employees. All this, and they earn less than $30,000 a year.\n\nElite attitudes toward work have disproportionate impact, though. Weber\u2019s study observed that in Germany, Protestants tended to occupy the capitalist class; laborers were more often Catholic. In his eyes, culture changes from the top down. That\u2019s true in our age, too. The \u201cdo what you love\u201d ethos that began with the creative class has become a norm for house cleaners and supermarket cashiers, as Miya Tokumitsu has shown.\n\nIf we saw work less as a way to prove one\u2019s worth, we might value it more as an economic endeavor.\n\nIf we saw work less as a way to prove one\u2019s worth or moral virtue, or a place to find \u201cmeaning,\u201d then we might begin to value it more as an economic endeavor. And if the people who are drawing great material benefit from our work culture also hate it, then maybe they will feel moved to use their economic and political power to change it for the better. To do so, elite workers can look once again to the religions that once kept capitalism in check. American Protestantism may have gotten us into our current work obsession, but it and other religions\u2014their practices adapted, perhaps, to secular tastes\u2014also offer a way out.\n\nTheology puts work in a cosmic perspective. In the book of Genesis, labor is a consequence of human sin, not a means to prove human righteousness. Even God rests from work on the seventh day. When Jesus calls his followers, he pulls them away from their ordinary jobs as fishermen and tax collectors. He teaches them to \u201clook at the birds of the air; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?\u201d He heaps woe upon the rich and shows favor to the idle poor.\n\nReligious observance interrupts the workday or workweek. For most Muslims, prayer is obligatory five times a day, which usually requires breaks from work. (Newton reported that Muslim workers at Cognizant complained they were not allowed to pray during the nine minutes of \u201cwellness time\u201d the company allows per day.) The Jewish Torah prohibits working on the Sabbath, which the rabbi and activist Abraham Joshua Heschel has described as the person\u2019s break from \u201cthe betrayal in embezzling his own life\u201d during the workweek. To enter into the Sabbath, he wrote, someone \u201cmust say farewell to manual work and learn to understand that the world has already been created and will survive without the help of\u201d human labor.\n\nYou don\u2019t necessarily have to go to church or mosque or synagogue to put rituals like this in place. It\u2019s possible to create secular versions of them. You could treat the weekend for the purpose that the labor movement intended, as two consecutive work-free days. You could even submit to an ascetical regimen to free yourself from the yoke of work. New York Times business columnist Kevin Roose recently underwent a 30-day tech detox, which included a weekend retreat to the Catskills without his phone. He was frustrated at times. \u201cBut mostly, it was great,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFor two solid days, I basked in 19th-century leisure, feeling my nerves softening and my attention span stretching out.\u201d He now has the zeal of a convert: \u201cYou have to try it.\u201d\n\nBut countercultural rituals don\u2019t work as well if you\u2019re attempting them alone. Without a community to share them with, you\u2019re just that one coworker who\u2019s not up to speed, or that weird friend whom no one can get a hold of on the weekend. Regardless of the practice you undertake, something other than work needs to be sacred, so that your job can be profane. If Americans can learn to think of work in less lofty terms, then we might begin to appreciate its material value\u2014wages, benefits, time off, pensions\u2014and lessen the agony it brings. Together, we can find more fulfilling ways to spend our lives."

    "text": "Republicans on the committee weren\u2019t particularly interested in any of that, aside from lone dissenter Representative Scot Turner, who decried the GOP\u2019s support for \u201cwasting $150 million.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would not have mattered if we\u2019d shown up with two stone tablets in the House, decreeing that the Lord wanted paper ballots,\u201d said Marilyn Marks, head of the Coalition for Good Governance, a leading proponent of paper balloting. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have heard.\u201d\n\nWhy are Kemp and friends in such a hurry to spend so much unnecessary money? Both McClatchy and The New Yorker have provided some pretty juicy clues. Kemp\u2019s deputy chief of staff, former state Representative Chuck Harper, is a former lobbyist for ES&S, the odds-on favorite to win the Georgia contract if the $150 million is approved. Another, David Dove, was on the company\u2019s board of advisers, and thus had long been enjoying the perks that ES&S offers to elections officials around the country\u2014\u201cairfare on trips to places like Las Vegas and New York, upscale-hotel accommodations, and tickets to live events,\u201d as Sue Halpern wrote in The New Yorker. She later added a pertinent detail: \u201cIn March 2017, when [Dove] attended an ES&S junket in Las Vegas, Kemp\u2019s office was in the market to replace the state\u2019s entire inventory of voting machines.\u201d Dove was Secretary Kemp\u2019s chief of staff at the time; now he\u2019s Governor Kemp\u2019s executive counsel.\n\n\u201cPrevious work as a lobbyist is not a disqualifier for public service,\u201d Kemp\u2019s office told the Atlanta-Journal Constitution. \u201cPeople should not bend the facts to suit a narrative. Mr. Harper and Mr. Dove are men of integrity. They followed the law. They will continue to do so.\u201d\n\nBack when Georgia first fell for it, shortly after the Florida fiasco of 2000, electronic voting seemed like the wave of the future. But as cybersecurity threats have metastasized in recent cycles, most states and localities have retired the machines (except for voters unable to mark paper ballots) and gone back to plain old reliable, recountable paper. Not Georgia, though. Or key battleground areas like Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Johnson County, Kansas; and Franklin County, Ohio. All of them have recently purchased ballot-marking machines.\n\nGiven the heightened awareness of election-security threats after 2016, it might seem downright odd that anybody is forking out the money for these machines. But some local elections officials say they prefer them\u2014sometimes because they\u2019ve been wined-and-dined by the vendors (as 18 county elections officials in Pennsylvania were recently outed as doing), sometimes because they think the touchscreen machines will make things easier. Paper ballots have to be printed and distributed, after all, then audited and counted. With ES&S\u2019s ExpressVote, the county may have to buy expensive, specialized paper for the machines, but on Election Day, that paper is sent off into electronic purgatory via the machines. No muss, no fuss, no clean-up for elections workers. Also, no verifiability.\n\nThe touchscreen manufacturers also claim that their machines make voting go faster, resulting in shorter waits to cast a ballot\u2014and fewer voters who give up and leave without voting. In fact, the opposite has proven true. In the only state to use ballot-marking devices en masse in 2018, Maryland, county officials reported that lines were longer than ever, especially during peak voting hours. The reason is pretty obvious: Lots of people can fill out their hand ballots at the same time, as opposed to waiting to use the limited number of machines available.\n\nAnd unlike filling in bubbles on a sheet of paper, ExpressVote is anything but intuitive to use, as this demonstration video from Johnson County, Kansas\u2014a real treat for fans of 1950s instructional films!\u2014makes clumsily clear:\n\nThe multiple steps required of a voter and machine attendant take six minutes just to explain.\n\nFair-elections activists, cybersecurity folks, and regular citizens in Georgia\u2014the ones who\u2019ve caught on to what\u2019s happening, that is\u2014are appropriately outraged by the idea of spending so much money for vulnerable technology. The group Stacey Abrams founded after the midterms, Fair Fight Action, has run TV and radio ads to stir up opposition. \u201cThose faulty machines\u2014the ones that could get hacked to steal our vote\u2014Governor Kemp wants to spend $150 million of our taxpayer dollars to buy more,\u201d says the TV ad, which mentions that Kemp hired ES&S\u2019s former lobbyist.\n\nBut the governor and his allies are betting that they can get the bill through the legislature before it becomes a political albatross. To grease the wheels, Kemp\u2019s successor as secretary of state, former GOP House member Brad Raffensperger, has been spreading disinformation. To combat the reporting about the excessive cost of the touchscreen machines, his office produced an analysis of what it\u2019ll cost to use paper ballots over the next decade\u2014$244 million, it claims.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s an apples-and-oranges comparison\u2014an initial cost versus a 10-year cost\u2014and activists say that Raffensperger inflated the cost of paper and the amount of paper that would be required for hand-balloting. Two conservative groups, the National Election Defense Coalition and FreedomWorks, called the voting-machine deal a \u201cboondoggle\u201d in a letter last week to state Senate Republicans. \u201cThe Secretary of State is circulating a cost analysis that is profoundly misleading and wildly inflates the costs of conducting elections with hand-marked paper ballots,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe Secretary\u2019s analysis is like comparing the cost of buying a Chevrolet \u2014 plus insurance, gas and repairs for ten years \u2014 to the cost of \u2026 buying a Bentley and then trying to insist the Bentley is cheaper.\u201d\n\nInterviewed last week by Georgia Public Broadcasting, Raffensperger shrugged off the naysayers, saying, \u201cthere\u2019s always going to be people who want to pick a fight.\u201d He chalked up any opposition to partisan politics and outside agitators: \u201cI guess the national Democrats and national liberal organizations want hand-marked paper ballots; they don\u2019t get that, then they\u2019re going to stomp their feet.\u201d\n\nOutside Georgia, conservatives tend to be anything but gung-ho about electronic voting methods. One of Congress\u2019s leading advocates for paper ballots is none other than Freedom Caucus chair Mark Meadows, who floated the Paper Act last year, which would have offered financial incentives to states and municipalities who set aside their machines for paper ballots. Anti-tax guru Grover Norquist and former Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff wrote a widely circulated op-ed supporting paper ballots as the best defense against cybersecurity threats.\n\nMost of the country\u2019s elections officials are listening. But in Georgia, the lobbying efforts of voting-machine vendors appear to be paying off in spectacular fashion. Unless Congress forces everyone to use paper ballots\u2014which Republicans don\u2019t like, because it would smack of a \u201cfederal mandate\u201d and weaken local control of elections\u2014it\u2019s likely that Georgia, just as it becomes a battleground state, will end up with election results that can\u2019t be trusted in 2020 and beyond. There was only one way to make Georgia\u2019s bad elections worse. And Brian Kemp and his cronies, by God, have found it."

    "text": "The women viewed the GABI program differently, however. At the center in St. George, they felt respected, even loved. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking of ACS,\u201d said one mother, \u201cbut then you think, \u2018No, I\u2019m going to the GABI program. It\u2019s completely different.\u2019\u201d The GABI initiative, along with several other pilot programs in New York, are part of a major effort by ACS to counteract its image as a \u201cbaby-snatching\u201d police force riddled with the same racial and economic biases that beset actual law enforcement in the United States. Together, the programs amount to an experiment: to see whether one of the largest child welfare agencies in the country can change the dynamics that have poisoned its relationship with the vulnerable families it seeks to serve and must oversee. It\u2019s a sort of idealistic gamble, deeply informed by critics who charge that child welfare agencies like ACS unfairly target the poor and the nonwhite, and treat all family crises with the hammer of child removal.\n\n\u201cIt used to be in the Bronx projects that all you had to do was shout, \u2018There\u2019s a cop in the hall,\u2019 and people would flee,\u201d said Martin Guggenheim, a law professor at NYU and a national expert on child welfare. \u201cNow you say, \u2018ACS is on the ground,\u2019 and people flee. That\u2019s one of the saddest parts: This is a helping agency, meant to support poor families, and the parents are terrified of the very agency whose charge is to support them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was so scared,\u201d one woman said, describing her terror when ACS banged on her door in the middle of the night. \u201cI thought they were going to take my kids.\u201d\n\nChanging the way a massive bureaucracy has done business for decades is no small task. Success relies not simply on new, more benevolent programs like GABI, but also on convincing ACS\u2019s community partners\u2014the private groups contracted to provide foster care and preventive services\u2014to embrace a new mission. It means convincing the holders of city and state purse strings\u2014the ACS budget is $2.7 billion for 2019\u2014to invest in experimental programs whose success won\u2019t be calculable for years, and whose failures will be splashed across the media, potentially costing government officials their jobs. Above all, it entails convincing families who, for generations, have viewed ACS as a threat, to give it another chance.\n\nIf successful, though, ACS could create a more benevolent model for child welfare that would be followed in other cities and states. ACS, which conducts more than 60,000 investigations of families each year, is one of the largest child welfare agencies in the country\u2014dwarfing many other states\u2019 agencies entirely. Its size alone guarantees that whatever happens here becomes a national model. \u201cEveryone in child welfare agrees that what\u2019s going on in New York City is relevant to the work happening elsewhere in the country,\u201d said Guggenheim. Instead of a government bureaucracy that is widely perceived as punitive and biased against the poor, ACS could transform itself into the type of agency that it wants to be: a resource families can turn to in times of trouble.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something to be said for why ACS partnered with us,\u201d Murphy said to the mothers at the St. George GABI center. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to operate out of fear, and they really want to be here to support people.\u201d The women nodded, considering the idea. Finally, one of them spoke, \u201cSo you\u2019re saying they want to change?\u201d\n\nIn January, Jennifer McClure photographed families at the GABI center in Staten Island. She then gave the parents and children art materials and invited them to draw on and decorate the images.\n\nFor more than 150 years, child welfare policies have swung back and forth between two polarized notions of how best to serve vulnerable children: Should they be removed from troubled homes, or should their families be helped? Should \u201cchild protection\u201d be the guiding principle, or \u201cfamily preservation\u201d? Where society lands on these issues has always depended on prevailing attitudes toward poverty. Reformers have long argued that taking children from poor families does nothing to address the root problem of poverty. In June, for example, Democratic Representative Gwen Moore of Wisconsin, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus who, as an 18-year-old college student, was temporarily forced to relinquish her own child to relative foster care, introduced the Family Poverty Is Not Neglect Act, which stipulates that children can\u2019t be removed from families solely on the basis of poverty-related issues. \u201cI went through the system, and was humiliated, and mistreated,\u201d Moore said in a 2017 interview. \u201cI see that there is a deliberate effort to destroy these families.\u201d Moreover, children who are placed in chronically overtaxed foster care programs experience long-lasting trauma and, as studies have shown, far higher risk of teen pregnancy, incarceration, unemployment, and homelessness, compared to children who are left in families with similar problems. Conservative critics, however, have essentially argued\u2014particularly during America\u2019s periodic drives to crack down on welfare\u2014that parents who can\u2019t support their families are, by definition, unfit.\n\nFor decades, child welfare policies have swung between two competing notions: Should kids be removed from troubled homes, or should their families be helped?\n\nFrom the mid-1800s through 1929, New York City and other Eastern cities arrived at a draconian solution, shipping as many as 250,000 children from impoverished tenement families West to the expanding U.S. frontier. Children placed on \u201corphan trains\u201d were offered for adoption at depot stops and churches along the way. (To modern eyes, many of those adoptions more closely resembled indentured servitude.) Then, in the 1910s, the pendulum swung the other way, as a movement arose to supply pensions to \u201cdeserving\u201d single mothers, particularly widows, so they could safely raise their children at home. (What minimal help that was offered, though, was restricted almost entirely to white mothers, as were the New Deal\u2019s welfare provisions two decades later.)\n\nIn the 1960s, things changed again, when the concept of child abuse was \u201crediscovered\u201d by a group of doctors that included C. Henry Kempe, a pediatrician who coined the term \u201cbattered child syndrome.\u201d Kempe\u2019s label\u2014which he described as deliberately \u201cprovocative and anger-producing\u201d\u2014helped lead to the establishment of mandatory child abuse reporting laws across the country. The idea was widely embraced, notes journalist Nina Bernstein in The Lost Children of Wilder, her account of the legal battle to reform New York City foster care, because casting child abuse as a \u201cclassless\u201d phenomenon\u2014no more endemic to the poor than the rich\u2014allowed politicians to isolate child welfare spending from the larger anti-poverty programs of the Great Society, which were by then already losing support.\n\nBut the focus on child abuse, which might seem a positive, child-oriented development, resulted in demonizing parents\u2014most often parents of color\u2014whose children suffered because of the environments they were born into. \u201cWhat was understood by some advocates as a social problem rooted in poverty and other social inequalities became widely interpreted as a symptom of individual parents\u2019 mental depravity,\u201d notes social critic Dorothy Roberts in her book Shattered Bonds: The Color of Child Welfare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been a classless problem, and it certainly is not today,\u201d said Gottlieb. \u201cIf legislators say, \u2018We\u2019re going to pour these billions into supporting poor families,\u2019 it won\u2019t go anywhere. If we say, \u2018We\u2019re going to protect children from abusive parents\u2019\u2014if we label a demon\u2014then the money can follow that.\u201d In the child welfare system today, she said, \u201ceverything we do for families is set up around the idea that \u2018We have to protect our children from you.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the 1970s, the class-action lawsuit Wilder v. Bernstein took aim at racial discrimination within the private agencies that handled New York City\u2019s foster care with taxpayer support, but which systematically excluded black children. Black children at the time were relegated to harsh, decrepit juvenile reformatories, in which, in some cases, more than 80 percent of the kids hadn\u2019t committed crimes but were simply would-be foster children. The racial disparity was so stark, Nina Bernstein notes, that the superintendent of one facility called it \u201ca plantation.\u201d By the time Wilder was settled in 1986, almost 15 years after it began, the city\u2019s foster care system was starting to explode amid the aids and crack epidemics. By the early 1990s, there were nearly 50,000 children in the system\u2014almost all of whom were black.\n\nPolitics at the national level only made matters worse, as the political establishment turned against welfare and began to argue explicitly that parents who needed support to raise their children had no business keeping them. In 1994, Newt Gingrich put it most bluntly: \u201cWe\u2019ll help you with foster care, we\u2019ll help you with orphanages, we\u2019ll help you with adoption\u201d\u2014but not, as Bernstein noted, with money for family preservation, a position that was echoed in the Contract With America that Gingrich proposed later that year. By 1997, when Congress passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act, establishing a tight timetable for terminating parental rights and offering foster children for adoption, the campaign against keeping families together had become so forceful that one magazine headline read, \u201cfamily preservation\u2014it can kill.\u201d\n\nThe force of the pendulum swing between child protection and family preservation is often driven by high-profile tragedies. In New York in 1995, Elisa Izquierdo, a six-year-old girl from Brooklyn, was brutally beaten to death by her mother after repeated reports of abuse from neighbors and Izquierdo\u2019s school went unheeded by the city\u2019s Child Welfare Administration and other city and state agencies. The case became a national scandal. Time magazine published a haunting photo of the girl on its cover, under the title, \u201ca shameful death: let down by the system, murdered by her mom, a little girl symbolizes america\u2019s failure to protect its children.\u201d The Child Welfare Administration was abolished, and ACS was created in its stead.\n\nIzquierdo\u2019s death sparked what has become a familiar pattern of overcorrection, common in the aftermath of such tragedies, in which child welfare officials ramp up family separations, in an effort to avoid another catastrophic \u201cmiss.\u201d Through the mid-\u201990s, notes a recent report by the Center for New York City Affairs, a policy research institute at the New School, the ACS caseworkers\u2019 union even counseled its members with the grim slogan, \u201cWhen in doubt, pull \u2019em out.\u201d And they did: In the three years following Izquierdo\u2019s death, the number of children taken into ACS custody increased by 50 percent.\n\nFamily preservation advocates like the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform call this a \u201cfoster care panic.\u201d It is hardly unique to New York. In the two years following the 1993 murder of a toddler in Illinois, the state\u2019s foster care system grew by 44 percent, rendering Illinois children more likely to end up in state custody than anywhere else in the United States.\n\nBut the need to intervene more is the wrong lesson to take from tragedy. \u201cChildren fall through the cracks not because child welfare agencies are devoting too much to family preservation,\u201d Dorothy Roberts writes, but \u201cbecause agencies are devoting too much to child removal.\u201d When there are too many children in foster care, she argues, there are neither enough foster homes to care for them, nor enough caseworkers with adequate time to identify those children who are truly at risk. Indeed, NCCPR notes, three years after the foster care panic began in Illinois, child deaths in the state had increased by 17 percent. Moreover, the focus on child protection creates perverse incentives for caseworkers and welfare agencies. \u201cThere has never been a preventive services worker in the history of child welfare who has ever been penalized for not helping a family enough,\u201d said Gottlieb. \u201cBut they are penalized all the time for not doing enough to protect the kid.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, a similar panic flared again, following the deaths in New York of two children whom ACS had left in their homes. That September, a six-year-old boy from Harlem named Zymere Perkins was allegedly beaten to death by his mother\u2019s boyfriend just weeks after an ACS caseworker closed his case. Two months later, three-year-old Jaden Jordan of Gravesend, Brooklyn, died. ACS had received an anonymous report that the boy was being kept in a dog crate, but for two days, caseworkers couldn\u2019t locate him, because they had been given the wrong address, and staff didn\u2019t know how to find the correct one in their system. Like Perkins, Jordan was allegedly beaten to death by his mother\u2019s boyfriend.\n\nThe ensuing public outcry was tremendous. \u201cHow ACS Failed Him,\u201d read the headline of a New York Post article detailing the abuse Perkins suffered. The city\u2019s other tabloid, the Daily News, lambasted Perkins\u2019s caseworker with a cover story that declared, \u201cshe let him die to get promoted.\u201d Then\u2013ACS Commissioner Gladys Carri\u00f3n, a reformer who had focused on preventive services intended to keep children out of foster care, resigned under pressure.\n\nSince then, ACS has been eager to repair its image. In June, it launched a public relations campaign featuring videos and subway ads with children and parents who\u2019d been involved with the system declaring, \u201cACS fought for my family.\u201d In June, the agency unveiled a \u201cCPS appreciation week,\u201d to honor New York City\u2019s child protective specialists, its \u201cfirst responders\u201d for children. And its new commissioner, David Hansell, who succeeded Carri\u00f3n in February 2017, has been courting the media in an effort to improve public perception of the agency.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of terrible tragedies,\u201d Hansell told me, \u201cand the dynamic we\u2019ve seen over and over again\u2014not just in New York City but across the country\u2014is that a terrible tragedy happens, it gets a lot of attention in the public, there are investigations, and so on. It leads the child welfare agency to be reactive and defensive and to be more draconian.\u201d He vowed to address this cycle by focusing on the root causes that underlie tragedies like child deaths, rather than seeking individuals or communities to blame.\n\nYet from 2016 to 2017, the number of children placed in foster care in the city increased 13 percent. Hansell attributed the increase not to caseworker reactiveness but to a rise in public reporting\u2014up 7 percent since 2016. However, in the year and a half following Perkins\u2019s death, ACS has also presided over a 54 percent increase in the number of cases it brought to family court, and a roughly 30 percent increase in emergency removals\u2014when ACS takes a child from parents before even seeing a judge. As a result, warned a July report from the Center for New York City Affairs, ACS staff caseloads have increased, families have been put on months-long waiting lists to receive preventive services, and family courts have been so swamped with cases that attorneys say it\u2019s led to \u201ca new level of dysfunction,\u201d with delays and deferrals \u201cthat impact every family in the system.\u201d\n\nI got a sense of this when I visited the Bronx Family Court, an imposing brutalist structure not far from Yankee Stadium. In June, in a windowless waiting room on the seventh floor, I watched a distraught young mother\u2014African American, like almost everyone else there\u2014approach the court clerk and two white lawyers who were complaining about the bad courthouse Wi-Fi and their children\u2019s college grades.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, what\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked. Her court- appointed attorney had left New York without anyone telling her, and her new lawyer hadn\u2019t shown up. \u201cI come every time [ACS] sets court appointments, and they never show,\u201d she said. The clerk apologized, then looked to one of the attorneys, who was there representing ACS: Maybe he should talk to the agency about why the mother\u2019s caseworker hadn\u2019t been in touch. The mother walked back to a wooden bench, where a young boy and an adult man waited silently. \u201cThis happens every day,\u201d she said, angry to the point of tears.\n\nInside one of the courtrooms, another African American woman, middle-aged, with braids pulled into a side bun, sat at the center of a U-shaped table, listening as her public defender explained that she\u2019d been accepted to an in-patient substance abuse program that allows parents to keep their children with them. A court-appointed guardian, there to represent the woman\u2019s young daughter, objected, saying it was too soon to place the child back in the mother\u2019s custody, and that the city should wait to see if she could stay sober. An ACS attorney concurred, arguing that the mother should only be allowed to see her daughter before entering rehab if she passed a drug test that day. The judge agreed to both requests, then asked the lawyers about their vacation plans before setting a date to reconvene in a month. The mother, whom no one had addressed directly, started to cry.\n\n"

    "text": "Ajit Pai thinks net neutrality held us all back. It stifled innovation, he said. It deprived consumers of choices, starved rural communities of broadband, and even threatened the survival of the internet itself. Pai, who lobbied for Verizon before Barack Obama appointed him to the Federal Communications Commission, has prioritized the repeal of Obama-era net neutrality rules since becoming its chairman under President Donald Trump. Considering Pai\u2019s background in the telecommunications industry, which has long wanted more control over how it delivers internet content, it makes sense that he has targeted the rules classifying internet service providers as Title II carriers, which subjected them to stricter regulation and prohibited providers from creating \u201cfast lanes\u201d that users could access for a fee. On Thursday afternoon, the FCC voted 3-2 to repeal the rules, and Pai killed his dragon.\n\n\u201cYou can still drive memes right into the ground,\u201d he joked in a Daily Caller video released ahead of the FCC vote. Pai\u2019s jocularity, however, hides a more sinister truth: His war on net neutrality is an extension of the Trump administration\u2019s war against the working class. His justifications are the same justifications put forward in any defense of deregulation, whether it\u2019s in the financial industry or the oil and gas sector. The result is the same: More profits for companies, with dubious benefits for consumers. Corporations exist to make money, and making the internet as cheap and accessible as possible is not in their financial interests. They certainly are not in the business of making sure the people with the least disposable income, or who live the farthest away, can get internet access.\n\nIn conversations with The New Republic, net neutrality advocates expressed deep concern about the FCC\u2019s vote. \u201cYou can\u2019t even get a job at Walmart without having reliable internet access, let alone do a complicated homework assignment or find a great health care plan,\u201d said Hannah Sassaman, policy director for the Media Mobilizing Project. \u201cAll of the basic pieces of dignity that most of us who have reliable and affordable internet take for granted go completely out the window without net neutrality.\u201d\n\nThe impact on rural communities could be particularly severe. The FCC itself found in 2016 that 39 percent of rural Americans lack access to internet speeds of at least 25 Mbps. That figure increases to 41 percent for Americans living in tribal territory and it\u2019s higher still\u201468 percent\u2014for anyone living in rural tribal territory. \u201cWithout net neutrality rural residents will experience another form of systemic oppression and discrimination, I just know it,\u201d said Dr. Jacquelyn Bragg, coordinator of the Community Economic Development Network of East Tennessee. \u201cIt is critically essential to economic development.\u201d"

    "text": "If sanctions fail to cause regime change, Step Two is to coerce or bribe military officers to overthrow the regime. That failed in Iraq and has thus far failed in Venezuela. Last fall, Trump\u2019s administration \u201cheld secret meetings with rebellious military officers from Venezuela to discuss their plans to overthrow President Maduro,\u201d the New York Times reported.\n\nSimultaneously, the administration began openly calling for Maduro\u2019s ouster. Last November, Bolton spoke at Freedom Tower, a building where anti-Castro Cubans were welcomed in 1960 after Castro\u2019s revolution toppled dictator Fulgencio Batista. \u201cThe troika of tyranny in this hemisphere\u2014Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua\u2014has finally met its match,\u201d he declared. He referred to the leaders of that trio of countries as \u201cclowns\u201d who were \u201cakin to Larry, Curly and Moe\u201d of the Three Stooges, and demanded they step aside or the U.S. would remove them from power.\n\nWe are now at about the stage in Venezuela where, in the Iraq case, the Bush administration invaded. Just weeks ago, the Trump administration announced it would recall all of its diplomats from Caracas and the Maduro government, in retaliation, shut down its Washington embassy and brought its personnel home. Trump has recognized as president the leader of the National Assembly, Juan Guaid\u00f3, a former electronics peddler with largely foreign support and now busy rattling sabers and promising that Maduro\u2019s days are numbered.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what exactly comes next. Will the U.S. invade? As insane as that sounds, we are dealing with Trump. What about a U.S.-prompted military coup? Or will the CIA once again try to kill Maduro, as it tried to kill Saddam Hussein, Fidel Castro, and a host of other \u201cenemies\u201d?\n\nProphecy is always dangerous. But here\u2019s why I would bet on Maduro.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that brutal U.S. economic sanctions, in addition to Maduro\u2019s own corrupt and repressive policies, have created a lot of misery and discontent. People are tired and believe, understandably, that the United States will continue to starve the country\u2014and them\u2014until Maduro is gone.\n\nLast week, brought to Caracas by the International Peoples\u2019 Assembly, an anti-interventionist Latin American group holding a conference, I wandered away from the official events to walk through the impoverished barrios. \u201cI want a coup,\u201d said one young woman I spoke to, who works in the hospitality industry. \u201cI am fed up.\u201d She was the only person I met who openly supported a coup, and said so with no apparent fear of political consequences. (I walked around Caracas, day and night, openly stating my politics\u2014no one, from the government nor the opposition, harassed me or was angered by me sharing my opinions.)\n\nBut while Maduro could hardly be called well-liked, Guaid\u00f3 and the U.S.-dominated opposition are widely reviled and rejected. Very few Venezuelans want to go back to 1989, when the army killed so many protestors, or to 1998, the year before Chavez was elected. Those who do are often members of the wealthy old order. Fittingly, one of the main opposition points is George Washington Plaza, a rich neighborhood sandwiched between the barrios of El Paraiso and La Vega.\n\nAnd while American politicians favoring intervention often point to U.S. media reports of widespread shortages and even starvation, what I saw when walking through the city was a different story.\n\nI met Viviana at a union meeting in El Paraiso, and we walked to her home about two kilometers away afterward. William, who was also at the union meeting, joined us. During the walk, I saw plenty of food. It may be expensive, but poor people can buy it\u2014coffee, sugar, chicken, bread, a dazzling assortment of fruit, among other things\u2014from street vendors and at street markets.\n\nCertain things are indeed prohibitively costly: As we walked to Viviana\u2019s house, I looked for someone on the street smoking a cigarette so I could bum a light. To my surprise, I couldn\u2019t find anyone for 20 minutes. \u201cCigarettes are too expensive,\u201d Viviana explained. \u201cNo one can afford to smoke anymore.\n\nViviana and William, however, then went on to feed me a delicious dinner of blood sausage, Pasta Bolognese and rice and chicken liver\u2014all items Viviana had on hand in her house in the low-income barrio of La Vega. At the entrance to the neighborhood, people were lined up waiting for buses and moto taxis. Even more than most barrios I visited, La Vega is overwhelmingly Chavista, featuring wall murals of former president Chavez, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, El Libertador, Che Guevara, and other revolutionary Latin American leaders.\n\nI visited a number of other barrios and didn\u2019t have time to stop for a meal, although I was invited. In San August\u00edn\u2014central Caracas\u2014I met a woman, who preferred to be anonymous, who showed me her home high up the mountainside. The view from her window included a luxury apartment building. Most of the units were sitting empty, she told me, because the owners had fled to Miami, Orlando, Madrid, Lisbon, and elsewhere abroad.\n\nI also met Iris, Navidad, and Pedro, who I became quite friendly with. We drank beer and smoked cigarettes, and they allowed me to take their photographs. We didn\u2019t discuss politics much, but it was apparent they didn\u2019t like Guaid\u00f3 or the opposition. They also clearly were not going hungry and looked well fed and happy.\n\nAnother reason I believe a coup won\u2019t work is because the U.S. has not been able to put together a bogus coalition to mount an invasion, as it did in Iraq in 2003. Both the Brazilian and Colombian governments have publicly declared they will not participate in an armed foray into Venezuela.\n\nNor have the Trump administration\u2019s overtures to the Venezuelan military been effective. Thus far, the inner circle around the president appears to be holding tight. And why would they defect to the Yankees? It\u2019s a huge risk, given that if the coup fails you\u2019re likely to be arrested: A house in Miami or an offshore Delaware bank account won\u2019t do you a lot of good in a prison cell.\n\nMaduro keeps a close eye on the military. Or more specifically, Diosdado Cabello keeps a close eye on the military, and everything else in Venezuela. Cabello is the most powerful person in Venezuela and the power behind Maduro\u2019s throne. A military official, he and Chavez were close at least since the failed 1992 coup attempt against CAP. I was told by multiple sources that Chavez picked the hapless Maduro to be vice president only because he was wary of having the cagey, brilliant Cabello as second-in-command.\n\nThe Trump administration can keep trying to induce or threaten Venezuelan military officers to depose Maduro, but good luck. Such traitors\u2014and let\u2019s face it, it is treason in any country to take up arms against your own government in exchange for cash and/or promises of career advancement from a foreign power\u2014would almost surely be caught and dealt with harshly.\n\nThat leaves a U.S. invasion as the only practical option to get rid of Maduro. Sure, Bolton, Abrams, Rubio, and other right-wing politicians\u2014some like Rubio who receive lavish campaign contributions from pro-coup interests\u2014are all for war, but they\u2019re not going to die fighting in the streets of Caracas. Well-placed sources have told me that a majority of senior Pentagon and intelligence officials oppose a U.S. invasion, recognizing that it would be folly.\n\nCuriously, American oil companies with interests in Venezuela, such as ExxonMobil and Chevron, have not said much publicly about Trump\u2019s attempt to overthrow Maduro. Hopefully that\u2019s because they know\u2014as the president should\u2014that war is bad for business. The oil companies do have a fortune at stake in Venezuela, however, and could ultimately decide they\u2019ll make more with Maduro out of the way.\n\nIf history is any guide, it will take an outside power\u2014the United States\u2014to provoke a war. That\u2019s the clear aim of Rubio, but he\u2019s becoming increasingly erratic and desperate as he flails around trying to trigger a conflagration, even tweeting a bloody image of former Libya ruler Muammar Gaddafi as he demands Maduro to step down.\n\nMaduro may be corrupt, authoritarian, bombastic, and unstable\u2014qualities he shares with the American president fixated on deposing him. He may even have found ways to inflate his numbers in the 2018 election. But for the time being, he remains his country\u2019s sitting president. Trump and his interventionist advisers are unlikely to change that\u2014and they\u2019d probably do better not to try.\n\nThis article has been updated to clarify Diosdado Cabello\u2019s position in the government in 2002 and ExxonMobil\u2019s current relationship with Venezuela."

    "text": "At one point last year, Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Beth Jones went so far as to organize a mini-revolt against Bolton, penning a memo to Colin Powell, co-signed by the assistant secretaries from every regional bureau, which complained that Bolton\u2019s campaign for bilateral agreements exempting Americans from prosecution by the ICC had been a failure and should be abandoned. In response to the memo, Powell called a meeting between Bolton and the assistant secretaries. Both sides argued their case, and Powell ended up granting Bolton permission to proceed. In the months since Jones tried to abort Bolton\u2019s campaign, he has signed agreements with 81 countries.\n\n\u201cBolton\u2019s best kept as far as possible from foreign officials,\u201d says Greg Thielmann, formerly assigned as an intelligence liaison to Bolton (and no fan of his), \u201cbut I\u2019ll give the devil his due; he\u2019s been very effective.\u201d Partly, this success derives from the fact that Bolton takes his cues exclusively from the White House. In his book The Case for Bureaucracy, Charles Goodsell writes, \u201cThe agency positions in which bureaucrats \u2018sit\u2019 have much to do with where they \u2018stand.\u2019\u201d Nothing could be less true of Bolton, who follows the \u201cJames Baker model\u201d of bureaucratic management\u2014like the former secretary of state, whose ties to Bolton date back 25 years, he views himself as the White House emissary at Foggy Bottom rather than the other way around. \u201cJohn has had the luxury of Powell delegating red-meat issues and deferring to him on subjects where [Bolton] is closely aligned with the White House, which is quite frequently,\u201d says Gary Schmitt, executive director of the Project for the New American Century. State Department officials often describe Bolton as President Bush\u2019s \u201calter ego,\u201d but Bush\u2019s actual ego may be closer to the truth, since Bolton comes closer than anyone at Foggy Bottom to being an authentic expression of White House statecraft. As one mystified career State Department employee puts it, \u201cAt first we thought that Powell and Armitage would control Bolton. We kept waiting, and now Bolton seems to be controlling them.\u201d\n\nEqually important, while his neoconservative counterparts struggle to transform an ambitious vision into reality, Bolton, when not tearing down in the name of America First, wages a narrowly focused, pragmatic campaign to dot i\u2019s and cross t\u2019s. \u201cJohn has a very deep anchor, but let\u2019s just say he also has a very long line,\u201d says one of Bolton\u2019s colleagues, by way of explaining how Bolton\u2019s realism extends to operating within the very institutions\u2014and often on behalf of official policies\u2014that he plainly despises. Hence, Bolton, who once said that, if U.N. headquarters in New York \u201clost ten stories, it wouldn\u2019t make a bit of difference,\u201d has spent the past three years working its corridors\u2014to indisputable effect. Hence, too, Bolton the ideologue invokes Edmund Burke\u2019s admonition that the way to discover \u201cwhat is false theory is by comparing it to practice,\u201d and, according to Keith Payne, until recently a deputy assistant secretary of defense in the Bush Pentagon, \u201cHe sees the world as it is, without any illusions.\u201d This is particularly true of Bolton\u2019s approach to nonproliferation issues, which he approaches in decidedly technocratic fashion. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to operate in a dream world,\u201d he tells me, \u201cbut the goal is to have an impact and a deterrent effect.\u201d\n\nThe contrast here is less one of ends than means. When it comes to North Korea, for instance, Pentagon officials have floated solutions ranging from the hopeful (Kim Jong II\u2019s regime collapsing under its own totalitarian weight) and the far-fetched (encouraging a military coup) to the apocalyptic (plans for a military strike against the North). Bolton, by contrast, has focused his energies on a less ambitious project that responds to the world simply as it is. That project, the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), aims to interdict weapons-related cargo bound to and from rogue states. PSI, in which Bolton has enlisted 15 nations, has resulted in the boarding of several North Korean vessels over the past year. But it netted its biggest haul in October, a shipload of uranium-enrichment centrifuge parts destined for Libya. \u201cThe PSI seizure of uranium centrifuge equipment was a major factor in Libya\u2019s decision to give up on WMD [weapons of mass destruction],\u201d Bolton claims. At the time, American and British diplomats had been negotiating with Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi about his WMD programs for months, \u201cbut the [Libyans] only came clean after they got caught,\u201d says one intelligence official. Even Bolton skeptics credit the feat. \u201cBy staking out a more muscular approach to proliferation threats and raising doubts about the effectiveness of more traditional approaches,\u201d says Robert Einhorn, assistant secretary of state for nonproliferation during the Clinton administration, \u201cthe Bush administration has, in effect, challenged the Europeans to show that their preferred methods can work.\u201d Indeed, while Bolton claims not to \u201cdo carrots,\u201d in both the Libyan and North Korean cases his \u201cmuscular approach,\u201d far from prompting a hardening of their positions, helped achieve the opposite result: Pyongyang\u2019s agreement to the long-held U.S. demand that it negotiate with America and her allies across the same table and Tripoli\u2019s decision to abandon its WMD programs.\n\nIn his diplomatic efforts at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Bolton the realist also emerges clearly. Here, too, Pentagon officials have calculated that the surest way to put an end to Teheran\u2019s WMD arsenal is to put an end to the regime that presides over it, by rearming Iraq-based Iranian opposition groups or pinning their hopes on the possibility that, as neoconservative writer Michael Ledeen puts it, \u201cthe United States could provide the decisive support that would guarantee success of [a] democratic revolution.\u201d Yet a democratization policy, however politically and morally necessary, is not a counterproliferation policy\u2014not least because Iran\u2019s democrats profess to be as eager to acquire nuclear weapons as its theocrats.\n\nBolton, by contrast, simply focuses on the weapons themselves. Last September, he fiercely lobbied the IAEA board on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which responded by giving Teheran until October 31, 2003, to explain itself. Sensing trouble ahead, Britain, France, and Germany then persuaded Iran to sign an additional protocol, allowing for surprise inspections. Challenged by Bolton to take a firmer stand, the IAEA board followed up in November with a resolution that threatened to declare Teheran in violation of the nonproliferation treaty \u201cshould any further serious Iranian failures come to light.\u201d Last month, one clearly did, when IAEA inspectors stumbled across designs for a sophisticated centrifuge. To provide an adequate response to the threat, however, Bolton clearly trusts neither IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei nor the United Nations as a whole. Hence, even while he presses the IAEA to act, he has pressured Russia not to supply fuel to Iran\u2019s reactors. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no question that Bolton\u2019s strategy of pressuring the IAEA led its members to finally get serious about Iran\u2019s weapons programs,\u201d says Ray Takeyh, an Iran specialist at National Defense University.\n\nThere is, to be sure, something missing here. Despite its thoroughly American pedigree, Bolton\u2019s worldview lacks any trace of the American creed\u2014liberalism. Thus, the neoconservative reading of the war in Iraq does not square with Bolton\u2019s. The former argued that America\u2019s duty would be discharged neither when Saddam Hussein was toppled nor even when Iraq subsequently had a decent government, but only when it became a pivot for democratizing the region. Bolton, by contrast, was arguing months before the war that the United States should oust Saddam and, according to one member of his team, \u201cget the hell out immediately.\u201d Bolton\u2019s pessimistic reading of the international scene kept him from buying into the neocons\u2019 fundamentally liberal assumptions about postwar Iraq and, significantly, distanced him from the controversies that flowed from them.\n\nIt has also kept him from grasping the broader significance of the enterprise. \u201cJohn\u2019s far more skeptical than neocons about nation-building and democratization,\u201d says Schmitt. That understates the distinction, for Bolton has explicitly repudiated both ideas. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to build a platonic international order,\u201d Bolton told me. \u201cWe\u2019re responding to specific threats with a national-interest approach.\u201d\n\nHis triumph, then, amounts to a triumph of realism, of low expectations. It also says something about the limits of idealism\u2014about neoconservatism, some of whose adherents have gone from being, in Irving Kristol\u2019s famous phrase, \u201cliberals mugged by reality\u201d to purists who no longer attempt to fashion a realistic political ideal; and about liberalism, or at least that brand of liberalism that believes U.S. power should be used only in concert with the international community. Finally, Bolton\u2019s success represents a failure of the international community itself, which too often stands aside while the United States chases its selfish and narrowly conceived interests but which cries \u201cimperialism\u201d when it does the reverse.\n\nHence, we\u2019re left with Bolton himself, holding up one leg of America\u2019s grand strategy, while the rest collapses around him. It\u2019s not enough. But, as Jack Nicholson\u2019s Colonel Jessep\u2014sounding a lot like John Bolton\u2014put it, \u201cWe live in a world that has walls,\u201d and \u201cdeep down, in places you don\u2019t talk about at parties, you want me on that wall.\u201d If nowhere else, Bolton belongs on the wall."

On Sunday, The Washington Post reported that his administration is assembling a panel of fringe, industry-funded scientists who \u201crepresent the Trump administration\u2019s most forceful effort to date to challenge the scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are helping drive global warming and that the world could face dire consequences unless countries curb their carbon output over the next few decades.\u201d\n\nAs Trump denies, though, Democrats delay. On Friday, in an encounter caught on video, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein told a group of teenage and preteen climate activists that she won\u2019t support the Green New Deal, an ambitious plan to fight climate change introduced by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey earlier this month. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to pay for it,\u201d she said, referring to the plan\u2019s pledge to decarbonize the U.S. economy by the year 2030.\n\n\n\nThe children pleaded with Feinstein to be \u201cbrave\u201d and to think about their future. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who are going to be impacted,\u201d one girl pleaded.

    "text": "In 1997, Keith Flint was very confused. After a long youth dancing in English rural barns (literally\u2014his local club in Essex was called The Barn), the band he sang for was breaking America. With its third album, The Fat of the Land, led by the massive singles \u201cFirestarter\u201d and \u201cBreathe,\u201d The Prodigy became the first of the 1990s British dance acts to cross the Atlantic. In a Spin magazine cover story, Flint, who died this week at the age of 49, described his bafflement at the way British rave culture was being translated for Americans. People seemed to \u201cthink it\u2019s about the internet, the future, technology, play stations\u2014and it isn\u2019t!\u201d he said.\n\nThe story of how The Prodigy came to symbolize a kind of techno-dystopian darkness says as much about the late 1990s as the band itself. The Prodigy had been famous in Britain since 1991, when their debut song \u201cCharly\u201d flooded dance floors across the nation. The song sampled an informational broadcast instructing listeners to \u201calways tell your mummy before you go off somewhere\u201d over a neat little breakbeat and some noises like lasers gone haywire, in between meows from a cartoon cat. Back then, The Prodigy was sometimes derided as \u201ckiddie-techno,\u201d because of their juvenile samples and because the teens loved them. Britain\u2019s rave scene was an all-ages affair, with day-glo clothes everywhere, smiley faces, and pacifiers for the gurners.\n\nFlint started out as the band\u2019s dancer, \u00e0 la Bez from the Happy Mondays, but ended up as frontman. With the twin spears of his hairdo thrust forward, his wide boy vocals grated over Liam Howlett\u2019s clean production, a bloody smear against glass. In videos he bared his teeth and banged his head, eyes rolling. He really was a sight.\n\nFlint had met Howlett at a rave in 1989. Flint asked him for a mixtape, which he returned along with a few of his own songs. The pair were also friends with Leeroy Thornhill, a dancer like Flint, adept at a beautifully old-school shuffle. They added MC Maxim and a singer named Sharky, and The Prodigy was born. (Members would leave and join as the years wore on.) The band got popular so quickly that Howlett had to prove he hadn\u2019t sold out by anonymously releasing two stonking records, the delicious \u201cEarthbound 1\u201d and \u201cEarthbound 2.\u201d DJs sniffed when they found out that Howlett of \u201cCharly\u201d fame had cut the records, but they safeguarded his reputation."

    "text": "Dragan Umi\u010devi\u0107, a volunteer who was prosecuted in Croatia this past year for allegedly helping a family illegally cross into the country from Serbia, saw this shift happen in real time. Umi\u010devi\u0107 lives near the Serbian border; in 2015, thousands of asylum seekers began to move through the area, tracing a path north that became known as the \u201cBalkan Route.\u201d In response, Umi\u010devi\u0107 and his friends began bringing food and blankets.\n\nTrafficking charges against aid workers have become so commonplace that they are now used as threats.\n\nFor a brief moment, the EU responded to the situation as a humanitarian crisis. \u201cThe political situation was to help people,\u201d Umi\u010devi\u0107 told me. \u201cNow it\u2019s gone in the direction of these people aren\u2019t welcome anymore.\u201d In March 2016, Umi\u010devi\u0107 watched as tens of thousands of asylum seekers on the Balkan Route were stopped in their tracks overnight.\n\nSince then, criminal prosecution of humanitarian aid workers has proliferated. \u201cThe EU and its institutions, particularly the European Commission and Frontex, and the member states, have presented their actions as a battle against the \u2018traffickers\u2019 who profit from the refugees\u2019 plight,\u201d Frances Webber, the vice chair of the Institute of Race Relations and a former barrister who\u2019s done extensive work on solidarity criminalization, told me over email. The irony, she pointed out, is that closed and militarized borders have actually created a greater demand for traffickers, opening vulnerable asylum seekers up to financial and sexual exploitation. And because of the 2002 facilitation directive, people associated with border crossers for humanitarian reasons become tarred with the same brush as the traffickers.\n\nOne of the first high-profile cases of such prosecution occurred on Lesvos in January 2016, when five foreign volunteers were charged with human trafficking after responding to a routine distress call at sea. As with Mardini and Binder, the defendants had cooperated regularly with the Greek authorities on search-and-rescue missions. Since then, everyone from 24 crew members of the rescue boat Aquarius to the editor-in-chief of the Belgian Marie Claire has been charged with human trafficking, prosecuted for actions ranging from rescuing people at sea to briefly housing them and purchasing them cellphones.\n\nMigrant families, helped by volunteers, on the coast of Lesvos in 2015. Bulent Kilic/AFP/Getty Images\n\nNational laws on trafficking vary widely from member state to member state and are patchily and even disingenuously enforced, as Webber wrote in a 2017 briefing on the subject. Though the case against Umi\u010devi\u0107, for example, fell apart in court\u2014GPS data showed that the family he stood accused of spiriting across the border was already in Croatia by the time they made contact with him\u2014he was still convicted of \u201cunconscious negligence\u201d and tagged with an 8000 euro fine.\n\nIf Umi\u010devi\u0107 had been convicted of helping the migrants cross, he would have faced far harsher consequences: Croatian law makes no distinction between humanitarian assistance and illegal aid. Only eight member states include exceptions for humanitarian intervention (or specific types of humanitarian intervention: providing food, but not transport, for example) in their national anti-trafficking laws. But that doesn\u2019t mean these exemptions are honored in practice. In Greece, a law governing facilitation of illegal entry exempts sea rescue\u2014but Greek authorities claimed the volunteers in the 2016 Lesvos case were found in international waters, implying that they had been running refugees between Turkey and Greece. In Mardini and Binder\u2019s case, the police\u2019s theory of a vast smuggling conspiracy likewise aimed to preclude a defense of humanitarian rescue.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know for sure whether the overzealous prosecution of aid workers is merely a byproduct of closed borders or a coherent strategy of deterrence\u2014for one thing, prosecutors would never admit to an EU-wide plot to deliberately target pro-refugee civilians. What seems fairly undeniable is that EU member states have taken full advantage of the 2002 directive\u2019s \u201chigh degree of legislative ambiguity,\u201d as a 2016 European Parliament study put it. Trafficking charges against aid workers have become so commonplace that they are now used as threats: In February, the unabashedly xenophobic Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini tried to intimidate the British crew of rescue ship Sea-Watch 3 with the possibility of an investigation into human trafficking charges for their actions in rescuing 47 migrants in the Mediterranean.\n\nHarassment of humanitarians also sometimes seems to exceed what a state might find practical for another crime. Human rights activist Helena Maleno Garz\u00f3n has been observing migrant and border militarization issues in Spain\u2019s Moroccan enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta for years. The government, she told me, regards people like her as \u201cunwelcome witnesses\u201d to police abuse and security contracts with Spanish companies with questionable human rights records.\n\nMaleno has spent much of her career trying to draw attention to the persecution that human rights defenders around the world face. In 2012, she discovered she herself was under investigation by the Spanish government. But, unable to find enough incriminating evidence on Maleno to prosecute her in Spanish courts, the police eventually handed over their intelligence to Moroccan authorities, according to Maleno and her lawyers. In early 2018, she was hauled into court in Tangier, accused of people smuggling for her work receiving distress calls from migrants at sea and passing them on to maritime rescue operations. A year later, she\u2019s still waiting for the judge\u2019s decision.\n\nStill, more often than not, courts around the EU seem to recognize the instinctive distinction between trafficking and humanitarian aid, despite prosecutors\u2019 efforts. In May this past year, the 2016 Lesvos smuggling case was finally resolved when the defendants were cleared of all charges in Greek court. And in December, the conviction of C\u00e9dric Herrou was overturned by France\u2019s highest court. The decision to send Herrou\u2019s case back to the Lyon court of appeals for reconsideration was based on by a ruling several months earlier that those who facilitate illegal entry into the country without being compensated for it should be immune from the usual penalties, under the French principle of fraternit\u00e9.\n\nBut the fact that these cases aren\u2019t holding up in court hasn\u2019t deterred authorities from continuing to mount them, or attempting to see them through to the bitter end. Webber finds it \u201castonishing\u201d that charges were brought against Mardini, Karakitsos, and Binder in the first place, given the five Lesvos defendants\u2019 acquittal. Though that case has now all but collapsed, a trial will most likely still take place\u2014\u201cit would be unprecedented\u201d to drop it entirely, Binder told me. Maleno\u2019s investigation, which she has described as a \u201csword of Damocles\u201d hanging over her head, remains open, and Umi\u010devi\u0107 is currently mired in an appeals process.\n\nThese prosecutions generally don\u2019t lock people up for the rest of their lives, and they don\u2019t seem to affect the desire of migrants to seek asylum in Europe. But they do act as a pretty effective deterrent when it comes to aid work. Binder\u2019s lawyer recently told press that \u201chundreds of volunteers have been discouraged, and on Lesvos many have left.\u201d Since ERCI was forced to suspend its operations, there are no more formal search-and-rescue organizations active on Lesvos\u2019s southern shore. The forced confinement to port of a number of rescue ships means that untold numbers of people have drowned in the Mediterranean.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re confronted with this type of criminalization, it has a really big impact on your life,\u201d Maleno told me. \u201cYou need to take security precautions\u2014I have to evaluate the risk to my family, to my children. It also has an impact on work. I can\u2019t do my investigatory work with the freedom I had before.\u201d\n\nThis article originally misstated the number of people prosecuted in 2018 for assisting border crossers as \u201cat least 99,\u201d rather than 89. We regret the error."

    "text": "\u201cIn every high school and every college in Latin America you learn about these interventions,\u201d said Alan McPherson, a Temple University history professor who focuses on U.S. relations with Latin America. \u201cThey are fresh in the mind of the public whenever there\u2019s any intervention of any kind or whenever a politician wants to sort of exploit this public memory.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s another reason many remember prior interventions so clearly: the effects persist to this day. The 2002 coup attempt against then Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, later found to have been sanctioned by the Bush administration, is still used by Maduro in the present to discredit his opposition, accusing the Trump administration of both assassination and coup attempts. \u201cDonald Trump gave the order to kill me,\u201d Maduro said in January, \u201ctold the Colombian government, the Colombian mafia to kill me. If something happens to me, Donald Trump and Colombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque will be responsible.\u201d\n\nThat troubled legacy of American intervention is most striking in Central America: Around 200,000 people were killed and another 45,000 forcibly disappeared during Guatemala\u2019s armed conflict, with more than 90 percent of the genocide estimated to have been committed by the United States-backed military. In El Salvador\u2019s \u201cdirty war\u201d in the 1980s, the UN now believes 85 percent of atrocities were perpetrated by U.S.-supported government forces. In both of these countries, as well as in Honduras, U.S. actions have markedly contributed to the instability migrants are now fleeing when they head to the United States border.\n\n\u201cThe roots of what\u2019s going on now in most countries go back to what happened at the end of the Cold War,\u201d said Cecilia Menj\u00edvar, a UCLA researcher studying Central America and migration.\n\nAnd the interventions were rarely clean and precise, said Menj\u00edvar. Rather, they had a ripple effect, each coup and cascade of violence blending into the next, with instability frequently spilling over into other countries.\n\nThat spillover potential worries Favia Noricta, a 50-year-old Colombian living on the border, a region that\u2019s already been eclipsed by the more than three million people leaving their country, nearly half landing in Colombia.\n\n\u201cWe want the exit of Maduro. Only that,\u201d he said. \u201cAn intervention, that\u2019s not something we want. It can\u2019t happen because many people will die. More dead, more misery.\u201d\n\nBut that isn\u2019t to say those in the region object to the humanitarian aid. With skyrocketing hyperinflation, it\u2019s near impossible at present to get basic food or medicine in Venezuela. Violent clashes have spurted up country-wide and millions have fled. So while Maduro and some foreign figures have accused U.S. humanitarian aid of being a deliberate provocation and pretext for intervention, those on the ground don\u2019t necessarily agree.\n\n\u201cPeople say it\u2019s like that, but, honestly, we believe it\u2019s a help,\u201d said Jordes Sira, a 39-year-old Venezuelan who traveled to the border to help pass the aid across the border. \u201cIt\u2019s help and we\u2019re the ones who have to live through what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nAnd to some, the situation is desperate enough to outweigh the serious risks that come with U.S. involvement. Carlos Cangroiz, a Venezuelan migrant who fled to Colombia in October with his wife and children, told me he wants other countries to intervene in Venezuela. It would be a chance to end the starvation and shortages, the hyperinflation, and state violence his country has suffered from for years.\n\n\u201cI left the country for the situation we\u2019re living through,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere we don\u2019t have medicine, where we don\u2019t have food, where our relatives are dying for lack of nutrition or health.\u201d\n\nCangroiz isn\u2019t under any illusions about what intervention would involve.\n\n\u201cI have always said Venezuela is going to see blood,\u201d Cangroiz said. \u201cIn Venezuela, it\u2019s already beginning because he doesn\u2019t want to let go of his power. And the guard continues to defend Maduro. The guard continues to defend this man.\u201d"

    ],
    "text": "In September 2001, President Bush launched what would be called the War on Terror, declaring that the United States was in \u201chot pursuit\u201d of Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban harboring him in Pakistan. \u201cHot Pursuit,\u201d his administration later explained (drawing from the police doctrine with the same name), permitted the United States to go chase Al-Qaeda, et al, wherever it had set up operations. The argument was simple: Al-Qaeda was a \u201ctransnational terror organization\u201d whose bases were \u201cprincipal theater of operations ... not within the territory of the nation that is a party to the conflict\u201d and so chasing it over recognized national borders was justified. It was the \u201chot pursuit\u201d doctrine that was offered up in the aftermath of the balmy May evening when American helicopters entered Pakistani airspace, landed inside a walled compound and killed and carried away the most wanted man in the world\u2014Osama Bin Laden.\n\nThis week, the Indian government decided they could do the same thing. Jaish-e-Mohammad, the organization that they blame for the terrorist attack on soldiers in Pulwama, they insist, has bases in Pakistan. They flew into Balakot, in Pakistani territory, simply because they were attacking a terrorist base operated by Jaish-e-Mohammad. Immediately after, they insisted that they were in pursuit of Maulana Masood Azhar, the leader of Jaish-e-Mohammad. Then they tossed around words like \u201csurgical strike\u201d and then embossed it all with the familiar all-justifying label of \u201cWar on Terror.\u201d Indian news sources declared that a camp had been destroyed and 350 terrorists had been killed. In later statements, the Indian Air Force would qualify this claim somewhat, saying that accurate estimations of casualties could not yet be made.\n\nThe Indian goal behind this reframing is not hard to intuit. With the United States drawing back from the region and talking peace with the Taliban at literally the same moment as the attack on Pulwama, the Indians likely feel uncomfortable being left alone, so to speak, with a Pakistan free from its American minders. Reframing their 72-year-long beef with Pakistan over the disputed territory of Kashmir as part of a larger campaign against terror\u2014something they have argued before, but never to justify a territorial incursion of this magnitude\u2014has distinct advantages, as other countries have also found since 2001. (China has justified brutal repression of the Uyghurs using the war on terror, as well.)\n\nEven the United States had a tough time selling the \u201chot pursuit\u201d doctrine. When a German prosecutor general reviewed the claim in 2015, while considering whether to pursue actions against the United States for the death of a German citizen in a 2010 drone strike in Pakistan, he scoffed at the notion that conflict extends to any counter-terrorism operation, without any territorial limitation. \u201cSuch a blanket justification for acts of war contravenes the underlying spirit of international humanitarian law,\u201d he wrote, \u201cnamely to place the maximum possible constraints on war per se, as well as on the methods by which it is waged and the populations which it impacts.\u201d\n\nThe lack of international law to support its unilateral incursion into Pakistani airspace is not the only problem India faces in trying to reframe the Kashmir conflict, which dates back from Partition at 1947, when Muslim-majority areas of the subcontinent, like Kashmir, were to accede to Pakistan. Owing to machinations of the area\u2019s then-monarch, this did not happen, and since then India, in contravention of UN resolutions, has denied Kashmiris the right to have a plebiscite and decide their own fate."

    "text": "Eventually I was sent with the group of Shopkeepers to the makeup wagon outside. We were waiting for the harassed staff to finish with the group ahead of us\u2014\u201dWhat are you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a Miscellaneous Woman\u201d\u2014when a very young black man in a goatee and round sunglasses wandered up and shook our hands. He looked like a production assistant trying to dress like Spike Lee. \u201cAnybody here speak Arabic?\u201d he asked. \u201cI do, I do!\u201d said Anthony, the guy next to me. \u201cGreat,\u201d said Goatee, and he wandered away to sit in a golf cart and stare off into space. \u201cThat\u2019s him,\u201d whispered somebody. \u201cThat\u2019s who?\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s Singleton. That\u2019s the director.\u201d Anthony, proud at having grabbed an opportunity, took me by the shoulder. \u201cHey,\u201d he asked. \u201cYou know any Arabic?\u201d\n\nMy first glimpse of Jackson was both lucky and brief. I was wandering back into the soundstage, having waited around for more than four hours, when a golf cart shot out. At the wheel was an older man, Jackson\u2019s \u201cchief of security,\u201d and on the right side was a blond woman. Between them was Jackson. His nose and mouth were covered by a black cloth mask, his eyes with sunglasses. He waved languidly to the crew members as he shot by, and vanished around a corner.\n\nI turned and looked back into the north end of the soundstage. That end of the building was empty except for an ultra-deluxe Winnebago, almost completely hidden by black curtains. Two security guards stood nearby. \u201cOur company works for Michael all the time,\u201d one told me. \u201cHe likes us, because we protect his privacy. We keep people away from him, fans, people who are hanging around, extras like you. He\u2019s very sensitive -- if he doesn\u2019t feel safe on the set, he just doesn\u2019t show up. On \u2018Black or White\u2019 he just didn\u2019t show up for two days.\u201d The guard said he liked his employer, although he thought him odd at times. I asked him why Jackson wears the mask. \u201cTo keep out the smog,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd not to be recognized.\u201d The entire crew, I was told later, had to sign agreements not to approach, talk to, or harass Jackson in any way, including asking him for an autograph or simply staring.\n\nAt about 3 p.m., seven hours after we arrived, vans took us to Soundstage 40, the location of the \u201cMarketplace\u201d set. The first shot, which featured the Pharaoh\u2019s guards rooting through the marketplace, presumably looking for the evasive Jackson, went off well. Watching on a monitor, I saw that Anthony had landed a prominent role, playing the Irritated Shopkeeper. He gesticulated wildly and shouted as the guards overturned his baskets and boxes. I hoped he was shouting the line I taught him in makeup, the one Arabic phrase I could remember: \u201cAnna mish khawaga,\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019m not a dumb tourist.\u201d\n\nAfter lunch at 5 p.m., we were back on the set to prepare for the first shot with Jackson. After an hour of rehearsal, everything was set and silence suffused the cavernous stage. A door swung open and two large, well-dressed men entered, followed by an attendant or two, and then Jackson himself, resplendent in his Neo-Egyptian skirt and something resembling a brassiere made from fish scales, followed by his entourage. For a man who didn\u2019t want to attract attention, Jackson certainly knew how to make an entrance. He held the hand of a remarkably beautiful young girl of ten or eleven years; his niece, someone said. Whenever he was not on camera, he was holding her hand. The security guards cleared the way through the soundstage for him, and of course everyone stared, although we tried not to be obvious about it."

    "text": "If you know all this context, you cannot help but approach Afternoon of a Faun wondering: Will this fiction treat historic allegations of abuse in good faith, or not? We do not learn whether the accusation at the heart of the book is true until the novel\u2019s end, although it is treated as false by most of the characters throughout. Marco ropes in the unnamed narrator as a kind of passive accomplice, speaking to him ceaselessly about what he calls his \u201cordeal.\u201d It turns out that the narrator knows Julia, who was an old friend of his family\u2019s and the object of his own youthful crush. When his mother dies and he goes to London for the funeral, he takes the opportunity to drop in on Julia, to ask her the truth. She insists that the rape took place, and he returns to New York as confused as ever. He staunchly maintains an inner neutrality, although he is \u201caware of something suspiciously convenient\u201d about his refusal to take a side.\n\nMarco, the accused, is a talented but self-regarding man, the sort who likes to strike up conversations with waitresses who have no choice but to flatter him. Julia is sane and credible. When the narrator suggests that she has brought forth her claim simply because so many other women are doing the same, she makes the wise rejoinder, \u201cWhat ... exactly ... is wrong with that?\u201d\n\nAfternoon of a Faun succeeds because its villain is our narrator. He is not a villain the way Lasdun\u2019s other men are\u2014he is neither mad nor oblivious. He does nothing illegal, nor even anything obviously wrong. He is a kind, contemplative, loyal man, the sort who hates the idea of harming anybody. When his wife derisively tells Marco that she has had sex \u201creluctantly\u201d plenty of times in her life, the narrator agonizes over memories in which he may have pressured her into sex unwittingly.\n\nBut his complacency and his assumption that the truth will out has disastrous consequences. At the core of his motivations is a certainty: \u201cThe truth might be hard to bring to light, but that didn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t exist, because it did exist: fixed in its moment, unalterable and certainly not a matter of \u2018belief.\u2019\u201d However, his desultory investigations lead nowhere, except to further introspection. While he muses on the unalterable truth, a vicious war rages around him, precisely because the truth of the past is inaccessible.\n\nAt the heart of Afternoon of a Faun, and every one of Lasdun\u2019s novels and his memoir, and Nasreen\u2019s memoir, is this problem: The truth exists as a social phenomenon, agreed upon by group consensus. But gender, for one, divides us from one another, makes it harder for us to communicate and to mutually understand. Under those epistemological circumstances, the \u201ctruth of what happened\u201d becomes an elusive, almost mythical notion. And when madness is involved, the line between truth and fiction goes up in smoke entirely.\n\nNasreen\u2019s memoir is a valuable companion text to Afternoon of a Faun, because they are two books about the same thing: the impossibility of knowing another person\u2019s truth, and the impossibility of ever really being able to communicate what it\u2019s like to live inside your own head. In the style of Charlie Kaufman\u2019s movie Adaptation, which blends lurid fiction with the real-life story of Kaufman\u2019s attempt to adapt Susan Orlean\u2019s book The Orchid Thief, the contents of Lasdun\u2019s fiction took on a strange new life, as part of Nasreen\u2019s mind. So it feels exactly right to read a memoir beside a novel; to read Nasreen along with Lasdun; to mix up events and books and media in the grander project of trying to understand just how badly and how consistently human beings fail to communicate with one another.\n\nThe Afternoon of a Faun is a highly conscientious novel, elegant in its execution and almost humble in its refusal to grandstand, or to turn a story about rape allegations into some didactic allegory. The title is taken from Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s poem L\u2019Apres Midi d\u2019un Faune, the story of a just-woken creature who lusts after a nymph. But I thought, too, of Vaslav Nijinsky, who turned that poem into a much more famous ballet of the same name and wrote a book, the Diary of Vaslav Nijinksy, composed over a period of six weeks as he descended into psychosis. \u201cI seek truth in a book and not the subject,\u201d Nijinsky wrote. Is that a pathological way to see the world? Perhaps. But there is a reason that Lasdun has returned to fiction after his traumatic real-life experience, of which he seemed so certain that the truth was on his side. There may be no clear borderline between the real and the unreal, after all\u2014or at least, neither dimension has a monopoly on the truth."

    "text": "On the surface, Labour\u2019s task should be easy. After two and a half years of Brexit negotiations, Prime Minister Theresa May has failed to build a consensus within her party, let alone Parliament or the country. Her raison d\u2019\u00eatre now hangs like a noose around her neck. There are reports of possible food and medicine shortages and price inflations if no deal is reached. There are weekly cabinet rifts, monthly resignations, and in January, when May finally, belatedly, put her Brexit deal before Parliament, it was voted down by 230 votes\u2014the largest defeat for a government in history.\n\nFor an opposition party, these are surely optimal conditions. And yet, faced with this farce, Labour is either level in the polls with the Conservatives or, on more and more counts, falling behind. Corbyn, whose own approval rating is well below May\u2019s (he has the worst rating of any opposition leader since the 1980s), makes for an easy scapegoat. \u201cThe Tory party is falling to pieces and with a decent Labour leader, it could have been finished off for generations,\u201d James O\u2019Brien, an influential talk show host dubbed \u201cthe conscience of liberal Britain,\u201d said in one characteristic outburst. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to forgive Jeremy Corbyn for his incompetence and his ineffectiveness.\u201d\n\nJeremy Corbyn\u2019s agenda is as much an indictment of Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour as the Conservative Party. JUSTIN TALLIS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThis disbelief, edging on despair, is widely shared. And it\u2019s fed by more than just Corbyn\u2019s alleged incompetence and ineffectiveness. Corbyn stands accused of a dizzying array of charges: a lack of charisma, a ruthless will to power, a callous indifference. Corbyn is described, by turns, as being too principled (pursuing a secret personal desire to leave the EU) and too pragmatic (playing party-politics at a time of national crisis). According to one Guardian columnist, Corbyn exaggerates his disagreements with May \u201cfor theatrical effect\u201d\u2014ultimately they want the same thing. Another liberal critic, playing on the popular perception that Corbyn\u2019s following is a cult, has suggested that the Labour leadership, Communist Manifesto in hand, is \u201ccheering on our steady descent into the abyss\u2014a process they believe will hasten our arrival at the promised land.\u201d\n\nCorbyn\u2019s supporters are accustomed to such attacks and pin the blame for them on a malevolent press and misleading polling. Most of the media, whether the BBC, the Guardian, or the Daily Mail, have been relentlessly hostile toward Corbyn from the start. A 2016 study by the London School of Economics found that nearly 75 percent of coverage misrepresented Corbyn\u2019s views, and Corbyn\u2019s press profile has fared little better since.\n\nMeanwhile, in the 2017 general election, when Labour was even further behind in the polls and Corbyn\u2019s approval rating just as dismal, Labour defied the doubters as its share of the vote soared by the greatest margin since 1945. May had wanted a \u201cBrexit election\u201d and seemed certain of a \u201csupermajority.\u201d But Corbyn stuck to his usual agenda\u2014assailing austerity, inequality, tuition fees\u2014and May was left with a hung Parliament, forced to form a fragile coalition with the small far-right Democratic Unionist Party to remain in government. Corbyn has confounded his critics before, the argument goes, so why won\u2019t he do so again?\n\nYet all this back-and-forth fails to address the unique, paralyzing challenge that Brexit poses to Labour. Brexit, for all its Conservative roots, has opened up an elemental rift within the Labour Party that now threatens its future. This quandary, ethical and electoral, lies beneath Labour\u2019s feet, far below questions of Corbyn\u2019s competence and effectiveness, or his popularity in the polls. The referendum vote cut the country in two, traversing traditional party lines, and, for Labour, landed especially awkwardly.\n\nThe dilemma is clear. The vast majority of Labour wants to remain in the EU: Only ten of the 230 Labour MPs in 2016 voted to leave, while between 80 to 90 percent of the membership and two-thirds of Labour voters wanted to stay. But partly because support for the EU clusters in major cities, the third of Labour voters who backed Brexit is estimated to account for almost two-thirds of Labour\u2019s parliamentary seats. What\u2019s more, 35 of the top 50 target seats for Labour at the next election\u2014those requiring minor swings to switch to Labour\u2014are Leave constituencies.\n\nThe referendum vote cut the country in two, traversing traditional party lines, and, for Labour, landed especially awkwardly.\n\nElectoral abysses lie on either side. If Labour is seen as \u201cenabling Brexit\u201d\u2014in practice, by not backing a second referendum\u2014polls suggest that it could lose as many as 45 seats at the next election. A small Blairite wing of eight Labour MPs has already split to form The Independent Group, joined by several Conservatives, citing the absence of a second referendum as a key reason. Labour\u2019s electoral prospects thus become even bleaker, which is one reason Corbyn finally came out in tentative support of a second referendum on Monday.\n\nBut on the other side, if Labour pitches itself too strongly as the anti-Brexit party, as these splitters suggest, it risks losing not only the Leave constituencies on which it relies\u2014which won on a manifesto that promised to uphold the referendum result\u2014but also the low-hanging seats it must gain at the next election if it is ever to get back into government. With \u201cLeaver\u201d and \u201cRemainer\u201d now the primary ways that people identify politically in the U.K., far above party allegiance, it\u2019s unlikely that this contradiction can be reconciled.\n\nIn this compromised state, many of the moral tenets of so-called Corbynism are called into question as well: that the principled path should be pursued over political expediency; that the membership should be empowered to decide party policy; that the interests of young people\u2014Corbyn\u2019s most reliable voting base and mostly Remainers\u2014would be at the center of his agenda; that Corbyn\u2019s humanitarianism would counter ethno-nationalism\u2019s resurgence in Britain, so emboldened by Brexit and previously appeased by both Blair and Brown. Corbyn\u2019s leadership also promised to re-ingratiate the party with lost heartlands in the North and in Scotland, as it did in the 2017 election, but now, with the former broadly wanting to leave and the latter to remain, they stand opposed to each other.\n\nThere is no easy way out of this. There may be no way out of it at all. But with the Conservative Party still in control of Parliament, with Labour lacking the numbers to win either a second referendum or a general election as it stands, and with Brexit now the key issue on which voters identify, the idea of a Labour leader saving Britain from Brexit is as much a fantasy as the Conservative fever dream of making Britain great again.\n\nFor all their differences, Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party enjoys a strange synergy with the Brexit faithful. Within the space of ten months, between his election as Labour leader in 2015 and the referendum in 2016, both of these onetime fringe political forces upended a status quo that seemed set in stone. And both are now energized by similar structures of feeling: a sense that, somewhere along the way, Britain went astray, with similar turning points imagined\u2014either Britain\u2019s neoliberal transformation under Margaret Thatcher or her decision to join the Single Market.\n\nXenophobia aside, the Brexit campaign could have been a Labour campaign: more money to underfunded public services, overturning an elite consensus, and putting power back in people\u2019s hands. \u201cTake Back Control,\u201d Brexit\u2019s specious slogan, should have been a rallying call for Labour long ago, with its target not Brussels or national borders but social inequality and an over-powerful corporate sector. That this message was instead pushed by Conservatives and the tabloid press, with their own vested interests and rabble-rousing nationalism, only reaffirms just how duplicitous the Brexit campaign really was. But it also represents something of a missed opening for the left.\n\nThe newly established Independent Group includes former members of Labour unhappy with Corbyn\u2019s reluctance to call for a second referendum on Brexit. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nOn one hand, this synergy makes Corbyn a target. In this view, Brexit and Corbyn arrived as one, representing a single, ruinous rupture. For the likes of The Independent Group and their sympathetic supporters in Parliament, the press, and the public, Corbyn\u2019s initial election victory broke British politics as much as Brexit did.\n\nSuch thinking is also at play in the anti-Semitism scandal that has engulfed Corbyn\u2019s leadership. Anti-Semitism is a genuine problem in Labour and the broader British left (gripes with global power structures fold easily into stories of global conspiracy). But it has also elicited an implausible, totemic response from Corbyn\u2019s critics. According to the resignation letter of MP Joan Ryan, as she left Labour for The Independent Group, all previous Labour leaders \u201c[stood] up to racism in all its forms,\u201d while anti-Semitism \u201csimply did not exist in the party before [Corbyn\u2019s] election as leader.\u201d But both Blair and Brown\u2014not to mention their predecessors\u2014often aped the policies and rhetoric of the right when it came to tolerance and diversity. Blair called Muslim veils \u201ca mark of separation\u201d and came close to banning them in schools and hospitals. \u201cOur tolerance is part of what makes Britain, Britain,\u201d Blair said in 2006. \u201cSo conform to it, or don\u2019t come here.\u201d\n\nIn one view, Brexit and Corbyn arrived as one, representing a single, ruinous rupture.\n\nBut on the other hand, the shared resonance between Corbyn and Brexit still stands as an opportunity for the left. The quiet nostalgia of Labour\u2019s new slogan\u2014Rebuilding Britain\u2014makes the connection clear, affirming that, in some important ways, things were once better, and so they can be better again. \u201cThese streets were once full of spirit and hope,\u201d a recent party broadcast declared over footage of a desolate de-industrialized town. \u201cA proud community, where an honest day\u2019s work could earn you a decent day\u2019s pay. Years of austerity have ripped the heart out of this place, but that\u2019s just part of the story: This has been decades in the making. We lost the factories. We lost the jobs. We lost confidence in our community. We lost control.\u201d\n\nFor some, such lamentations are just further evidence that Corbyn is a throwback figure, as anachronistic as Brexit itself. The founding statement of The Independent Group repeated this line of attack, suggesting that Labour under Corbyn was \u201clocked in the old politics of the 20th century.\u201d But for his supporters, Corbyn represents a break from the past, rather than a return to it. From where they stand, nostalgia for a pre-Corbyn, pre-Brexit era makes no sense.\n\nBritain was in a bad way before Brexit and it is in a bad way beyond it. Beneath the hollow Conservative boasts that \u201cmore people are in work than ever before\u201d and the economy \u201chas grown every year for the past nine years,\u201d a bleak set of statistics tells a truer story: Wage growth is at its slowest since records began, some 200 years ago; childhood poverty is forecasted to reach a record high of 37 percent by 2020; household debt is at its highest ever level; homelessness has officially increased by 169 percent since 2010, though the real number is believed to be much higher, such that one person in every 200 in England and Wales is either sleeping rough or in temporary accommodation; in London the figure is 1 in 53; and life expectancy has either stalled or receded\u2014once again, a historic failure.\n\nThe Conservatives\u2019 unwavering, and ongoing, commitment to austerity since 2010\u2014which has starved local councils of funding, depleted essential public services, deepened inequality and resentment, resulted in a reported extra 120,000 deaths, and, according to a recent analysis, shrunk the economy by \u00a3100 billion\u2014has played a key part. But between 1997 and 2010, New Labour was also complicit. Its important successes\u2014reducing child poverty, introducing a minimum wage, investing in public services\u2014were, in Blair\u2019s words, \u201ca spoonful of sugar to help it all go down,\u201d as Labour oversaw an unprecedented financialization of Britain\u2019s economy and all but abandoned working-class voters. \u201cThey have nowhere else to go,\u201d one of Blair\u2019s senior advisers said. And so nowhere they went. By 2010, when Labour achieved its lowest ever share of the vote, the party had shed 1.5 million voters from England\u2019s three northern regions and some 5 million from the working class as a whole.\n\nSo Britain has long been a deeply divided and disillusioned country, home to Western Europe\u2019s richest region\u2014Greater London\u2014and to nine of its ten poorest, making it one of the most unequal countries in the world. This isn\u2019t \u201cBrexit Britain.\u201d This is simply Britain. But while Brexit is not the cause of this condition nor any kind of cure, it also cannot simply be wished away. Corbyn\u2019s hopes of finding unity beyond Brexit appear to be as doomed as trying to find unity through Brexit. \u201cYou\u2019re up against it,\u201d he told Leavers and Remainers in January, stressing their shared struggles, \u201cbut you\u2019re not up against each other.\u201d But given how Brexit identities have hardened on tribal lines, it\u2019s all too likely that they are against each other. Along with everything else, Britain\u2019s chronic economic failings have been subsumed by this crisis of national identity, with no end in sight.\n\nAs to what happens next, nothing is certain. May\u2019s deal is unable to pass Parliament. Each month, she declares she has secured the best possible deal, only to set off in search of a new one. The deadlock must be broken somehow, and so a second referendum seems increasingly likely\u2014not necessarily because Corbyn or Labour\u2019s defectors have taken a stand, but by necessity: a slow exhaustion of alternatives, a stasis with no other escape. Yet there is no agreement on what the question on the referendum would be\u2014the question of the question, as it has come to be called\u2014nor a sense of what a successful campaign to remain would look like.\n\nOne thing is clear: Brexit is not going anywhere soon. For all the resemblances between Corbyn\u2019s movement and Brexit, this is an unhappy coincidence of timing. At the moment when Corbyn arrived to turn the nation\u2019s attention to core issues it had long neglected, Britain decided that it must talk about other things: sovereignty, immigration, the EU. Sometimes, there\u2019s a sense that Corbyn arrived too late, so that he could never really arrive at all.\n\nBut Corbyn\u2019s popularity rests on his politics rather than his personality. And that\u2019s not going anywhere either. The ideas he represents, far more than the man himself, have energized a new generation of voters and widened the realm of political possibility. In an interview after the 2017 general election, Corbyn, now 69 years old, was asked if he was in it for the long haul. \u201cLook at me,\u201d he smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve got youth on my side.\u201d In one sense, it\u2019s a good joke; in another, he is exactly right."

    "text": "To appease their employees, firms are drawing on ideas from an old-fashioned bureaucratic tool kit, adopting the kind of human resource policies they once eschewed in an attempt to impose a layer of accountability between employees and their managers. In November, Google\u2019s CEO, Sundar Pichai, announced that the company would implement new harassment reporting processes and place a greater emphasis on harassment training. Yet the history of HR is one of unanticipated consequences and backlash effects. Policies like the ones Google is putting in place may be ineffective at best, and at worst may entrench gender inequality.\n\nThis has something to do with the origins of the human resource department, which was born not out of beneficence but from companies\u2019 need to defend themselves against ambiguous employment laws. When Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibited employers from discriminating on the basis of race, religion, sex, and national origin, the federal government offered no definition of discrimination. Employers were left to define practices to keep abreast of rapidly expanding employment protections and ensure that they were compliant. These practices were given their own departments. Over time, the departments took on a life of their own, as so many things do in organizations. With annual reports, official procedures, and physical office space, the existence of a division becomes taken for granted\u2014rarely evaluated in terms of its intended purpose. Sociologists Frank Dobbin and John Sutton identify these developments as evidence of the surprising strength of a \u201cweak state\u201d: When the state leaves the laws fuzzy, firms dedicate substantial resources to designing programs that demonstrate compliance. At the behest of management, many HR policies are designed in this spirit, with little regard for whether they instigate substantive improvements for employees.\n\nThe discontent at Google is about more than a single incident. It is a reaction to the persistent problems of diversity and inclusion both at Google and across Silicon Valley. Today, Google is less than 3 percent black, less than 4 percent Latinx, and only 31 percent female (a number that has risen a mere 0.3 percent since 2014, even though Google spent $265 million on diversity initiatives that year and the next). The lack of representation spills over into pay inequality. Google claims to have no pay gap, compensating everyone equally based on their job title and experience, but in 2017, the Department of Labor concluded that there are, in fact, \u201csystemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce.\u201d\n\nTo remedy these problems, the team that organized the walkout submitted a list of five demands. They asked the company to commit to equality of pay and opportunity. The rest of their demands are aimed at curbing the abuse of power\u2014with a safe and anonymous harassment reporting procedure, increased corporate transparency around harassment, and an end to forced arbitration in harassment cases, which often advantages the company over complainants.\n\nGoogle replied with apologies and proposed changes that address each of the five demands. It has promised to end forced arbitration in sexual harassment cases and allow bystanders to participate in the reporting process\u2014both changes that will make a substantial difference to people reporting harassment. When it comes to preventing harassment, however, Google is relying on better education about harassment policies and more frequent harassment trainings. These practices are used almost universally across industries. But they often don\u2019t work."

    "text": "This \u201cvalorization of violence\u201d is something that\u2019s targeted specifically at young men. Even the way clothes are displayed on far-right fashion websites, she says, promotes a hyper-masculine, violent image, with often heavily-tattooed, overly muscular men modeling the clothes. Miller-Idriss found that many of the young men she interviewed used a uniquely German word to describe the brands and the kinds of young men who wore them\u2014gewaltbereit, meaning ready for violence.\n\nOne way that the clothing socializes young men towards extremist thinking, according to Miller-Idriss, is through constant \u201cplayfulness\u201d and game-playing with symbols. Even in countries with lax or no laws against wearing Nazi imagery in public, it\u2019s still not the most socially acceptable thing to stroll around in public with a swastika t-shirt. But the same can\u2019t be said for lesser-known symbols commonly used by white nationalists and neo-Nazis, for example the runic insignia once used by the SS.\n\nThis game is on full display if you browse some of these brands\u2019 websites. One popular Ukrainian brand, Svastone\u2014owned by a musician in a neo-Nazi band\u2014features a logo that could be an oddly drawn diamond, or could be a truncated swastika. A popular Russian brand, White Rex\u2014founded by a notorious Russian neo-Nazi soccer hooligan\u2014sells a shirt with an array of bombs that, when you look more closely, form the number 88.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t see any swastikas or runes,\u201d White Rex founder Denis Nikitin told a Norwegian newspaper in 2017. \u201cThey should be clothes that people are comfortable wearing around town and so that they can recognize each other.\u201d\n\nThis kind of deliberate ambiguity\u2014a \u201cplayfulness of potential interpretations,\u201d Miller-Idriss calls it\u2014isn\u2019t just about skirting the lines between what\u2019s socially acceptable or legal. \u201cIt gives them a sense of power,\u201d says Miller-Idriss. \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand emotionally, that it\u2019s \u2018getting one over on the adults.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also, she said, \u201cone of multiple access points or gateways into far-right extremist scenes.\u201d\n\nFashion bleeds into many other activities of the far right. The Italian neo-fascist CasaPound movement has a clothing label that\u2019s been called the \u201ccommercial rib of CasaPound,\u201d helping finance some of its activities. Kiev-based Militant Zone not only sells t-shirts and CDs in a small shop just off the city\u2019s main square, but organized a neo-Nazi concert in December 2018 that featured \u201cSieg Heil\u201d chants and Hitler salutes.\n\nFar-right fashion can also cross over into far-right violence. White Rex owner Denis Nikitin\u2014also based in Kiev and working with the Azov movement\u2014hosts far-right-linked mixed martial arts events across Europe where he promotes his White Rex brand and its openly white supremacist message; he also reportedly uses income from the brand to fund far-right groups. Nikitin has also met with members of the California-based white supremacist gang Rise Above Movement, whose leaders were arrested in 2018, and allegedly helped train far-right extremists in the UK.\n\nWill far-right fashion catch on in the U.S. like it has in Europe? To go by the photos from some far-right rallies, it already has, at least to a limited extent. It\u2019s certainly not hard for an American to order clothing from many of these European brands or shops online. Nor is the American far-right lacking for any sense of uniform fashion, as the Proud Boys\u2019 co-opting of Fred Perry shirts make clear. And there\u2019s surely no doubt that the United States could be a huge untapped market for European far-right brands.\n\nU.S. far-right fashion culture, however, could prove both less subtle and harder to regulate.\n\nAmerican culture doesn\u2019t have the closetful of native extremist symbols that European far-right fashionistas have at their disposal. A number of symbols employed by Europe far-right fashion brands, Molnar explained, \u201chave been alternately used, embraced, tolerated, banned, later reconfigured and recycled by different regimes and have accumulated multiple layers of meaning.\u201d It gives them an ability to play coy with symbols, like runes appropriated by the SS. Aside from symbols like the Confederate flag or the Gadsden \u201cDon\u2019t tread on me\u201d flag, Molnar pointed out, there\u2019s no well the American far-right can reach into to pull out similarly ambiguous or repurposed icons. In short, American symbols are more explicit, requiring less \u201cdecoding\u201d to understand. The Klan hood is not exactly subtle. Instead, in the U.S., according to Miller-Idriss, most existing fashion that could be dubbed far right focuses on pro-veteran, pro-2nd-amendment and overtly Islamophobic themes.\n\nThe option often tried in Germany\u2014banning far-right clothing brands\u2014won\u2019t work in most public places due to American free speech protections. Insofar as U.S. schools want to try it, though, there\u2019s a pretty clear lesson from abroad: The bans on their own aren\u2019t effective. \u201cThey can even backfire and increase the appeal of the far-right by making clothing and symbols a space for easy rebellion and anti-authoritarian expression,\u201d Miller-Idriss said. What matters is the discussion: Many of the youth in Germany she interviewed where far-right brands like Thor Steinar were banned \u201cdid not understand why certain brands are banned\u201d; to them \u201cit just seemed like one more arbitrary rule to follow.\u201d U.S. educators, she said, \u201cneed to be clear with students and parents about what their thinking is about banning, what values are being defended and why.\u201d\n\nFailing to have that conversation cedes ground to the far right by default. For, whether it\u2019s a Ukrainian store selling a shirt with the SS\u2019s Totenkopf (death\u2019s head) and the logo of British neo-Nazi terror group Combat 18, or an Italian brand with a picture of a motorcycle and the words \u201cBORN TO WIN: WHITE RACE,\u201d or a Hungarian shirt with the words \u201cRise above democracy,\u201d the brains behind Europe\u2019s far-right fashion brands are perfectly clear about the kind of values they\u2019re defending."

    "text": "The Green Party\u2019s Green New Deal is indeed more expansive. It includes far more detail than Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s resolution, and a much more aggressive, socialist reorganization of society. The two plans have the same goal of 100 percent renewable energy by the year 2030, and they both call for universal health care and a federal job guarantee. But the Green Party\u2019s plan calls for single-payer Medicare for All, tuition-free college, and \u201cdemocratically run, publicly owned utilities.\u201d To pay for it, the Greens call for major progressive tax and financial reform, including a 90 percent tax on bonuses for bailed out bankers, and a reduction in military spending by 50 percent.\n\nGreens say their Green New Deal is the only version that\u2019s going to reduce emissions to the degree scientists say is necessary to prevent climate catastrophe, because it\u2019s the only one that\u2019s truly socialist. \u201cThe mobilization that would need to take place to solve climate change would have to upend the capitalist economy,\u201d Schlakman said. Hawkins agreed. \u201cYou can\u2019t have an economy structured around endless growth,\u201d he said. \u201cGrowth has to happen on a basis that is ecologically sustainable, and that won\u2019t happen if you leave it to market incentives.\u201d The Democratic Green New Deal flirts with these ideas, but doesn\u2019t fully commit to them.\n\nThis is why some Greens say the 2020 presidential race is not a challenge so much as an opportunity to expose Democrats. \u201cThere is this growing cafeteria socialism where Democrats pick and choose elements here and there and put them on a platter because they sound conducive to running a progressive-sounding campaign,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cIf you are espousing Medicare for All and free college for everyone, but ultimately still allowing for capitalist interests to run amok \u2026 then you are not a socialist. You\u2019re just running on a platform that draws people in falsely.\u201d\n\nCalling Ocasio-Cortez a fake progressive is a risky game, given that she\u2019s one of the most popular Democrats in America. But it does seem like the natural place for the Green Party to go in 2020. Third parties, after all, are historically for people who not only dislike the two major parties, but don\u2019t believe the major parties will ever change. \u201cI think if you work within the Democratic system, you have to be incredibly honest about who the Democrats are, which is that they are pro-capitalism, very moderate, and don\u2019t want to move very far left to tackle the challenges we see worldwide,\u201d Schlakman said. \u201cSure there\u2019s an avenue for socialists to upend the Democratic Party from the inside, but they\u2019d really have to be at war with their own party. And I don\u2019t see that in Congresswoman Cortez.\u201d\n\nThe chances of a socialist revolution within the Democratic Party is unlikely. Only one of its presidential candidates even uses that term to refer to himself, with the modifier \u201cdemocratic\u201d\u2014and Sanders isn\u2019t even a member of the party. So the Green Party surely still appeals to those who want the American economy to become fully eco-socialist\u2014an inconsequential niche of voters, electorally speaking. But that\u2019s not to say the party is without political influence. The Greens\u2019 history as a spoiler threat might keep the Democrats honest, ensuring they don\u2019t nominate a moderate who won\u2019t at least entertain Medicare for All and the Green New Deal.\n\nThen again, leftist voters may be so motivated to remove Trump from office that they\u2019d hold their noses and vote for, say, Amy Klobuchar or Joe Biden.\n\n\n\n\u201cKeep thinking that,\u201d Hunter warned. \u201cWe\u2019ll be out here knocking on doors.\u201d"

It\u2019s completely different.\u2019\u201d The GABI initiative, along with several other pilot programs in New York, are part of a major effort by ACS to counteract its image as a \u201cbaby-snatching\u201d police force riddled with the same racial and economic biases that beset actual law enforcement in the United States. Together, the programs amount to an experiment: to see whether one of the largest child welfare agencies in the country can change the dynamics that have poisoned its relationship with the vulnerable families it seeks to serve and must oversee. It\u2019s a sort of idealistic gamble, deeply informed by critics who charge that child welfare agencies like ACS unfairly target the poor and the nonwhite, and treat all family crises with the hammer of child removal.\n\n\u201cIt used to be in the Bronx projects that all you had to do was shout, \u2018There\u2019s a cop in the hall,\u2019 and people would flee,\u201d said Martin Guggenheim, a law professor at NYU and a national expert on child welfare. \u201cNow you say, \u2018ACS is on the ground,\u2019 and people flee. That\u2019s one of the saddest parts: This is a helping agency, meant to support poor families, and the parents are terrified of the very agency whose charge is to support them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was so scared,\u201d one woman said, describing her terror when ACS banged on her door in the middle of the night. \u201cI thought they were going to take my kids.\u201d\n\nChanging the way a massive bureaucracy has done business for decades is no small task. Success relies not simply on new, more benevolent programs like GABI, but also on convincing ACS\u2019s community partners\u2014the private groups contracted to provide foster care and preventive services\u2014to embrace a new mission. It means convincing the holders of city and state purse strings\u2014the ACS budget is $2.7 billion for 2019\u2014to invest in experimental programs whose success won\u2019t be calculable for years, and whose failures will be splashed across the media, potentially costing government officials their jobs. Above all, it entails convincing families who, for generations, have viewed ACS as a threat, to give it another chance.\n\nIf successful, though, ACS could create a more benevolent model for child welfare that would be followed in other cities and states. ACS, which conducts more than 60,000 investigations of families each year, is one of the largest child welfare agencies in the country\u2014dwarfing many other states\u2019 agencies entirely. Its size alone guarantees that whatever happens here becomes a national model. \u201cEveryone in child welfare agrees that what\u2019s going on in New York City is relevant to the work happening elsewhere in the country,\u201d said Guggenheim. Instead of a government bureaucracy that is widely perceived as punitive and biased against the poor, ACS could transform itself into the type of agency that it wants to be: a resource families can turn to in times of trouble.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something to be said for why ACS partnered with us,\u201d Murphy said to the mothers at the St. George GABI center. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to operate out of fear, and they really want to be here to support people.\u201d The women nodded, considering the idea. Finally, one of them spoke, \u201cSo you\u2019re saying they want to change?\u201d\n\nIn January, Jennifer McClure photographed families at the GABI center in Staten Island. She then gave the parents and children art materials and invited them to draw on and decorate the images.\n\nFor more than 150 years, child welfare policies have swung back and forth between two polarized notions of how best to serve vulnerable children: Should they be removed from troubled homes, or should their families be helped? Should \u201cchild protection\u201d be the guiding principle, or \u201cfamily preservation\u201d? Where society lands on these issues has always depended on prevailing attitudes toward poverty. Reformers have long argued that taking children from poor families does nothing to address the root problem of poverty. In June, for example, Democratic Representative Gwen Moore of Wisconsin, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus who, as an 18-year-old college student, was temporarily forced to relinquish her own child to relative foster care, introduced the Family Poverty Is Not Neglect Act, which stipulates that children can\u2019t be removed from families solely on the basis of poverty-related issues. \u201cI went through the system, and was humiliated, and mistreated,\u201d Moore said in a 2017 interview. \u201cI see that there is a deliberate effort to destroy these families.\u201d Moreover, children who are placed in chronically overtaxed foster care programs experience long-lasting trauma and, as studies have shown, far higher risk of teen pregnancy, incarceration, unemployment, and homelessness, compared to children who are left in families with similar problems. Conservative critics, however, have essentially argued\u2014particularly during America\u2019s periodic drives to crack down on welfare\u2014that parents who can\u2019t support their families are, by definition, unfit.\n\nFor decades, child welfare policies have swung between two competing notions: Should kids be removed from troubled homes, or should their families be helped?\n\nFrom the mid-1800s through 1929, New York City and other Eastern cities arrived at a draconian solution, shipping as many as 250,000 children from impoverished tenement families West to the expanding U.S. frontier. Children placed on \u201corphan trains\u201d were offered for adoption at depot stops and churches along the way. (To modern eyes, many of those adoptions more closely resembled indentured servitude.) Then, in the 1910s, the pendulum swung the other way, as a movement arose to supply pensions to \u201cdeserving\u201d single mothers, particularly widows, so they could safely raise their children at home. (What minimal help that was offered, though, was restricted almost entirely to white mothers, as were the New Deal\u2019s welfare provisions two decades later.)\n\nIn the 1960s, things changed again, when the concept of child abuse was \u201crediscovered\u201d by a group of doctors that included C. Henry Kempe, a pediatrician who coined the term \u201cbattered child syndrome.\u201d Kempe\u2019s label\u2014which he described as deliberately \u201cprovocative and anger-producing\u201d\u2014helped lead to the establishment of mandatory child abuse reporting laws across the country. The idea was widely embraced, notes journalist Nina Bernstein in The Lost Children of Wilder, her account of the legal battle to reform New York City foster care, because casting child abuse as a \u201cclassless\u201d phenomenon\u2014no more endemic to the poor than the rich\u2014allowed politicians to isolate child welfare spending from the larger anti-poverty programs of the Great Society, which were by then already losing support.\n\nBut the focus on child abuse, which might seem a positive, child-oriented development, resulted in demonizing parents\u2014most often parents of color\u2014whose children suffered because of the environments they were born into. \u201cWhat was understood by some advocates as a social problem rooted in poverty and other social inequalities became widely interpreted as a symptom of individual parents\u2019 mental depravity,\u201d notes social critic Dorothy Roberts in her book Shattered Bonds: The Color of Child Welfare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been a classless problem, and it certainly is not today,\u201d said Gottlieb. \u201cIf legislators say, \u2018We\u2019re going to pour these billions into supporting poor families,\u2019 it won\u2019t go anywhere. If we say, \u2018We\u2019re going to protect children from abusive parents\u2019\u2014if we label a demon\u2014then the money can follow that.\u201d In the child welfare system today, she said, \u201ceverything we do for families is set up around the idea that \u2018We have to protect our children from you.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the 1970s, the class-action lawsuit Wilder v. Bernstein took aim at racial discrimination within the private agencies that handled New York City\u2019s foster care with taxpayer support, but which systematically excluded black children. Black children at the time were relegated to harsh, decrepit juvenile reformatories, in which, in some cases, more than 80 percent of the kids hadn\u2019t committed crimes but were simply would-be foster children. The racial disparity was so stark, Nina Bernstein notes, that the superintendent of one facility called it \u201ca plantation.\u201d By the time Wilder was settled in 1986, almost 15 years after it began, the city\u2019s foster care system was starting to explode amid the aids and crack epidemics. By the early 1990s, there were nearly 50,000 children in the system\u2014almost all of whom were black.\n\nPolitics at the national level only made matters worse, as the political establishment turned against welfare and began to argue explicitly that parents who needed support to raise their children had no business keeping them. In 1994, Newt Gingrich put it most bluntly: \u201cWe\u2019ll help you with foster care, we\u2019ll help you with orphanages, we\u2019ll help you with adoption\u201d\u2014but not, as Bernstein noted, with money for family preservation, a position that was echoed in the Contract With America that Gingrich proposed later that year. By 1997, when Congress passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act, establishing a tight timetable for terminating parental rights and offering foster children for adoption, the campaign against keeping families together had become so forceful that one magazine headline read, \u201cfamily preservation\u2014it can kill.\u201d\n\nThe force of the pendulum swing between child protection and family preservation is often driven by high-profile tragedies. In New York in 1995, Elisa Izquierdo, a six-year-old girl from Brooklyn, was brutally beaten to death by her mother after repeated reports of abuse from neighbors and Izquierdo\u2019s school went unheeded by the city\u2019s Child Welfare Administration and other city and state agencies. The case became a national scandal. Time magazine published a haunting photo of the girl on its cover, under the title, \u201ca shameful death: let down by the system, murdered by her mom, a little girl symbolizes america\u2019s failure to protect its children.\u201d The Child Welfare Administration was abolished, and ACS was created in its stead.\n\nIzquierdo\u2019s death sparked what has become a familiar pattern of overcorrection, common in the aftermath of such tragedies, in which child welfare officials ramp up family separations, in an effort to avoid another catastrophic \u201cmiss.\u201d Through the mid-\u201990s, notes a recent report by the Center for New York City Affairs, a policy research institute at the New School, the ACS caseworkers\u2019 union even counseled its members with the grim slogan, \u201cWhen in doubt, pull \u2019em out.\u201d And they did: In the three years following Izquierdo\u2019s death, the number of children taken into ACS custody increased by 50 percent.\n\nFamily preservation advocates like the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform call this a \u201cfoster care panic.\u201d It is hardly unique to New York. In the two years following the 1993 murder of a toddler in Illinois, the state\u2019s foster care system grew by 44 percent, rendering Illinois children more likely to end up in state custody than anywhere else in the United States.\n\nBut the need to intervene more is the wrong lesson to take from tragedy. \u201cChildren fall through the cracks not because child welfare agencies are devoting too much to family preservation,\u201d Dorothy Roberts writes, but \u201cbecause agencies are devoting too much to child removal.\u201d When there are too many children in foster care, she argues, there are neither enough foster homes to care for them, nor enough caseworkers with adequate time to identify those children who are truly at risk. Indeed, NCCPR notes, three years after the foster care panic began in Illinois, child deaths in the state had increased by 17 percent. Moreover, the focus on child protection creates perverse incentives for caseworkers and welfare agencies. \u201cThere has never been a preventive services worker in the history of child welfare who has ever been penalized for not helping a family enough,\u201d said Gottlieb. \u201cBut they are penalized all the time for not doing enough to protect the kid.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, a similar panic flared again, following the deaths in New York of two children whom ACS had left in their homes. That September, a six-year-old boy from Harlem named Zymere Perkins was allegedly beaten to death by his mother\u2019s boyfriend just weeks after an ACS caseworker closed his case. Two months later, three-year-old Jaden Jordan of Gravesend, Brooklyn, died. ACS had received an anonymous report that the boy was being kept in a dog crate, but for two days, caseworkers couldn\u2019t locate him, because they had been given the wrong address, and staff didn\u2019t know how to find the correct one in their system. Like Perkins, Jordan was allegedly beaten to death by his mother\u2019s boyfriend.\n\nThe ensuing public outcry was tremendous. \u201cHow ACS Failed Him,\u201d read the headline of a New York Post article detailing the abuse Perkins suffered. The city\u2019s other tabloid, the Daily News, lambasted Perkins\u2019s caseworker with a cover story that declared, \u201cshe let him die to get promoted.\u201d Then\u2013ACS Commissioner Gladys Carri\u00f3n, a reformer who had focused on preventive services intended to keep children out of foster care, resigned under pressure.\n\nSince then, ACS has been eager to repair its image. In June, it launched a public relations campaign featuring videos and subway ads with children and parents who\u2019d been involved with the system declaring, \u201cACS fought for my family.\u201d In June, the agency unveiled a \u201cCPS appreciation week,\u201d to honor New York City\u2019s child protective specialists, its \u201cfirst responders\u201d for children. And its new commissioner, David Hansell, who succeeded Carri\u00f3n in February 2017, has been courting the media in an effort to improve public perception of the agency.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of terrible tragedies,\u201d Hansell told me, \u201cand the dynamic we\u2019ve seen over and over again\u2014not just in New York City but across the country\u2014is that a terrible tragedy happens, it gets a lot of attention in the public, there are investigations, and so on. It leads the child welfare agency to be reactive and defensive and to be more draconian.\u201d He vowed to address this cycle by focusing on the root causes that underlie tragedies like child deaths, rather than seeking individuals or communities to blame.\n\nYet from 2016 to 2017, the number of children placed in foster care in the city increased 13 percent. Hansell attributed the increase not to caseworker reactiveness but to a rise in public reporting\u2014up 7 percent since 2016. However, in the year and a half following Perkins\u2019s death, ACS has also presided over a 54 percent increase in the number of cases it brought to family court, and a roughly 30 percent increase in emergency removals\u2014when ACS takes a child from parents before even seeing a judge. As a result, warned a July report from the Center for New York City Affairs, ACS staff caseloads have increased, families have been put on months-long waiting lists to receive preventive services, and family courts have been so swamped with cases that attorneys say it\u2019s led to \u201ca new level of dysfunction,\u201d with delays and deferrals \u201cthat impact every family in the system.\u201d\n\nI got a sense of this when I visited the Bronx Family Court, an imposing brutalist structure not far from Yankee Stadium. In June, in a windowless waiting room on the seventh floor, I watched a distraught young mother\u2014African American, like almost everyone else there\u2014approach the court clerk and two white lawyers who were complaining about the bad courthouse Wi-Fi and their children\u2019s college grades.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, what\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked. Her court- appointed attorney had left New York without anyone telling her, and her new lawyer hadn\u2019t shown up. \u201cI come every time [ACS] sets court appointments, and they never show,\u201d she said. The clerk apologized, then looked to one of the attorneys, who was there representing ACS: Maybe he should talk to the agency about why the mother\u2019s caseworker hadn\u2019t been in touch. The mother walked back to a wooden bench, where a young boy and an adult man waited silently. \u201cThis happens every day,\u201d she said, angry to the point of tears.\n\nInside one of the courtrooms, another African American woman, middle-aged, with braids pulled into a side bun, sat at the center of a U-shaped table, listening as her public defender explained that she\u2019d been accepted to an in-patient substance abuse program that allows parents to keep their children with them. A court-appointed guardian, there to represent the woman\u2019s young daughter, objected, saying it was too soon to place the child back in the mother\u2019s custody, and that the city should wait to see if she could stay sober. An ACS attorney concurred, arguing that the mother should only be allowed to see her daughter before entering rehab if she passed a drug test that day. The judge agreed to both requests, then asked the lawyers about their vacation plans before setting a date to reconvene in a month. The mother, whom no one had addressed directly, started to cry.\n\n"

    "text": "\u201cWhen push comes to shove, he is a supporter of a social democratic Scandinavian-style welfare state in the form of better education, healthcare and social service provisions for the general population rather than the confiscation of companies from the private sector,\u201d wrote Larry Liu in a prescient post in 2015 about the re-emergence of red-baiting.\n\n\n\nSanders has articulated his brand of democratic socialism as being about improving the lives of lower and middle-class Americans who have been left behind. \u201cWhen I use the word socialist\u2014and I know some people aren\u2019t comfortable about it\u2014I\u2019m saying that it is imperative\u2026 that we create a government that works for all and not just the few,\u201d he said in a 2015 speech articulating his political philosophy. \u201cI don\u2019t believe government should own the means of production, but I do believe that the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth of America deserve a fair deal.\u201d\n\n\n\nSanders\u2019s loss to Hillary Clinton could have quieted the questions about socialism\u2019s rise in America. Instead, Clinton lost to Trump, and Sanders\u2019s ideas gained even more traction on the left. So have the politics he represents. Since 2016, membership in the Democratic Socialists of America has increased from 6,000 to nearly 60,000. Today, nearly every major Democratic candidate embraces some form of universal health care, along with a host of other ambitious policies aimed at curbing inequality and climate change. Does that make them actual socialists, though?\n\n\n\nRepublicans think so, or at least want voters to think as much. They\u2019re returning to what has been a standard playbook for Republicans, beginning in the McCarthy era and continuing to this day. Over the last 80 years, as recently detailed by historian Kevin Kruse, everything from the polio vaccine to the interstate highway system to the Civil Rights Act have been labeled as \u201csocialism\u201d by opponents. Under President Obama, Republicans argued that bailout programs and providing market-based affordable health care were examples of a turn towards socialism. Trump, per usual, has taken his party\u2019s hyperbole to a new level: Embrace universal health care today, he warns, and end up like crumbling Venezuela tomorrow. There is no recognition of less extreme examples, like Britain\u2019s single-payer system or the successful democratic socialist economies of Nordic countries; socialism can only lead to economic collapse and authoritarianism.\n\n\n\nTrump: Socialism promises prosperity but it delivers poverty https://t.co/SNVjTXPOPb \u2014 Selylove (@hu06734367) February 22, 2019\n\nThese attacks from the right are being aided by many in the media, who are pressing Democratic candidates about their devotion to \u201csocialist\u201d positions. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar has built the early phase of her campaign around presenting herself as a sensible Democrat, out to improve social programs but not make them universal. This, in turn, has led The New York Times to frame the early stages of the Democratic primary as being a battle between \u201cpragmatism\u201d and \u201cideology.\u201d Senator Cory Booker, a co-sponsor of the Medicare for All bill, has taken to warning supporters that it will be difficult to pass. Harris, the only candidate besides Sanders to advocate for the abolition of private insurance, has said on the campaign trail that only parts of the Green New Deal will be able to become law. As The Washington Post reported earlier this week, candidates are \u201cbeing pressed from one side by core Democratic voters hungry for leftist policies favored by the most energized activists and, from the other, by the need to court centrist voters who could be alienated by the party\u2019s turn to the left.\u201d But they are also increasingly being pushed by members of the media to declare an allegiance between socialism and capitalism.\n\n"

    "text": "The idea that the journey is more significant than the destination, out of which Cavafy made something imperishable, is one of the controlling platitudes of American popular culture, and accounts for some of the consolation that Americans find amid confusion and also some of the forgiveness that they practice toward themselves. It must have originated in a time when journeys were interesting\u2014when travel was an experience and not a suspension of experience. Surely we lost our sense of voyage when we stopped boarding ships. There is no more evocative emblem of the vicissitudes of destiny, of the grand drama of forward movement, than a ship, or a tossed ship. It was such a ship, a square-rigged frigate on a choppy windswept sea, which was chosen as the emblem of The New Republic when it was founded a hundred years ago, first in a handsomely executed etching in the rich realist style of the day and years later in a highly stylized version. This was not the ship of state. This was the ship of the life of the mind, which (as the ideological lurchings of this magazine demonstrated over the decades) is often at sea.\n\nThe artist who drew our ship was Robert Hallowell, an interesting man\u2014\u201ca curious mixture,\u201d one historian has written, \u201cof quiet charm, social idealism, practical business sense, and aesthetic sensibility.\u201d Hallowell was a painter who served as the business manager and the publisher of The New Republic from 1914 until 1925, when he divorced his wife (the editor Charlotte Rudyard, an interesting woman) and left the magazine to devote himself to his art. His cityscapes, executed under the French influence, have a certain pictorial integrity, and are useful documents of New York City in the late 1920s and the 1930s; they showed in Paris and New York to good notices. But Hallowell never captured darkness. A photograph of him in 1935, presenting to Harvard his portrait of his former roommate John Reed, shows a dandy with lively, probing eyes. Bruce Bliven, in his memoir of his editorship of the magazine, reports that Hallowell and his family \u201clived in poverty.\u201d In 1935 and 1936 Hallowell was assistant director of the Federal Arts Project, and he was working on a WPA mural when he died in 1939.\n\nThe ship that Hallowell chose to represent The New Republic was Walt Whitman\u2019s ship. There are many ships in Whitman, of course; he is oceanic in more ways than one. \u201cAre they not all the seas of God?\u201d The ship in Hallowell\u2019s engraving referred to the one in \u201cPassage to India,\u201d a long poem in thirteen sections that Whitman wrote (and pasted together) in the spring of 1870 and published a year later in a separate volume with other poems, until they were all absorbed into Leaves of Grass. Beneath his image of the ship Hallowell chose to cite some lines (along with some words that I cannot find in the poem) from Whitman\u2019s poem\u2014\u201cPassage to you, to mastership of you, ye strangling problems!\u201d\u2014thereby transforming Whitman\u2019s cosmic rhapsody into a prooftext for technocracy, which rather suited the spirit of the new progressive journal. Not much else in the poem did suit its spirit, though. Certainly not this: \u201cHave we not darken\u2019d and dazed ourselves with books long enough?\u201d In truth, \u201cPassage to India\u201d is a vatic mess. It is all exclamations and exclamation points, a flaccid mysticism in an athletic delirium. It is one of the works that announces the religiose post\u2013Civil War Whitman who would make \u201cno more attempts at smart sayings or scornful criticisms,\u201d the histrionic white-bearded prophet whose visions sound increasingly like ravings and speak less for himself and more for the universe.\n\nAnd yet the poem may still serve us whose calling it is to make sense of our moment. \u201cPassage to India\u201d begins with an ecstatic celebration of the wonders of modern engineering\u2014the Suez Canal, the American railroad, the Atlantic cable. These revolutions in communication and transportation inspire some startlingly premonitory lines: \u201cLo, soul! Seest thou not God\u2019s purpose from the first? / The earth to be spanned, connected by network, / The people to become brothers and sisters. / The races, neighbors, to marry and be given in marriage, / The oceans to be crossed, the distant brought near, / The lands to be welded together.\u201d Has technology, or globalization, ever been treated more lyrically? Connected by network! But then Whitman reveals his complete scale of values, and the engineers are demoted. They are heroes, but not the highest ones. \u201cAfter the seas are all cross\u2019d, (as they seem already cross\u2019d,) / After the great captains and engineers have accomplish\u2019d their work, / After the noble inventors\u2014 after the scientists, the chemist, the geologist, ethnologist / Finally shall come the Poet. ...\u201d An age of scientific exploration is to be succeeded by an age of spiritual exploration. \u201cIndia\u201d stood for Columbus\u2019s terrestrial goal, for all terrestrial goals, but the twelfth section of the poem proclaims a \u201cpassage to more than India!\u201d (Hallowell included this line in his caption.) \u201cAre thy wings plumed indeed for such far flights?\u201d Whitman\u2019s subject is finally the soul, which he addresses with mounting rapture; and the breakthroughs in convenience and comity made possible by science turn out to be insufficient to the soul\u2019s needs, which are not terrestrial. The telegraph and the railroad can alter the world, but they cannot bestow an inward illumination. The soul seeks \u201cprimal thought\u201d and \u201csuperior universes.\u201d The lazy vagueness of such concepts does not quite vitiate the force of the poet\u2019s claim that matter is not all there is, that the material is a highway to the immaterial. In its florid way, then, the poem enacts an ascent from the technological to the spiritual. Whitman\u2019s affirmative abandon has the ironic consequence of providing a critical context. He \u201csings\u201d technology and then he puts technology in a lesser place, and denies it an ultimate authority over human existence. This is the itinerary of the ship. May it also be our own."

    ],
    "text": "Which brings us to a risk unique to the twenty-first century: climate change. According to the 2018 report by the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, humanity has only 12 years left to prevent global warming from reaching levels that would result in the poverty of millions and the greatest displacement of people in the history of humanity as they flee extreme drought and floods. Such events also tend to involve violent conflict. The political community\u2019s tepid response to climate change so far, with world leaders like Donald Trump and Jair Bolsanaro refusing to acknowledge global warming as real, let alone as urgent, makes it hard to be optimistic. Given the very real possibility that life will be much worse for the next generation as a result of the global instability, some, recent trend pieces report, are thinking twice about becoming parents.\n\nOne might argue that, like Benatar\u2019s catalogue of human suffering, this response is overly pessimistic. Hardship is nothing new. Life can be meaningful despite it, and sometimes even because of it. Strife gives you something to work towards, purpose; it\u2019s what gives life meaning, not what makes it meaningless.\n\nBut if climate change causes wars to break out, would one still choose to birth children into a high likelihood of violent death? And if the looming 12-year deadline is missed, and further temperature increases become statistically inevitable, what purpose could life have in the face of an unavoidable, collective downfall? At least people living today still have the agency to change things. But bringing children into a decaying world, without even the opportunity to do something about it, seems a cruel fate to inflict on someone, especially your own child.\n\nThe great question is whether that fate is inevitable. During the Cold War, there was an existential fear about a possible nuclear war between America and the USSR, which would have brought about mass death and suffering. Instead, political history and fortune took a turn that made nuclear annihilation less likely\u2014even though the risk of a nuclear war may since have risen. Going further back, around the turn of the nineteenth century, the English economist Thomas Malthus was warning that the pending overpopulation of the planet would lead to inevitable food shortages. That didn\u2019t happen either. Technological advances have allowed the planet to feed a population many times its nineteenth-century tally of one billion. So, even if we can\u2019t see it from our current vantage point, there is hope that politics, technology, or a combination of the two might retrospectively render our current anxieties exaggerated. But, of course, there is no guarantee of that\u2014hope comes with its own risks.\n\nHaving children, some could argue, is a way of making that hope more realistic. While some environmentalists have suggested lowering birth rates to reduce greenhouse emissions for those who remain, there is also another side to the issue: Young people today care deeply about the environment and their activism is needed as political pressure. Young people will also be the future scientists and engineers that we need in order to come up with technological solutions to global warming that are still unavailable. Both these \u201cgreater good\u201d arguments for and against procreation, unfortunately, amount to using future children as a means to an end, thinking about how they can contribute to our overall welfare, rather than thinking of their own individual well-being."

    "text": "For Dempsey and scores of viewers who watched the surveillance video, the shooting death of Small was a clear-cut crime. When the shooting was first reported in the media, Isaacs and the New York City police department said that Small had exited his car and repeatedly punched Isaacs in his face through Isaacs\u2019s car window. Isaacs said he feared for his life, a justification that has been routinely deployed by police officers when they use deadly force on African Americans. But the video, Dempsey said, \u201cis like truth serum.\u201d\n\nFour days after the shooting, the footage was leaked, disputing the police account. The family thought the video would be enough to prove that Isaacs had used excessive force. \u201cThat was our hope,\u201d Dempsey said. \u201cThat was our redemption. That was our justice.\u201d So when the murder trial inside Brooklyn Supreme Court ended with a not-guilty verdict in the fall of 2017, \u201cit was literally like losing him twice,\u201d Dempsey told me. \u201cIt was like he got killed in front of us again.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo these videos don\u2019t mean anything,\u201d he added. \u201cSo now, what the hell matters?\u201d\n\n\n\nVictor Dempsey, brother of Delrawn Small, says the video of Small\u2019s death is seared in his mind. \u201cI can look at it without looking at it,\u201d he says. Erik McGregor/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nSocial scientists have a theory about \u201clinked fate\u201d: In the African American community, individual life chances are recognized as inextricably tied to the race as a whole. So when black people watch a video of police violence against another black person, they see themselves or their loved ones in that person\u2019s place, knowing that the same fateful encounter could very well happen to them. \u201cIt\u2019s an image now stuck in your head forever,\u201d said Monnica Williams, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Connecticut who specializes in race-based trauma. \u201cYou carry that horror around with you.\u201d Viewing such images, various studies show, induces stress, fear, frustration, anger, and anxiety. There is also preliminary evidence suggesting that these images could lead to a cascading series of physical ailments, including eating and sleeping disorders, high blood pressure, and heart problems.\n\nWilliams said that viewers also start to think differently about their world. They feel their future is limited, while any symbol of the police can impart a sense of fear and dread. The images \u201cremind them of the cheapness of black life,\u201d Muhammad said. This feeling deepens when these videos showing violent black death are treated by the media as death porn or perverse entertainment. \u201cTo just have black bodies laying out on the street,\u201d Williams said, \u201clike roadkill for everybody to see\u2014this is dehumanizing and traumatic.\u201d\n\nThere is also concern that viewers might eventually become inured to these images, indelible as they are, which might dampen efforts to hold accountable the police officers and the criminal justice system. Conversely, such repeated footage can also make some viewers so piercingly aware of police violence that they instinctively disengage from the police rather than risk facing them. For weeks, Denzell Jackson, 22, a barber and truck driver from Pittsburgh, continuously watched the eyewitness video of police firing gunshots at 17-year-old Antwon Rose as he ran away from them. \u201cTo remind myself of what could, can, and most likely will happen at anytime,\u201d Jackson told me. \u201cEveryone needs to be aware.\u201d The video intensified his fears of police. Jackson said, \u201cI\u2019m scared for my life any time a cop is around.\u201d\n\nHe is not alone. In many black communities, residents hesitate before calling the police\u2014either because officers rarely show up, or because of fear of what may happen if they do. When Dave Reiling called 911 in Sacramento, California, last year to report that someone had broken into his truck, the officers who responded shot his 22-year-old neighbor Clark, a father of two, eight times in Clark\u2019s grandparents\u2019 backyard, killing him. Clark was unarmed. His name was soon trending on social media, and when police released body cam video of how his shooting unfolded, posts were viewed more than one million times. \u201cIt makes me never want to call 911 again,\u201d Reiling, who is white, told the media. \u201cThey shot an innocent person.\u201d\n\nThis trauma is compounded when videos reveal what seems to be a clear case of excessive or unnecessary police force, only for the officers involved to not face charges or be acquitted, routinely by a mostly white jury.\n\nIt is not only videos of police violence that traumatize black viewers, but also the response from commenters once the footage has been posted. On social media, some users blame the victim in \u201cwhy didn\u2019t he just\u2026\u201d or \u201cshe should have just \u2026\u201d admonishments. Some white Americans \u201cdon\u2019t understand, see, or appreciate our reality,\u201d said Williams of the University of Connecticut. \u201cThey walk around in a very privileged space so they don\u2019t even see racism that\u2019s happening in front of them.\u201d The result, Williams said, is that \u201cthey are constantly hurting us.\u201d And a seemingly innocuous response, or no response at all from friends, to a video of police violence on social media can carry over into everyday life, causing some black Americans to mask their pain and anger in spaces such as the office or a dinner party.\n\nThis trauma is compounded when videos reveal what seems to be a clear case of excessive or unnecessary police force, only for the officers involved to not face charges or be acquitted, routinely by a mostly white jury. When Gregory Hill Jr., a soon-to-be married father of three, was shot through his garage door, media published a haunting image of Hill lying in a pool of blood. The Florida jury that deliberated the wrongful death case awarded the family just $4 in damages. In response to the ruling, the Hill family lawyer told the media: \u201cThis says, black lives don\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe saw Eric Garner get choked to death,\u201d said Kesi Foster, a 36-year-old youth community organizer based in Brooklyn. \u201cWe saw Saheed Vassell get shot down. We saw Ramarley Graham run into his house. And the mayor says nothing is wrong here, go about your day. There is no accountability for being executed on the street.\u201d Foster and the teens in his program have regularly joined families of police violence at rallies to call for justice and reform. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant struggle in trying to navigate it,\u201d he said of the images and their repercussions, \u201cin a way that\u2019s not paralyzing or traumatizing.\u201d\n\nAfter the funeral for his son Saheed, which was attended by hundreds of people, Eric Vassell watched, over and over, the surveillance video of Saheed being shot and killed in their Crown Heights, Brooklyn, neighborhood by police officers. He would pause it. He would slow it down and count the seconds: one, two, three, four, five. Five seconds, Vassell counted, for the unmarked police car to turn onto a street nearby his family\u2019s home, and for four officers to start firing at his son. Police said Saheed had pointed an object at them, which two callers to 911 had previously identified as a gun or possible gun. The object was actually a piece of a welding torch. Vassell keeps a photo of it on his cell phone as evidence that the shooting of his son by police was unjustified. \u201cSaheed should still be alive today,\u201d Vassell told me. The state attorney general has opened an investigation into the shooting.\n\nMonths after Saheed was buried, parts of Crown Heights are still in mourning. Some of the local businesses display pictures of him in their windows. Many owners remember Saheed as a child, when he would volunteer to do odd jobs for customers, like carrying stuffed grocery bags for a dollar. Vassell is often stopped on the street in the neighborhood. People, some of them strangers, hug him and ask, \u201cPops, how you holding on?\u201d His wife still cries every day.\n\nEric Vassell says he believes the death of his son, Saheed, will lead to reform. He is demanding that the police officers who shot Saheed be arrested and prosecuted. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nBut Vassell steels himself with the belief that Saheed was sacrificed to raise awareness about police violence\u2014and to ultimately facilitate reform. He has been waiting for the city to release the police department\u2019s unedited footage of the shooting, as well as the names of the four officers who shot and killed Saheed, all of whom he thinks should be arrested and prosecuted for his son\u2019s death. He said he has also sued the city for $25 million. \u201cBut what could they give me?\u201d Vassell asked. \u201cThere is no amount. My pain will always remain.\u201d\n\nTo Vassell and other people whose lives have been shattered by police violence, justice lies in police accountability, which includes full access to city surveillance footage and police records. He\u2014along with Eric Garner\u2019s mother and Delrawn Small\u2019s brother and sister\u2014have called for the repeal of a New York state law that they say shields bad police officers\u2019 personnel files and allows for racially biased and violent officers to continue policing communities. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 34 states and the District of Columbia have laws for body cameras. But in some states, to the frustration of impacted family members, activists, and local politicians, such footage is not public record, or local governments can limit how much footage is released.\n\n\n\nIn some cases, it is clear why police would want to keep their behavior hidden.\n\nAfter body-cam footage was posted of a BART officer in West Oakland fatally shooting 28-year-old Sahleem Tindle three times in the back last January, as he wrestled on the ground with another man, it has been viewed more than 10,000 times. The media had reported that police initially said Tindle had been wielding a gun. Still, Tindle\u2019s mother, Yolanda Banks-Reed, told me, \u201cI don\u2019t just want likes and shares, I want help.\u201d\n\nBanks-Reed went on to found Mothers Fight Back, writing letters, making calls, storming city meetings, and demanding justice for her son and police reform from elected officials. She, like Vassell, also wanted the officer who shot and killed her son to face criminal charges. Over the summer, she organized a rally at the state capital that included audio recordings of mothers who had lost children to gun and police violence. About three months later, in October 2018, the county prosecutor declined to file criminal charges against the officer involved. The officer reasonably believed, the investigation concluded, that he was acting in self-defense and the defense of others.\n\nSome videos that refute police accounts have aided in indictments and convictions. In August 2018, Roy Oliver, a police officer in Texas who shot and killed 15-year-old Jordan Edwards, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for Edwards\u2019s murder. Police camera footage played a key role in the trial: Edwards and four other high-schoolers were driving away from what a 911-caller had described as a rowdy house party in a Dallas suburb when Oliver fired five shots into the teens\u2019 car. Before his arrest, Oliver said that their vehicle had backed toward his partner, and that he feared for his partner\u2019s life. But the footage played for jurors showed the car backing up then driving away, past Oliver and his partner. One leaked clip showed Edwards\u2019s stepbrother exiting the car with his hands up pleading with officers: \u201cPlease help us. He\u2019s dead. Please don\u2019t shoot me.\u201d\n\nThe advent of new technologies has allowed us to chronicle and testify to a horribly entrenched truth: The American justice system continually, daily devalues black bodies.\n\nStill, the videos may not have been the decisive factor in the court case. During the trial, Oliver\u2019s partner essentially testified against him, saying he did not fear for his life, and did not think he would be hit by the teens\u2019 car.\n\nUltimately, Williams said, video accounts alone have brought about few, if any, substantial police reforms. They have brought widespread awareness that implicit racial bias indeed exists within police departments. However, that basic fact is now bitterly, painfully clear, and the question is what comes next for America, in terms of actual change. \u201cThis isn\u2019t rocket science,\u201d said Muhammad of Harvard. \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t want more of them to strengthen the case.\u201d\n\nThere have been efforts to counter the \u201cblue wall of silence\u201d ingrained in police culture. Voters in some cities have ousted longtime prosecutors and replaced them with officials who promised, during their campaigns, to hold police officers accountable. Some family members of those killed by police\u2014like Michael Brown\u2019s mother, Lezley McSpadden\u2014have announced bids for local political offices. (McSpadden is running for City Council in Ferguson, Missouri.)\n\nSome police departments have introduced de-escalation and implicit bias training. Last year, the District of Columbia\u2019s police department even made it mandatory for officers to visit the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture. It is hard to measure what, if any, impact the exposure will have on police relations with black communities. Delores Jones-Brown, a professor at John Jay\u2019s College of Criminal Justice, pointed out that several departments now tell their officers they have a \u201cduty to intervene\u201d when they witness one of their own involved in illegal or questionable behavior during encounters with the public.\n\nMeanwhile, justice in the courtroom largely remains elusive. After a Chicago police officer shot and killed Laquan McDonald in 2014, initial police reports ruled the shooting justified. Then, thirteen months later, the police department released damning dash cam video of McDonald walking away before an officer began shooting at him, 16 times in total. In October 2018, the officer was convicted of second-degree murder. In January, a judge sentenced the officer to six years and nine months in prison. The former officer must serve two years of his sentence to be eligible for probation.\n\nThe sentencing came as a disappointment on social media. Commenters like Kevin Covington, who watched footage of the shooting, said that the amount of prison time was not nearly enough and that the whole trial felt like a sad, horrid joke. \u201cIt just confirms what you feel,\u201d Covington, the 51-year-old father of two sons and a college administrator in Philadelphia, where he works with an enrichment program for young, black males, told me. \u201cIt used to be your word against their word. Then, \u2018Wait until there\u2019s a video,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt just brings me to the point of these things happen because white America stills view black people in one way: dangerous. Like, you don\u2019t have any rights to be here. It\u2019s our reality today and has been for too long.\u201d\n\nThe advent of new technologies has allowed us to chronicle and testify to a horribly entrenched truth: The American justice system continually, daily devalues black bodies. It has only been forced to reckon with the reality of its own bias when a flash of video shows, in soul-wrenching detail, the ease with which a life can be extinguished. This revelation comes at a cost to the well-being of African Americans across the country who are exposed to these images at the swipe of a finger or the click of a mouse. And so far, with precious little to show by way of significant and lasting reform, the cost has been too high."

    "text": "Cohen adopted a penitent mien before Congress on Wednesday. \u201cI am ashamed of my own failings, and I publicly accepted responsibility for them by pleading guilty in the Southern District of New York,\u201d he said in his opening statement. \u201cI am ashamed of my weakness and misplaced loyalty\u2014of the things I did for Mr. Trump in an effort to protect and promote him. I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump\u2019s illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience.\u201d On multiple occasions, Cohen reminded lawmakers that he would not benefit from his testimony, and that it would not reduce the length of his upcoming prison sentence.\n\nOn Trump himself, Cohen gave a familiar portrait of the president: mercurial, strangely charismatic, and driven by unvarnished self-interest above all else. \u201cMr. Trump is an enigma,\u201d he told the committee. \u201cHe is complicated, as am I. He has both good and bad, as do we all. But the bad far outweighs the good, and since taking office, he has become the worst version of himself. He is capable of behaving kindly, but he is not kind. He is capable of committing acts of generosity, but he is not generous. He is capable of being loyal, but he is fundamentally disloyal.\u201d\n\nThat paradox was a recurring theme in his testimony. \u201cEverybody\u2019s job at the Trump Organization is to protect Mr. Trump,\u201d he later told lawmakers. He even confirmed that Trump\u2019s presidential run was a publicity stunt to enrich Trump further. \u201cMr. Trump would often say, this campaign was going to be the \u2018greatest infomercial in political history,\u2019\u201d he told the committee. \u201cHe never expected to win the primary. He never expected to win the general election. The campaign\u2014for him\u2014was always a marketing opportunity.\u201d Making America great again was a racket, in other words, and the American people were the marks.\n\nIn Cohen\u2019s telling, Trump uses vague and elliptical statements to instruct his subordinates to commit wrongdoings on his behalf. \u201cMr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how he operates.\u201d Instead, Cohen said, Trump would \u201clook me in the eye\u201d during the campaign and say that he wasn\u2019t conducting business in Russia\u2014even while Cohen worked on his behalf toward a Trump hotel project in Moscow. \u201cIn his way, he was telling me to lie,\u201d he explained.\n\nThis description of Trump\u2019s behavior is all too familiar. Former FBI Director James Comey documented how Trump repeatedly tried to elicit his loyalty during their one-on-one interactions in early 2017, telling him that he \u201cneeded loyalty.\u201d Though Trump did not directly order Comey to drop the investigation into former national security advisor Michael Flynn, he made his intentions plain. \u201cI hope you can let this go,\u201d Trump reportedly told the FBI director shortly after Flynn\u2019s ouster that February. The investigation continued apace, and Comey was fired four months later.\n\n"

    "text": "Laymon starts his story when he is a 12-year-old boy who weighs 213 pounds. His mother, an educator, instructs him to speak the Queen\u2019s English and write book reports on politicians. Laymon follows his mother\u2019s instructions, but he\u2019s more focused on getting near his crush Layla who will be at a nearby swimming pool. All Layla wants to do is float in the deep end of the pool but that desire comes with a price: she has to allow the other teenage boys to run a train on her first. After Layla asks Kiese to accompany her to the pool, Kiese notices something is wrong with her, as it is with him but no one can say what. There\u2019s no resolution to this scene. We don\u2019t know if Layla is ever satisfied in Kiese accompanying her. We don\u2019t know whatever happens to those guys. This is the point\u2014to show how sex and violence can become an almost unremarked feature of daily life.\n\nAll the while, Kiese is losing focus on his assignments. When his mother confronts him, he asks if she can help him lose weight. He writes, \u201cI stood there watching you, feeling a lot about what it meant to be a healthy, safe black boy in Mississippi, and wondering why folk never talked about what was needed to keep black girls healthy and safe.\u201d He does not tell his mother why he\u2019s so distracted, but his experience of witnessing harm is a current that courses through the entire book.\n\nThe harm Laymon writes about can also be intergenerational. Kiese\u2019s mother often uses corporal punishment. But she is also abused herself. During a twice-a-week therapy session, she professes her concern that Kiese is eating and drinking things that he shouldn\u2019t be whenever he\u2019s angered and Kiese responds, \u201cI drank Mason jars of box wine three times when there wasn\u2019t anything else to eat or drink because it\u2019s sweeter than water.\u201d His biological father is out of the picture, and Malachi, his mother\u2019s boyfriend, is both abusive and erratic in his love and attention. When his mother and Malachi make love\u2014loudly and vigorously\u2014Kiese gorges upon sweets and more boxed wine, which leaves him so inebriated that he cannot finish his report on Fannie Lou Hamer. The physical evidence of this difficult relationship with his mother\u2014in which so much is left unsaid\u2014is that Kiese weighs almost 300 pounds before he graduates from high school.\n\nOnce Kiese enters Millsaps College, a private liberal arts institution in Jackson, he seeks to leave behind the safety net of eating, and he forsakes meat, eggs, bread, and sugar. He loses over 70 pounds in a single summer. He forms a relationship with a co-ed named Nzola, though they\u2019re often divided by the ways they each grapple with racism on campus. She wants him to understand the gravity of misogynoir and he says that he does; however, he does not broadcast the issue when the press reaches out to him about the tensions at the institution. Nzola also abuses Kiese, often punching him in the face. Just at the moment when Kiese is starting to love his body, another person assaults it\u2014because they are both suffering under the weight of institutionalized oppression.\n\nIn both his account of Nzola\u2019s violence and Malachi\u2019s, Laymon strikes a very delicate balance. He addresses intimate violence but immediately places both situations in the wider context of cycles and patterns of abuse: \u201cWe hated where we were. We hated ourselves. We hated fighting, fucking, fighting, fucking, fighting over who was most violated by a spiteful college president, confused white classmates, and the gated institution we paid to attend.\u201d He does not label himself as a victim, a choice that may seem controversial for some. He\u2019s not holding either Malachi or Nzola accountable and calling them abusers outright, perhaps because he is still working with his traumatic memories. His reassessment of abuse is an exploration of feelings and motives from both parties as well as the systems that affect them both."

    "text": "The response was explosive. Democrats like Representative Ted Lieu of California suggested impeachment proceedings could arise from Trump\u2019s apparent obstruction of justice. Even House Judiciary Chair Jerry Nadler, who has cautioned against a rush to impeachment, asserted, \u201cWe know that the President has engaged in a long pattern of obstruction,\u201d before promising, \u201cThe @HouseJudiciary Committee\u2019s job is to get to the bottom of it, and we will do that work.\u201d (The House Judiciary Committee would oversee any impeachment inquiry.)\n\nThe alarm wasn\u2019t limited to Democrats. White House spokesperson Hogan Gidley, after claiming to Fox News that media outlets were \u201cjust using innuendo and shady sources,\u201d still did not deny the story. Fox\u2019s Chris Wallace, while warning to take the BuzzFeed story \u201cwith a giant grain of salt,\u201d admitted, \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of thing that can get you impeached.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that William Barr, Trump\u2019s nominee to be attorney general, agreed twice in his confirmation hearing last week that if a president encouraged someone to testify falsely it would amount to obstruction of justice. Barr agreed that a president\u2014or any person\u2014who persuades a person to commit perjury or change testimony would be committing obstruction. Barr also concurred when Senator Lindsey Graham asked, \u201cIf there was some reason to believe that the president tried to coach somebody not to testify or to testify falsely, that could be obstruction of justice.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s lawyers were apparently so anxious that, according to multiple news outlets, they \u201craised concerns\u201d in a letter to Mueller\u2019s office. And according to The Washington Post, the office of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein called Mueller\u2019s office to find out if he would be releasing a statement.\n\nWhen the statement from Mueller\u2019s office finally dropped, the discussion of impeachment, which had rapidly grown rampant, was curbed. But what we know so far indicates that Trump, in at least one previously known case involving Don Jr., scripted someone to lie under oath, which means that all the concerns voiced by Democrats and Fox News anchors in response to the BuzzFeed story remain as valid as ever. It\u2019s the kind of thing that can get you impeached.\n\nFurthermore, the special counsel\u2019s statement did not exonerate the president, rare as it might be for his office to rebuke the press. The statement merely distinguished what that office had obtained in its investigation from what BuzzFeed said the office had obtained. That\u2019s significant because, in Cohen\u2019s case, Mueller\u2019s prosecutors are working with another Justice Department office, the Southern District of New York, on parallel prosecutions. Indeed, FBI agents working with SDNY conducted the raid on Michael Cohen\u2019s home in April, gathering information that was then shared with Mueller\u2019s people.\n\nIndeed, there are notable differences in the way the two prosecutions characterize the degree to which Trump\u2014referred to as Individual-1 or Client-1 rather than by name\u2014directed Cohen\u2019s illegal conduct. With respect to hush payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, Cohen admitted in the SDNY case that he acted \u201con Client-1\u2019s instruction, to attempt to prevent [women alleging to be the Candidate\u2019s former sex partners] from disseminating narratives that would adversely affect [his] Campaign.\u201d By contrast, in Mueller\u2019s case, Cohen claimed that, when he lied to Congress about the Trump Tower deal in Moscow, he was \u201cseeking to stay in line with\u201d the message Trump and \u201cWhite House-based staff and legal counsel to Trump\u201d were pushing regarding Trump\u2019s ties to Russia.\n\nThat is, in pleading guilty to SDNY prosecutors, Cohen said Trump \u201cinstructed\u201d him to take action. But in pleading guilty to Mueller\u2019s prosecutors, Cohen said he was following the messaging of Trump\u2019s advisers, without claiming to have been instructed to do so. In both cases, however, Cohen said loyalty to Trump led him to commit crimes to sustain Trump\u2019s desired message.\n\nThis dynamic may be why it has been so hard for other news outlets to do what BuzzFeed did: to state that Trump induces his aides to lie, not just as a routine matter, but also in ways that break the law. Trump gets those around him to lie in a different manner than past presidents.\n\nUnder Trump, the lies are facilitated not through any kind of bureaucratic genius, but instead through an insistence that underlings toe the public line.\n\nConsider how some of George W. Bush\u2019s most disastrous lies worked. With both the claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and that the CIA was just vigorously interrogating detainees rather than torturing them, Bush\u2019s top aides either ensured he retained plausible deniability to the lies or his public claims were technically correct. It was technically true that, \u201cThe British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.\u201d Left unsaid was that the U.S. government had already judged that Saddam didn\u2019t actually obtain the uranium he sought.\n\nWith Bush\u2019s lies, the buck often stopped with Vice President Dick Cheney. And Cheney exploited his bureaucratic genius, both inside and outside government, to ensure message discipline. One reason Cheney started collecting information on Valerie Plame and her husband Joe Wilson\u2019s trip to Niger, in an effort that would lead to the disclosure of her CIA status, was because CIA analysts close to Plame were leaking details of what the CIA had really known to the press. Similarly, people close to Cheney had a hand in the consistent use of \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d in the most secret realms of government, in memos rubber-stamping the torture, and on the front page of The New York Times.\n\nThere is no such plausible deniability in the Trump administration. Under Trump, the lies are facilitated not through any kind of bureaucratic genius, but instead through an insistence that underlings toe the public line. These lies include more innocuous ones like inauguration attendance, as well as more serious ones involving Trump\u2019s awareness that a Russian linked to military intelligence was brokering a $300 million real estate deal at the same time that Russia\u2019s military intelligence was offering dirt stolen from Trump opponent\u2019s server to his son.\n\nIn fact, that\u2019s the theory presented in all three of Mueller\u2019s cases in which a Trump aide lied about matters pertaining directly to Russia\u2019s involvement in the campaign. Under oath, Cohen explained that he lied about the Trump Tower deal \u201cto be consistent with Individual 1\u2019s political messaging and out of loyalty to Individual 1.\u201d\n\nIn his sentencing memo, George Papadopoulos said his lies about Russians offering the campaign Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails were not meant to impede the investigation but \u201cto save his professional aspirations and preserve a perhaps misguided loyalty to his master.\u201d By his own account, Papadopoulos lied \u201cout of loyalty to the new president and his desire to be part of the administration.\u201d\n\nAnd in explaining why former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn told lies\u2014which included false statements to the FBI about his communications with the Russian ambassador to the U.S.\u2014the government said, \u201cBy the time of the FBI interview,\u201d Flynn \u201cwas committed to his false story.\u201d We know that Flynn took those actions, in part, to avoid a \u201ctit-for-tat escalation\u201d that would make it difficult to improve relations with the Russians after they had just \u201cthrown [the] USA election\u201d to Trump, according to Flynn\u2019s deputy K.T. McFarland.\n\nMueller has hinted that Trump\u2019s other subordinates were involved in just one of these lies: Cohen\u2019s. In a filing describing how Cohen explained \u201cthe circumstances of preparing and circulating his response to the congressional inquiries,\u201d Cohen suggested he coordinated with \u201cWhite House-based staff and legal counsel to Trump.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what the public record shows happened with Don Jr.\u2019s statements about the Trump Tower meeting, in which he falsely claimed there was no \u201cfollow-up.\u201d** Trump dictated that line himself in July of 2017, and his camp has never deviated from it.* Trump Organization lawyers urged Rob Goldstone, who set up the meeting, to endorse the claim. They did this even though they had to have known it wasn\u2019t true. Indeed, less than a week after Trump\u2019s lawyers tried to get Goldstone to back him up, Trump\u2019s assistant forwarded Goldstone an email he sent her the prior year, showing it to be false.\n\nSo where do all the lies come from? The record indicates that Trump decides what lie is going to be told, and the people around him, indirectly or otherwise, do what they need to sustain it, even if it includes lying to Congress, the FBI, and Mueller\u2019s team.\n\n\n\nLegally, the difference between ordering someone to lie and simply ensuring they follow your message out of abject loyalty may not save Trump. There is one law, subornation of perjury, that imposes up to five years in prison if a person \u201cprocures another to commit any perjury.\u201d Even aside from whether Trump personally directed his aides to tell lies, the crime Trump\u2019s aides, including Cohen, have been prosecuted for thus far has been false statements, not perjury. A more basic law makes it a crime to \u201caid, abet, counsel, command, induce, or procure\u201d an offense against the United States, in which case that person can be charged \u201cas a principal.\u201d In past presidential cover-ups, conspiracy to obstruct justice was charged. So Trump could be on the hook for the lies he encouraged his subordinates to tell, too, sometimes with the help of his lawyers.\n\nIn this administration, the president doesn\u2019t need to order his subordinates to lie for him. It\u2019s a daily matter of course. Mueller\u2019s team seems to be wise to that, even if Congress and much of the media aren\u2019t quite there yet.\n\n*A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Donald Trump asserted to his team in 2016 that there was no follow-up to the Trump Tower meeting. He made the assertion in 2017. We regret the error.\n\n**A previous version of this article incorrectly attributed a statement claiming there was no follow-up. The statement was made by Donald Trump Jr., not Michael Cohen."

    ],
    "text": "The Green Party\u2019s Green New Deal is indeed more expansive. It includes far more detail than Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s resolution, and a much more aggressive, socialist reorganization of society. The two plans have the same goal of 100 percent renewable energy by the year 2030, and they both call for universal health care and a federal job guarantee. But the Green Party\u2019s plan calls for single-payer Medicare for All, tuition-free college, and \u201cdemocratically run, publicly owned utilities.\u201d To pay for it, the Greens call for major progressive tax and financial reform, including a 90 percent tax on bonuses for bailed out bankers, and a reduction in military spending by 50 percent.\n\nGreens say their Green New Deal is the only version that\u2019s going to reduce emissions to the degree scientists say is necessary to prevent climate catastrophe, because it\u2019s the only one that\u2019s truly socialist. \u201cThe mobilization that would need to take place to solve climate change would have to upend the capitalist economy,\u201d Schlakman said. Hawkins agreed. \u201cYou can\u2019t have an economy structured around endless growth,\u201d he said. \u201cGrowth has to happen on a basis that is ecologically sustainable, and that won\u2019t happen if you leave it to market incentives.\u201d The Democratic Green New Deal flirts with these ideas, but doesn\u2019t fully commit to them.\n\nThis is why some Greens say the 2020 presidential race is not a challenge so much as an opportunity to expose Democrats. \u201cThere is this growing cafeteria socialism where Democrats pick and choose elements here and there and put them on a platter because they sound conducive to running a progressive-sounding campaign,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cIf you are espousing Medicare for All and free college for everyone, but ultimately still allowing for capitalist interests to run amok \u2026 then you are not a socialist. You\u2019re just running on a platform that draws people in falsely.\u201d\n\nCalling Ocasio-Cortez a fake progressive is a risky game, given that she\u2019s one of the most popular Democrats in America. But it does seem like the natural place for the Green Party to go in 2020. Third parties, after all, are historically for people who not only dislike the two major parties, but don\u2019t believe the major parties will ever change. \u201cI think if you work within the Democratic system, you have to be incredibly honest about who the Democrats are, which is that they are pro-capitalism, very moderate, and don\u2019t want to move very far left to tackle the challenges we see worldwide,\u201d Schlakman said. \u201cSure there\u2019s an avenue for socialists to upend the Democratic Party from the inside, but they\u2019d really have to be at war with their own party. And I don\u2019t see that in Congresswoman Cortez.\u201d\n\nThe chances of a socialist revolution within the Democratic Party is unlikely. Only one of its presidential candidates even uses that term to refer to himself, with the modifier \u201cdemocratic\u201d\u2014and Sanders isn\u2019t even a member of the party. So the Green Party surely still appeals to those who want the American economy to become fully eco-socialist\u2014an inconsequential niche of voters, electorally speaking. But that\u2019s not to say the party is without political influence. The Greens\u2019 history as a spoiler threat might keep the Democrats honest, ensuring they don\u2019t nominate a moderate who won\u2019t at least entertain Medicare for All and the Green New Deal.\n\nThen again, leftist voters may be so motivated to remove Trump from office that they\u2019d hold their noses and vote for, say, Amy Klobuchar or Joe Biden.\n\n\n\n\u201cKeep thinking that,\u201d Hunter warned. \u201cWe\u2019ll be out here knocking on doors.\u201d"

    "text": "Communist Vietnam chose not to embrace the dynasty model. Instead, its wartime leadership was marked by a star system of national heroes who came and went: the nationalists Ho Chi Minh and General Vo Nguyen Giap, later giving way to the hardline communist Le Duan and the peace negotiator and Nobel winner Le Duc Tho. The eldest sons of these men did not expect to inherit the top post. Many of them, in fact, were suspicious of the North Korean personality cult. After 1975, amidst galloping post-war inflation and food shortages, Vietnam abandoned the \u201cstar system\u201d of leaders entirely, setting up a stable of bureaucrats who made more routine and systematic decisions, decentralized across regions and factions. More people had input, and more urged for change (unlike North Korea, where the word of the de facto monarchy is like a page out of the Bible). The result was d\u00e9tente.\n\nThe second crucial reason North Korea is unlikely to open up in the near future is that its continued war on paper with the U.S. and South Korea is a source of great legitimacy for its regime. United Nations Command and North Korea signed an armistice, not a peace treaty, halting the Korean War fighting of 1950 to 1953\u2014but not formally ending the conflict. South Korea refused to sign.\n\nTo this day, North Korea\u2019s regime is built on the idea of the enemy everywhere, of the need to prepare its people for an impending American invasion. Propaganda warns of the never-ending emergency and the need to protect the pure and innocent North Korean people, a master race under threat. North Korean schoolchildren have learned math by adding up how many \u201cAmerican bastards\u201d are killed in battles. When I visited a North Korean elementary school two years ago, I was taken aback, but not surprised, by the nuclear missiles painted on the walls, and the playground with slides in the shape of tanks and fighter jets.\n\nAs long as North Korea has no peace treaty or unification with South Korea, it has an enemy. You don\u2019t open the economy to your enemy.\n\n\n\nNorth Vietnam reunified with South Vietnam by force, completing the revolution that gave the communist party so much legitimacy in the eyes of its supporters. The Communist Party of Vietnam had to find a new \u201crevolution\u201d to peddle to its people, so it promised growth and abundance, heralding projects like its accession to the World Trade Organization in 2005. Vietnam has every reason to keep warming up to the U.S., its biggest trading partner. And such economic success based on free trade ironically keeps the communist party in power.\n\n\n\nThose suggesting North Korea follow the Vietnamese model probably aren\u2019t thinking of having Kim Jong Un annex South Korea. They\u2019re thinking of economic liberalization as an unstoppable, magical force transcending politics\u2014which has repeatedly been the mistake people make when assuming North Korea is forever on the brink of change. The men I met in Ho Chi Minh city doubtless returned to Pyongyang with plenty of action items. I\u2019ve yet to see them on the nightly news, technocrats at the forefront of a vast North Korean economic policy overhaul.\n\nVietnam had the right leaders, despite their well-documented flaws, at just the right time\u2014as the Cold War was winding down, and the markets were set to open globally. North Korea has no such benefit."

    "title": "The Future of Meat Is Vegan",
    "authors": [
      "Rachel Riederer"
    ],
    "text": "Though Reese\u2019s arguments are compelling, he doesn\u2019t believe that this kind of reasoning is what will ultimately drive a change. He expects that to come from advances in animal-less meat technology, and from the growing problems with production of food from animals. \u201cThe ace in the hole for the inevitability of the end of animal farming,\u201d he asserts, \u201cis the incredible inefficiency of making meat, dairy, and eggs from animals.\u201d That is, an animal\u2019s body does more than produce meat\u2014it builds bones and hair, it breathes and moves and senses, all of which consume energy, so that for every one calorie of meat produced, a farm animal takes in ten calories or more. Lab-grown meat doesn\u2019t perform any of these functions, of course, and so it has a much higher caloric conversion ratio than animals, which are, in Reese\u2019s words, \u201cinefficient producers of flesh.\u201d\n\nHe profiles some of the main companies in the meatless technology field, which he hopes will take clean meat mainstream. Hampton Creek, now called JUST, creates plant-based alternatives to eggs and dairy, and wants to target average consumers, not just vegans. Impossible Foods takes an analytical approach to isolating the components and characteristics of meat, and builds plant-based versions that have more in common with animal flesh than with the veggie burgers and Tofurkeys of yore. Beyond Meat makes products similar to those from Impossible Foods, but whereas Impossible Foods was initially marketed to restaurateurs like David Chang, Beyond Meat goes for the home cooks, selling to Whole Foods and other grocery chains.\n\nFor all these companies\u2019 efforts, Reese is also aware that changing people\u2019s diets and food cultures\u2014which foods they consider delicious or luxurious, or which they incorporate into traditional dishes\u2014is a deeply social project. He recognizes that advocates for animal-free food will need to work on social change, to ensure that as the technologies continue to develop (\u201cwhich seems fairly inevitable\u201d), people actually choose to eat the products. If scientists and businesses lead, recipes must follow.\n\nReese\u2019s book isn\u2019t likely to win the hearts and palates of many meat eaters. Its tone is coolly dry, bordering on mathematical. Part of this comes from Reese\u2019s commitment to effective altruism, whose adherents say they use \u201cevidence and careful analysis to find the very best causes\u201d rather than \u201cjust doing what feels right.\u201d It might be a refreshing shift in tone from the extreme compassion and occasional sanctimony that can surround arguments for animal welfare, and it\u2019s certainly a sensible way to organize the activities of an advocacy group\u2014but as the engine of a work of nonfiction, the constant emphasis on efficiency runs a little cold. Even Reese\u2019s discussion of suffering itself is mathematical, as he calculates the amount of harm a farm does by the number of animals it keeps and the number of hours they spend there, without accounting for differences in their consciousness. He gives the suffering of a fish the same weight as the suffering of a pig.\n\nYet despite its structure and tone, the book\u2019s underlying argument itself is important. Reese makes plain that eating meat causes an enormous amount of avoidable pain and suffering, and refuses to accept ignorance as an excuse. Most people have long known that farmed chickens live in tight wire cages where they go crazy with stress, or that hogs will get so depressed that they don\u2019t fight back when nearby animals bite their tails. People who know these facts and eat meat anyway (I do both) may tell ourselves that it\u2019s just the way things are, or cultivate an internal moral firewall, refusing to think about the processes that brought our protein to our plates.\n\nReese also rejects measures intended to make eating animals a little less morally objectionable. Michael Pollan has, for instance, envisioned not the abolition but the transformation of animal farming, into a system in which animals can live outdoors, \u201cin contact with the sun, the earth, and the gaze of the farmer,\u201d and in which consumers know where their meat comes from. A neat way to make the industrial meat system kinder, he thought, might begin with simple visibility: \u201cMaybe all we need to do to redeem industrial animal agriculture in this country,\u201d he wrote in The New York Times Magazine, \u201cis to pass a law requiring that the steel and concrete walls\u201d of the slaughterhouses \u201cbe replaced with \u2026 glass.\u201d Then, surely, conditions would have to improve. Why end the practice altogether when the cruelties can be eliminated?\n\nReese concedes that some smaller specialty farms might operate more ethically than the factory behemoths, but insists that exploiting sentient beings \u201cis a moral misdeed even if those sentient beings live happy lives.\u201d Most significantly, he argues that these specialty farms provide a \u201cpsychological refuge\u201d for meat eaters, who can take solace in the fact that they sometimes eat ethically farmed meat, even though most meat isn\u2019t produced this way. By occasionally choosing the \u201chappier\u201d meat option, people are able to imagine that their choices don\u2019t contribute to the big, brutal system, that the meatballs on their kitchen table have nothing to do with those shadowy stories about deranged chickens and terrified cows.\n\nAgain, he\u2019s right. Cruelty is all but impossible to eliminate from an industrialized meat-production system that prizes profitability above all else. Up to the 1940s and \u201950s, typical animal farms in the United States were pasture-based and raised various types of animals. Now they are concentrated operations\u2014the term of art for a factory farm is a \u201cconcentrated animal feeding operation,\u201d or CAFO. This consolidation has made it possible for Americans to eat more meat, more cheaply, and it has brought horrific conditions. The current system tasks workers with stunning live birds by dunking them in electrified water and docking the tails of pigs, in settings where the primary concern is keeping costs low. (Pollan pointed out that in ancient Greece, slaughter was entrusted to priests: \u201cpriests!\u2014now we entrust the job to minimum-wage workers.\u201d) In 2018, the average American ate more than 200 pounds of red meat and poultry, a record high. The way this plentiful meat is produced is simply hard to stomach.\n\nReading Reese\u2019s book, I found myself thinking of Matthew Scully\u2019s Dominion: The Power of Man, the Suffering of Animals, and the Call to Mercy, published in 2002. Like Reese, Scully describes the abuse of animals as a moral wrong, but unlike Reese, Scully\u2019s assessment is suffused with fellow-feeling. Scully comes to the issue as a Christian (though, by his own assessment, \u201cnot a particularly pious\u201d one) and as a conservative. And so it\u2019s surprising that his book also includes scathing critiques of capitalism throughout: \u201cMy copy of the Good Book doesn\u2019t say, \u2018Go forth to selleth every creature that moveth.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t say you can baiteth and slayeth and stuffeth every thing in sight, either, let alone deducteth the costs,\u201d he writes. He criticizes his fellow conservatives for their posture in animal-welfare conversations, for their \u201clazy disdain of moral inconveniences,\u201d and their belief \u201cthat somehow the free market will right all things and any cruelty will be redeemed by the miraculous workings of capitalism.\u201d And this from a man who worked as a speechwriter for George W. Bush.\n\nIt is something of this kind of fiery radicalism that I was hoping to find in Reese\u2019s book. His idea is radical. But The End of Animal Farming proceeds blandly through its points like a slide deck at a pitch meeting. Instead of critiquing the capitalist logic that gives us factory farming, Reese proposes replacing the meat business with another, more technically advanced model. And that\u2019s fine and sensible. But it seems unlikely that such a dispassionate approach will be enough to spark the major changes in eating habits and foodways that could bring about a slaughterless future. Reese\u2019s idea\u2014that people will give up something pleasurable and familiar without the spark of something deeply felt, be it shame or compassion\u2014relies on a very generous view of the human animal."

    "text": "The Other Two may be the first great comedy to focus on the thirtysomethings who feel sandwiched between existential ennui and otter memes.\n\nThe Other Two extends this joke format into an entire universe. It follows three siblings, two of whom are much older than the third (they are, as it turns out, \u201cold millennials,\u201d a distinction they clarify in the pilot episode). Brooke Dubek (the very funny Hel\u00e9ne Yorke, previously of High Maintenance) is a former aspiring ballerina in her thirties who aged out of a professional dance career into a permanent malaise; when we meet her, she is squatting in an empty model apartment in Manhattan inside a building where she works as a low-level real estate broker. She oversleeps, wakes up with her face in a slice of cold pizza, and tries to hide the evidence of her presence when another broker walks in and finds her trying to stuff the pizza box into a dryer. She is summarily fired, back on the hunt for work again. Her slightly younger brother, Cary (Drew Tarver), is an actor in New York who cannot seem to book a role. He keeps auditioning for lackluster parts like \u201cman who smells fart\u201d in commercials, and even then, he falls short and falls back into his restaurant job until the next opportunity comes along.\n\nBoth Cary and Brooke know they are running out of time to \u201cmake it\u201d\u2014even though motivational posters claim that success has no hard deadline, these characters are grounded enough to know that stardom does, and they are rapidly approaching it. They both pursued more traditional (and very \u201colder millennial\u201d) paths, while trying to break through: Brooke attended a competitive dance academy as a teen, while Cary moved from Ohio to the big city and started hoofing it to castings. They were both born just a little too late to become YouTube famous, or to pull the lucrative scam that is becoming a full-time Instagram influencer.\n\nTheir tween brother, Chase, on the other hand, rides these new modes of exposure to global fame without even trying. When the show begins, Brooke and Cary learn from their mother Pat (Molly Shannon, who, with her Kate Gosselin hairstyle, bedazzled tunics, and manic energy, fully looks the part of the upstart momager) that Chase (Case Walker) has gone viral. His saccharine, homespun video for a squeaky pop song called \u201cMarry U At Recess,\u201d is an Internet sensation, earning him an appearance on the Today Show and an immediate record deal. Chase, who with his Mouseketeer dimples and flat-brimmed caps is clearly a nod to a young Justin Bieber, is happy with the attention but more or less indifferent to fame. It is Pat who pushes him to professionalize, moving her 13-year-old son to Manhattan so that he will be closer to industry types. She hires a schmoozy manager named Streeter (Ken Marino) and a no-nonsense publicist (Wanda Sykes, who repeatedly steals scenes). With \u201cTeam Chase\u201d in place\u2014including a group of nameless pop hook writers who provide the singer with his next hit, \u201cStink\u201d about, well, dancing so hard you smell bad\u2014all the adults present strap in for the rocket ride that comes with latching oneself to a promising teenage talent.\n\nAnd then, there\u2019s the other two. What makes this show about a lonesome, lost generation is that Brooke and Cary don\u2019t immediately resent Chase\u2019s opportunities, even though their trajectories have been so rocky and uninspired. They are far too burnt out to feel ire, or even the desire to exploit their brother for their own gain. That kind of opportunistic leeching is reserved for the older characters, like Streeter and Pat, who see Chase as a kind of cash cow and golden ticket to their second act. Instead, Cary and Brooke seem mildly amused by the shift in their family dynamic, and see that in assisting Chase with his career, they might be able to regain some of the purpose that the world beat out of them. Brooke swallows her pride to become Chase\u2019s assistant, which at first feels menial to her but increasingly becomes a point of pride. She finds she is far more capable than she ever gave herself credit for: hauling a woozy, drunk Chase out of his nightclub birthday party (sponsored by Voss water) to safety; calming down a throng of screaming fangirls on the chartered flight where Chase launches his new album, making tough calls about Chase\u2019s costuming and set design.\n\nWhen Brooke boasts that the Internet is calling her a \u201cwhite feminist,\u201d she has to be told that this isn\u2019t a good thing.\n\nCary has a different journey, but it too is one of self-discovery. For most of his career, Cary has been denying who he really is, often denying or downplaying his identity as a gay man. He is in a confusing make-out relationship with his frat boy roommate (who insists that he is absolutely heterosexual), and he seems uncomfortable with being openly gay in auditions or on social media. When Chase publicly outs his brother with a single called \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Gay (And That\u2019s Ok),\u201d Cary starts to flail. In a fast-paced farcical sequence that would delight Noel Coward, Cary first demands that Chase\u2019s publicist remove the video, until he learns it is trending. Then there is backlash, and then backlash to the backlash. The Other Two is an extremely studied parody\u2014the years at SNL have honed Kelly and Schneider\u2019s scalpels\u2014and Cary\u2019s frenzied, flip-flopping reaction to his 15 minutes of Twitter fame is as accurate as it is outrageous. As a millennial just a bit too old to know how to react to online fame with any modicum of chill, he proceeds to lean too far into his notoriety, getting a Cheeto-orange spray tan and bleaching the tips of his hair."

    "text": "\u201cIt will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive,\u201d she said recently. \u201cThe green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they\u2019re for it right?\u201d\n\nThat quote led many to believe that Pelosi was dismissive of the Green New Deal and the activists who support it. The Rolling Stone interview suggests otherwise. \u201cI\u2019d probably be doing that myself,\u201d she told the magazine in reference to the recent protests of her led by the Sunrise Movement. Pelosi has applauded the climate group\u2019s efforts, leading Vox\u2019s David Roberts\u2014one of the media\u2019s most prominent voices for immediate, sweeping action on climate change\u2014to argue that \u201cshe and AOC are working together on this, not at odds.\u201d As Pelosi told Rolling Stone, \u201cI understand that to be an advocate you are persistent, dissatisfied and relentless. I\u2019ve been there. I understand it. You have that responsibility as an advocate.\u201d\n\nBut Pelosi also told Rolling Stone she has a \u201cdifferent responsibility as a leader\u201d\u2014not to shape public opinion, but to respond to it. \u201cYou have to make decisions that you\u2019re going to reach certain goals, and some of our goals we think are achievable,\u201d she said. Pelosi recognizes that she alone can\u2019t convince Democrats\u2014much less Republicans\u2014to support something their constituents don\u2019t want. And she can\u2019t put a Green New Deal to a vote knowing it will lose. \u201cThat\u2019s why public opinion is so important,\u201d she added. \u201cYoung people know better than people who serve here in Congress that [solving climate change] is important to do.\u201d She\u2019s essentially imploring climate activists to gather enough support for the Green New Deal to make it palatable to elected officials.\n\nThe Green New Deal is indeed unachievable at this moment. But the politics of an issue can change in a flash. It has taken Green New Deal activists mere months to transform the climate policy conversation in Washington. Pelosi sees that\u2014and wants them to keep it up. \u201cWe have to take it to the public, and I think it should be an important part of the presidential campaign,\u201d she told Rolling Stone. \u201cEverything that we\u2019re talking about has to be elevated to the presidential level.\u201d\n\nClimate activists have reason to remain wary of Pelosi. She calls global warming \u201cthe challenge of this generation,\u201d but doesn\u2019t appear to have a strong understanding of the Green New Deal and has expressed skepticism about its ambitious reach. She told Rolling Stone that the Green New Deal resolution \u201cgoes beyond what our charge is\u201d because it also proposes single-payer healthcare and a federal jobs guarantee. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of, like, a broader agenda,\u201d Pelosi said."

    "text": "Refusing the women\u2019s request for repatriation on the grounds that they present a threat involves similarly poor logic. We have no idea what threat if any, is posed by these former ISIS members, because proper assessment has not yet been carried out, and likely cannot be without repeated observation, interview, and so forth. Proper assessment itself demands that the women return. But supposing these women do present a risk, we cannot argue that domestic or regional security aims are better served by leaving them in a Syrian camp: As we now know, the Islamic State itself grew partly from the American policy of keeping large numbers of possible radicals in a detention camp in Iraq, where many Islamic State leaders likely met. Furthermore, if Muthana and Begum cannot stay in the camps indefinitely, which seems likely given Turkish plans for further actions against the Kurds in Syria, then the only option is for them to go to another country where they hold citizenship. Are war-torn Yemen or Bangladesh, both home to significant numbers of Islamic extremists, really better equipped to deal with Muthana and Begum than the U.K. or U.S.?\n\nSeeking to deprive people of citizenship simply because we can sets a risky precedent: a race to disown extremists or \u201cundesirable\u201d people whenever it is legally possible to do so. States will be able to rid themselves of responsibility for dealing with people deemed a problem in favor of simply deporting them\u2014an approach which, in an increasingly global age, seems neither moral nor strategic, from a security perspective.\n\nWhen men transgress we accept them back, confident that our judicial and particularly our penal systems are equipped to deal with male violence.\n\nMost importantly, we need to recognize how cases like these are gendered. As evidenced by the successful U.K. prosecution of Mohammed Uddin of terrorism-related offences, the prosecution of nine of twelve American returnees, and the upcoming trial against Ibraheem Musaibli, when men transgress we accept them back, confident that our judicial and particularly our penal systems are equipped to deal with male violence\u2014even their extreme violence. Women present a problem: It\u2019s hard to know what crimes if any they have committed beyond \u201cmembership of a proscribed organisation.\u201d Moreover, because they don\u2019t appear to have engaged in violence, we presume they can\u2019t really have been that committed to \u201cthe cause\u201d; there must be some other reason. Lawyers for Samantha Elhassani, the only American woman repatriated from Iraq so far and who now awaits trial for supporting ISIS, have played up \u201cvictim\u201d narratives, pointing to an abusive husband and saying she was \u201cduped\u201d into joining. European Women being tried in Iraq for supporting ISIS make similar claims, although the courts there are more skeptical of their arguments.\n\nMuthana and Begum do not claim to have been victims, but neither do they appear to have participated in violence. We don\u2019t know how to handle them. Going by outraged op-eds, these women particularly offend Western sensibilities by having preferred ISIS to the West, rejecting the idea that the West is good for all women and especially Muslim women. They are insufficiently grateful, refusing to be the \u201cgood victims\u201d we demand\u2014ones who can be saved. Such reactions have a distinct colonial feel to them. And the result, prosecuting male returnees while now refusing even to repatriate female ones, effectively gives women less of a path to atonement and redemption than their more clearly prosecutable male counterparts.\n\nIf governments reject these women\u2019s applications to return, they will be signaling that this action is essential for security whilst asserting that failed or poorly resourced states are better equipped to handle potential extremists. They will be establishing a precedent whereby states seek to disenfranchise those with dual citizenship whenever they are deemed problematic, creating buck-passing problems for international law and security. They will be undermining existing efforts to prevent and counter violent extremism. And they will be reinforcing colonial narratives and stereotyped gender assumptions which are actively damaging to efforts to prevent and counter violent extremism. Surely it would be better to treat these women like any other citizens who may have committed a crime: Take them back and let the justice system sort it out. Deeming extremist women uniquely impossible to repatriate\u2014or undeserving of repatriation\u2014helps no one."

    "text": "In July, Jeff Merkley, the junior senator from Oregon, traveled to Iowa. The trip was his third in twelve months\u2014a sign, political commentators said, that he was preparing to launch a presidential bid.\n\nNobody from the West Coast has ever won the Democratic presidential nomination. But two years from now, at least six will likely be competing for it: a mayor, a governor, at least two senators, even a few business executives. Tom Steyer, a venture capitalist from San Francisco, has already spent $40 million on a national ad campaign calling for President Trump\u2019s impeachment and has held town halls in Iowa and New Hampshire. Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington, headed to Iowa in June, where he gave the keynote speech at a Democratic Party function outside Des Moines. Eric Garcetti, the photogenic mayor of Los Angeles, was there just two months before. On a swing through the Northeast in May, Garcetti also stopped by New Hampshire. (Senator Kamala Harris of California and Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks, are widely seen as presidential contenders as well, though so far they have refrained from visiting the early primary states.) The flurry of trips is instructive. With Donald Trump in the White House, a group of gifted politicians and public figures from the Pacific Coast believe that they are the best positioned to challenge him.\n\nThey may be right. A special brand of American liberalism, at once independent-minded and dedicated to the common good, has flourished in the West. And it could well be this tradition\u2014with its commitment to immigrants, to equality, to free trade, and to environmentalism\u2014that provides the best path forward for Democrats looking to unite their fractured base.\n\nAmericans tend to think of the West Coast as a liberal fortress. But not so long ago, Washington, Oregon, and California supported Republicans. (Much of the rural parts of all three states still does.) Westerners were attracted to the GOP\u2019s valorization of individual independence, an attraction that sometimes manifested as libertarianism. They wanted to be allowed to do their own thing, without interference from the state. This emphasis on autonomy is still apparent. \u201cWe\u2019re the people who believe in personal freedom,\u201d Oregon Senator Ron Wyden told me."

    "text": "Over the years, Trump and his sons would try and fail five times to build a new Trump Tower in Moscow. But for Trump, what mattered most were the lucrative connections he had begun to make with the Kremlin\u2014and with the wealthy Russians who would buy so many of his properties in the years to come. \u201cRussians make up a pretty disproportionate cross section of a lot of our assets,\u201d Donald Trump Jr. boasted at a real estate conference in 2008. \u201cWe see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\u201d\n\nThe money, illicit and otherwise, began to rain in earnest after the Soviet Union fell in 1991. President Boris Yeltsin\u2019s shift to a market economy was so abrupt that cash-rich gangsters and corrupt government officials were able to privatize and loot state-held assets in oil, coal, minerals, and banking. Yeltsin himself, in fact, would later describe Russia as \u201cthe biggest mafia state in the world.\u201d After Vladimir Putin succeeded Yeltsin as president, Russian intelligence effectively joined forces with the country\u2019s mobsters and oligarchs, allowing them to operate freely as long as they strengthen Putin\u2019s power and serve his personal financial interests. According to James Henry, a former chief economist at McKinsey & Company who consulted on the Panama Papers, some $1.3 trillion in illicit capital has poured out of Russia since the 1990s.\n\nSemion Mogilevich.\n\nAt the top of the sprawling criminal enterprise was Semion Mogilevich. Beginning in the early 1980s, according to the FBI, the short, squat Ukrainian was the key money-laundering contact for the Solntsevskaya Bratva, or Brotherhood, one of the richest criminal syndicates in the world. Before long, he was running a multibillion-dollar worldwide racket of his own. Mogilevich wasn\u2019t feared because he was the most violent gangster, but because he was reputedly the smartest. The FBI has credited the \u201cbrainy don,\u201d who holds a degree in economics from Lviv University, with a staggering range of crimes. He ran drug trafficking and prostitution rings on an international scale; in one characteristic deal, he bought a bankrupt airline to ship heroin from Southeast Asia into Europe. He used a jewelry business in Moscow and Budapest as a front for art that Russian gangsters stole from museums, churches, and synagogues all over Europe. He has also been accused of selling some $20 million in stolen weapons, including ground-to-air missiles and armored troop carriers, to Iran. \u201cHe uses this wealth and power to not only further his criminal enterprises,\u201d the FBI says, \u201cbut to influence governments and their economies.\u201d\n\nIn Russia, Mogilevich\u2019s influence reportedly reaches all the way to the top. In 2005, Alexander Litvinenko, a Russian intelligence agent who defected to London, recorded an interview with investigators detailing his inside knowledge of the Kremlin\u2019s ties to organized crime. \u201cMogilevich,\u201d he said in broken English, \u201chave good relationship with Putin since 1994 or 1993.\u201d A year later Litvinenko was dead, apparently poisoned by agents of the Kremlin.\n\nVyachelsav Ivankov. Sergey Ponomarev/AP\n\nMogilevich\u2019s greatest talent, the one that places him at the top of the Russian mob, is finding creative ways to cleanse dirty cash. According to the FBI, he has laundered money through more than 100 front companies around the world, and held bank accounts in at least 27 countries. And in 1991, he made a move that led directly to Trump Tower. That year, the FBI says, Mogilevich paid a Russian judge to spring a fellow mob boss, Vyachelsav Kirillovich Ivankov, from a Siberian gulag. If Mogilevich was the brains, Ivankov was the enforcer\u2014a vor v zakone, or \u201cmade man,\u201d infamous for torturing his victims and boasting about the murders he had arranged. Sprung by Mogilevich, Ivankov made the most of his freedom. In 1992, a year after he was released from prison, he headed to New York on an illegal business visa and proceeded to set up shop in Brighton Beach.\n\nIn Red Mafiya, his book about the rise of the Russian mob in America, investigative reporter Robert I. Friedman documented how Ivankov organized a lurid and violent underworld of tattooed gangsters. When Ivankov touched down at JFK, Friedman reported, he was met by a fellow vor, who handed him a suitcase with $1.5 million in cash. Over the next three years, Ivankov oversaw the mob\u2019s growth from a local extortion racket to a multibillion-dollar criminal enterprise. According to the FBI, he recruited two \u201ccombat brigades\u201d of Special Forces veterans from the Soviet war in Afghanistan to run the mafia\u2019s protection racket and kill his enemies.\n\nLike Mogilevich, Ivankov had a lot of dirty money he needed to clean up. He bought a Rolls-Royce dealership that was used, according to The New York Times, \u201cas a front to launder criminal proceeds.\u201d The FBI concluded that one of Ivankov\u2019s partners in the operation was Felix Komarov, an upscale art dealer who lived in Trump Plaza on Third Avenue. Komarov, who was not charged in the case, called the allegations baseless. He acknowledged that he had frequent phone conversations with Ivankov, but insisted the exchanges were innocent. \u201cI had no reason not to call him,\u201d Komarov told a reporter.\n\nTrump Taj Mahal paid the largest fine ever levied against a casino for having \u201cwillfully violated\u201d anti-money-laundering rules.\n\nThe feds wanted to arrest Ivankov, but he kept vanishing. \u201cHe was like a ghost to the FBI,\u201d one agent recalls. Agents spotted him meeting with other Russian crime figures in Miami, Los Angeles, Boston, and Toronto. They also found he made frequent visits to Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, which mobsters routinely used to launder huge sums of money. In 2015, the Taj Mahal was fined $10 million\u2014the highest penalty ever levied by the feds against a casino\u2014and admitted to having \u201cwillfully violated\u201d anti-money-laundering regulations for years.\n\nThe FBI also struggled to figure out where Ivankov lived. \u201cWe were looking around, looking around, looking around,\u201d James Moody, chief of the bureau\u2019s organized crime section, told Friedman. \u201cWe had to go out and really beat the bushes. And then we found out that he was living in a luxury condo in Trump Tower.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Trump knew Ivankov personally, even if they were neighbors. But the fact that a top Russian mafia boss lived and worked in Trump\u2019s own building indicates just how much high-level Russian mobsters came to view the future president\u2019s properties as a home away from home. In 2009, after being extradited to Russia to face murder charges, Ivankov was gunned down in a sniper attack on the streets of Moscow. According to The Moscow Times, his funeral was a media spectacle in Russia, attracting \u201c1,000 people wearing black leather jackets, sunglasses, and gold chains,\u201d along with dozens of giant wreaths from the various brotherhoods.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, untold millions from the former Soviet Union flowed into Trump\u2019s luxury developments and Atlantic City casinos. But all the money wasn\u2019t enough to save Trump from his own failings as a businessman. He owed $4 billion to more than 70 banks, with a mind-boggling $800 million of it personally guaranteed. He spent much of the decade mired in litigation, filing for multiple bankruptcies and scrambling to survive. For most developers, the situation would have spelled financial ruin. But fortunately for Trump, his own economic crisis coincided with one in Russia.\n\nIn 1998, Russia defaulted on $40 billion in debt, causing the ruble to plummet and Russian banks to close. The ensuing financial panic sent the country\u2019s oligarchs and mobsters scrambling to find a safe place to put their money. That October, just two months after the Russian economy went into a tailspin, Trump broke ground on his biggest project yet. Rising to 72 stories in midtown Manhattan, Trump World Tower would be the tallest residential building on the planet. Construction got underway in 1999\u2014just as Trump was preparing his first run for the presidency on the Reform Party ticket\u2014 and concluded in 2001. As Bloomberg Businessweek reported earlier this year, it wasn\u2019t long before one-third of the units on the tower\u2019s priciest floors had been snatched up\u2014either by individual buyers from the former Soviet Union, or by limited liability companies connected to Russia. \u201cWe had big buyers from Russia and Ukraine and Kazakhstan,\u201d sales agent Debra Stotts told Bloomberg.\n\nSunny Isles, Florida, became known as \u201cLittle Moscow,\u201d thanks to Trump\u2019s high-rises. Rhona Wise/AFP/Getty\n\nAmong the new tenants was Eduard Nektalov, a diamond dealer from Uzbekistan. Nektalov, who was being investigated by a Treasury Department task force for mob-connected money laundering, bought a condo on the seventy-ninth floor, directly below Trump\u2019s future campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway. A month later he sold his unit for a $500,000 profit. The following year, after rumors circulated that Nektalov was cooperating with federal investigators, he was shot down on Sixth Avenue.\n\nTrump had found his market. After Trump World Tower opened, Sotheby\u2019s International Realty teamed up with a Russian real estate company to make a big sales push for the property in Russia. The \u201ctower full of oligarchs,\u201d as Bloomberg called it, became a model for Trump\u2019s projects going forward. All he needed to do, it seemed, was slap the Trump name on a big building, and high-dollar customers from Russia and the former Soviet republics were guaranteed to come rushing in. Dolly Lenz, a New York real estate broker, told USA Today that she sold some 65 units in Trump World Tower to Russians. \u201cI had contacts in Moscow looking to invest in the United States,\u201d Lenz said. \u201cThey all wanted to meet Donald.\u201d\n\nTo capitalize on his new business model, Trump struck a deal with a Florida developer to attach his name to six high-rises in Sunny Isles, just outside Miami. Without having to put up a dime of his own money, Trump would receive a cut of the profits. \u201cRussians love the Trump brand,\u201d Gil Dezer, the Sunny Isles developer, told Bloomberg. A local broker told The Washington Post that one-third of the 500 apartments he\u2019d sold went to \u201cRussian-speakers.\u201d So many bought the Trump-branded apartments, in fact, that the area became known as \u201cLittle Moscow.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussians love the Trump brand,\u201d said developer Gil Dezer, (left, with Trump). One Florida tenant, Anatoly Golubchik (right) was busted in a major money-laundering ring run out of Trump Tower. Billy Farrell/Patrick McMullan/Getty; John Marshall Mantel/ New York Times/Redux\n\nMany of the units were sold by a native of Uzbekistan who had immigrated from the Soviet Union in the 1980s; her business was so brisk that she soon began bringing Russian tour groups to Sunny Isles to view the properties. According to a Reuters investigation in March, at least 63 buyers with Russian addresses or passports spent $98 million on Trump\u2019s properties in south Florida. What\u2019s more, another one-third of the units\u2014more than 700 in all\u2014were bought by shadowy shell companies that concealed the true owners.\n\nTrump promoted and celebrated the properties. His organization continues to advertise the units; in 2011, when they first turned a profit, he attended a ceremonial mortgage-burning in Sunny Isles to toast their success. Last October, an investigation by the Miami Herald found that at least 13 buyers in the Florida complex have been the target of government investigations, either personally or through their companies, including \u201cmembers of a Russian-American organized crime group.\u201d Two buyers in Sunny Isles, Anatoly Golubchik and Michael Sall, were convicted for taking part in a massive international gambling and money-laundering syndicate that was run out of Trump Tower in New York. The ring, according to the FBI, was operating under the protection of the Russian mafia.\n\nThe influx of Russian money did more than save Trump\u2019s business from ruin\u2014it set the stage for the next phase of his career. By 2004, to the outside world, it appeared that Trump was back on top after his failures in Atlantic City. That January, flush with the appearance of success, Trump launched his newly burnished brand into another medium.\n\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d he declared in his opening narration for The Apprentice, \u201cthe largest real estate developer in New York. I own buildings all over the place. Model agencies. The Miss Universe pageant. Jetliners, golf courses, casinos, and private resorts like Mar-a-Lago, one of the most spectacular estates anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nBut it wouldn\u2019t be Trump without a better story than that. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t always so easy,\u201d he confessed, over images of him cruising around New York in a stretch limo. \u201cAbout 13 years ago, I was seriously in trouble. I was billions of dollars in debt. But I fought back, and I won. Big league. I used my brain. I used my negotiating skills. And I worked it all out. Now my company\u2019s bigger than it ever was and stronger than it ever was.\u2026 I\u2019ve mastered the art of the deal.\u201d\n\nThe show, which reportedly paid Trump up to $3 million per episode, instantly revived his career. \u201cThe Apprentice turned Trump from a blowhard Richie Rich who had just gone through his most difficult decade into an unlikely symbol of straight talk, an evangelist for the American gospel of success, a decider who insisted on standards in a country that had somehow slipped into handing out trophies for just showing up,\u201d journalists Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher observe in their book Trump Revealed. \u201cAbove all, Apprentice sold an image of the host-boss as supremely competent and confident, dispensing his authority and getting immediate results. The analogy to politics was palpable.\u201d\n\nRussians spent at least $98 million on Trump\u2019s properties in Florida\u2014and another third of the units were bought by shadowy shell companies.\n\nBut the story of Donald Trump, self-made business genius, left out any mention of the shady Russian investors who had done so much to make his comeback narrative possible. And Trump\u2019s business, despite the hype, was hardly \u201cstronger than it ever was\u201d\u2014his credit was still lousy, and two more of his prized properties in Atlantic City would soon fall into bankruptcy, even as his ratings soared.\n\nTo further enhance his brand, Trump used his prime-time perch to unveil another big project. On the 2006 season finale of The Apprentice, as 11 million viewers waited to learn which of the two finalists was going to be fired, Trump prolonged the suspense by cutting to a promotional video for his latest venture. \u201cLocated in the center of Manhattan\u2019s chic artist enclave, the Trump International Hotel and Tower in SoHo is the site of my latest development,\u201d he narrated over swooping helicopter footage of lower Manhattan. The new building, he added, would be nothing less than a \u201c$370 million work of art \u2026 an awe-inspiring masterpiece.\u201d\n\nTrump SoHo was the brainchild of two development companies\u2014Bayrock Group LLC and the Sapir Organization\u2014run by a pair of wealthy \u00e9migr\u00e9s from the former Soviet Union who had done business with some of Russia\u2019s richest and most notorious oligarchs. Together, their firms made Trump an offer he couldn\u2019t refuse: The developers would finance and build Trump SoHo themselves. In return for lending his name to the project, Trump would get 18 percent of the profits\u2014without putting up any of his own money.\n\nOne of the developers, Tamir Sapir, had followed an unlikely path to riches. After emigrating from the Soviet Union in the 1970s, he had started out driving a cab in New York City and ended up a billionaire living in Trump Tower. His big break came when he co-founded a company that sold high-tech electronics. According to the FBI, Sapir\u2019s partner in the firm was a \u201cmember or associate\u201d of Ivankov\u2019s mob in Brighton Beach. No charges were ever filed, and Sapir denied having any mob ties. \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he told The New York Times. \u201cEverything was done in the most legitimate way.\u201d\n\nTrump, who described Sapir as a \u201cgreat friend,\u201d bought 200 televisions from his electronics company. In 2007, he hosted the wedding of Sapir\u2019s daughter at Mar-a-Lago, and later attended her infant son\u2019s bris.\n\nIn 2007, Trump celebrated the launch of Trump SoHo with partners Tevfik Arif (center) and Felix Sater (right). Arif was later acquitted on charges of running a prostitution ring. Mark Von Holden/WireImage/Getty\n\nSapir also introduced Trump to Tevfik Arif, his partner in the Trump SoHo deal. On paper, at least, Arif was another heartwarming immigrant success story. He had graduated from the Moscow Institute of Trade and Economics and worked as a Soviet trade and commerce official for 17 years before moving to New York and founding Bayrock. Practically overnight, Arif became a wildly successful developer in Brooklyn. In 2002, after meeting Trump, he moved Bayrock\u2019s offices to Trump Tower, where he and his staff of Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s set up shop on the twenty-fourth floor.\n\nTrump worked closely with Bayrock on real estate ventures in Russia, Ukraine, and Poland. \u201cBayrock knew the investors,\u201d he later testified. Arif \u201cbrought the people up from Moscow to meet with me.\u201d He boasted about the deal he was getting: Arif was offering him a 20 to 25 percent cut on his overseas projects, he said, not to mention management fees. \u201cIt was almost like mass production of a car,\u201d Trump testified.\n\nBut Bayrock and its deals quickly became mired in controversy. Forbes and other publications reported that the company was financed by a notoriously corrupt group of oligarchs known as The Trio. In 2010, Arif was arrested by Turkish prosecutors and charged with setting up a prostitution ring after he was found aboard a boat\u2014chartered by one of The Trio\u2014with nine young women, two of whom were 16 years old. The women reportedly refused to talk, and Arif was acquitted. According to a lawsuit filed that same year by two former Bayrock executives, Arif started the firm \u201cbacked by oligarchs and money they stole from the Russian people.\u201d In addition, the suit alleges, Bayrock \u201cwas substantially and covertly mob-owned and operated.\u201d The company\u2019s real purpose, the executives claim, was to develop hugely expensive properties bearing the Trump brand\u2014and then use the projects to launder money and evade taxes.\n\nThe lawsuit, which is ongoing, does not claim that Trump was complicit in the alleged scam. Bayrock dismissed the allegations as \u201clegal conclusions to which no response is required.\u201d But last year, after examining title deeds, bank records, and court documents, the Financial Times concluded that Trump SoHo had \u201cmultiple ties to an alleged international money-laundering network.\u201d In one case, the paper reported, a former Kazakh energy minister is being sued in federal court for conspiring to \u201csystematically loot hundreds of millions of dollars of public assets\u201d and then purchasing three condos in Trump SoHo to launder his \u201cill-gotten funds.\u201d\n\nFelix Sater had a Trump business card long after his criminal past came to light.\n\nDuring his collaboration with Bayrock, Trump also became close to the man who ran the firm\u2019s daily operations\u2014a twice-convicted felon with family ties to Semion Mogilevich. In 1974, when he was eight years old, Felix Sater and his family emigrated from Moscow to Brighton Beach. According to the FBI, his father\u2014who was convicted for extorting local restaurants, grocery stores, and a medical clinic\u2014was a Mogilevich boss. Sater tried making it as a stockbroker, but his career came to an abrupt end in 1991, after he stabbed a Wall Street foe in the face with a broken margarita glass during a bar fight, opening wounds that required 110 stitches. (Years later, in a deposition, Trump downplayed the incident, insisting that Sater \u201cgot into a barroom fight, which a lot of people do.\u201d) Sater lost his trading license over the attack, and served a year in prison.\n\nIn 1998, Sater pleaded guilty to racketeering\u2014operating a \u201cpump and dump\u201d stock fraud in partnership with alleged Russian mobsters that bilked investors of at least $40 million. To avoid prison time, Sater turned informer. But according to the lawsuit against Bayrock, he also resumed \u201chis old tricks.\u201d By 2003, the suit alleges, Sater controlled the majority of Bayrock\u2019s shares\u2014and proceeded to use the firm to launder hundreds of millions of dollars, while skimming and extorting millions more. The suit also claims that Sater committed fraud by concealing his racketeering conviction from banks that invested hundreds of millions in Bayrock, and that he threatened \u201cto kill anyone at the firm he thought knew of the crimes committed there and might report it.\u201d In court, Bayrock has denied the allegations, which Sater\u2019s attorney characterizes as \u201cfalse, fabricated, and pure garbage.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Sater\u2019s account, in sworn testimony, he was very tight with Trump. He flew to Colorado with him, accompanied Donald Jr. and Ivanka on a trip to Moscow at Trump\u2019s invitation, and met with Trump\u2019s inner circle \u201cconstantly.\u201d In Trump Tower, he often dropped by Trump\u2019s office to pitch business ideas\u2014\u201cjust me and him.\u201d\n\nTrump seems unable to recall any of this. \u201cFelix Sater, boy, I have to even think about it,\u201d he told the Associated Press in 2015. Two years earlier, testifying in a video deposition, Trump took the same line. If Sater \u201cwere sitting in the room right now,\u201d he swore under oath, \u201cI really wouldn\u2019t know what he looked like.\u201d He added: \u201cI don\u2019t know him very well, but I don\u2019t think he was connected to the mafia.\u201d\n\nTrump and his lawyers say that he was unaware of Sater\u2019s criminal past when he signed on to do business with Bayrock. That\u2019s plausible, since Sater\u2019s plea deal in the stock fraud was kept secret because of his role as an informant. But even after The New York Times revealed Sater\u2019s criminal record in 2007, he continued to use office space provided by the Trump Organization. In 2010, he was even given an official Trump Organization business card that read: FELIX H. SATER, SENIOR ADVISOR TO DONALD TRUMP.\n\nIn 2013, police burst into Unit 63A of Trump Tower and rounded up 29 suspects in a $100 million money-laundering scheme.\n\nSater apparently remains close to Trump\u2019s inner circle. Earlier this year, one week before National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was fired for failing to report meetings with Russian officials, Trump\u2019s personal attorney reportedly hand-delivered to Flynn\u2019s office a \u201cback-channel plan\u201d for lifting sanctions on Russia. The co-author of the plan, according to the Times: Felix Sater.\n\nIn the end, Trump\u2019s deals with Bayrock, like so much of his business empire, proved to be more glitter than gold. The international projects in Russia and Poland never materialized. A Trump tower being built in Fort Lauderdale ran out of money before it was completed, leaving behind a massive concrete shell. Trump SoHo ultimately had to be foreclosed and resold. But his Russian investors had left Trump with a high-profile property he could leverage. The new owners contracted with Trump to run the tower; as of April, the president and his daughter Ivanka were still listed as managers of the property. In 2015, according to the federal financial disclosure reports, Trump made $3 million from Trump SoHo.\n\nIn April 2013, a little more than two years before Trump rode the escalator to the ground floor of Trump Tower to kick off his presidential campaign, police burst into Unit 63A of the high-rise and rounded up 29 suspects in two gambling rings. The operation, which prosecutors called \u201cthe world\u2019s largest sports book,\u201d was run out of condos in Trump Tower\u2014including the entire fifty-first floor of the building. In addition, unit 63A\u2014a condo directly below one owned by Trump\u2014served as the headquarters for a \u201csophisticated money-laundering scheme\u201d that moved an estimated $100 million out of the former Soviet Union, through shell companies in Cyprus, and into investments in the United States. The entire operation, prosecutors say, was working under the protection of Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov, whom the FBI identified as a top Russian vor closely allied with Semion Mogilevich. In a single two-month stretch, according to the federal indictment, the money launderers paid Tokhtakhounov $10 million.\n\nTokhtakhounov, who had been indicted a decade earlier for conspiring to fix the ice-skating competition at the 2002 Winter Olympics, was the only suspect to elude arrest. For the next seven months, the Russian crime boss fell off the radar of Interpol, which had issued a red alert. Then, in November 2013, he suddenly appeared live on international television\u2014sitting in the audience at the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow. Tokhtakhounov was in the VIP section, just a few seats away from the pageant owner, Donald Trump.\n\nAlimzhan Tokhtakhounov. Dmitry Korotayev/Epsilon/Getty\n\nAfter the pageant, Trump bragged about all the powerful Russians who had turned out that night, just to see him. \u201cAlmost all of the oligarchs were in the room,\u201d he told Real Estate Weekly. Contacted by Mother Jones, Tokhtakhounov insisted that he had bought his own ticket and was not a VIP. He also denied being a mobster, telling The New York Times that he had been indicted in the gambling ring because FBI agents \u201cmisinterpreted his Russian slang\u201d on their Trump Tower wiretaps, when he was merely placing $20,000 bets on soccer games.\n\nBoth the White House and the Trump Organization declined to respond to questions for this story. On the few occasions he has been questioned about his business entanglements with Russians, however, Trump has offered broad denials. \u201cI tweeted out that I have no dealings with Russia,\u201d he said at a press conference in January, when asked if Russia has any \u201cleverage\u201d over him, financial or otherwise. \u201cI have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we\u2019ve stayed away. And I have no loans with Russia. I have no loans with Russia at all.\u201d In May, when he was interviewed by NBC\u2019s Lester Holt, Trump seemed hard-pressed to think of a single connection he had with Russia. \u201cI have had dealings over the years where I sold a house to a very wealthy Russian many years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI had the Miss Universe pageant\u2014which I owned for quite a while\u2014I had it in Moscow a long time ago. But other than that, I have nothing to do with Russia.\u201d\n\nBut even if Trump has no memory of the many deals that he and his business made with Russian investors, he certainly did not \u201cstay away\u201d from Russia. For decades, he and his organization have aggressively promoted his business there, seeking to entice investors and buyers for some of his most high-profile developments. Whether Trump knew it or not, Russian mobsters and corrupt oligarchs used his properties not only to launder vast sums of money from extortion, drugs, gambling, and racketeering, but even as a base of operations for their criminal activities. In the process, they propped up Trump\u2019s business and enabled him to reinvent his image. Without the Russian mafia, it is fair to say, Donald Trump would not be president of the United States.\n\nSemion Mogilevich, the Russian mob\u2019s \u201cboss of bosses,\u201d also declined to respond to questions from the New Republic. \u201cMy ideas are not important to anybody,\u201d Mogilevich said in a statement provided by his attorney. \u201cWhatever I know, I am a private person.\u201d Mogilevich, the attorney added, \u201chas nothing to do with President Trump. He doesn\u2019t believe that anybody associated with him lives in Trump Tower. He has no ties to America or American citizens.\u201d\n\nBack in 1999, the year before Trump staged his first run for president, Mogilevich gave a rare interview to the BBC. Living up to his reputation for cleverness, the mafia boss mostly joked and double-spoke his way around his criminal activities. (Q: \u201cWhy did you set up companies in the Channel Islands?\u201d A: \u201cThe problem was that I didn\u2019t know any other islands. When they taught us geography at school, I was sick that day.\u201d) But when the exasperated interviewer asked, \u201cDo you believe there is any Russian organized crime?\u201d the \u201cbrainy don\u201d turned half-serious.\n\n\u201cHow can you say that there is a Russian mafia in America?\u201d he demanded. \u201cThe word mafia, as far as I understand the word, means a criminal group that is connected with the political organs, the police and the administration. I don\u2019t know of a single Russian in the U.S. Senate, a single Russian in the U.S. Congress, a single Russian in the U.S. government. Where are the connections with the Russians? How can there be a Russian mafia in America? Where are their connections?\u201d\n\nTwo decades later, we finally have an answer to Mogilevich\u2019s question."

    ],
    "text": "Thanks to Mueller\u2019s inquiry, D.C. is also confronting big changes to one of its sleaziest business models: lobbying for foreign governments. The indictment of Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, on charges of acting as an unregistered agent of Ukraine\u2014a crime that\u2019s almost as frequently neglected in federal law enforcement circles as lying to Congress\u2014sent K Street lobbyists scurrying to bring themselves into belated compliance with the law requiring agents of foreign governments to register with the Justice Department. Filings nearly tripled from 550 in 2016 to an estimated 1,302 today. This burst of transparency also revealed that foreign governments paid their U.S. agents nearly $850 million since 2017, according to the Open Secrets\u2019 Foreign Lobby Watch.\n\nMueller has helped reinvigorate the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), the 1938 law that seeks to inform the U.S. government and the American public of sources of foreign propaganda and influence. Between 1966 and 2015, only seven criminal cases were prosecuted under FARA, according to a report by the Department of Justice\u2019s inspector general. Just like the case of lying to Congress, the consequences of lax enforcement were predictable: The law was ignored. This normalization of foreign agent work has particular salience for both Mueller\u2019s probe and the republic at large, since by most working definitions, a spy is an unregistered foreign agent.\n\nManafort\u2019s attorneys argued Tuesday that Mueller is treating their client like a mob boss for the \u201cesoteric\u201d crime of failing to file a form, but it\u2019s no coincidence that Manafort\u2019s influence and wealth grew as FARA declined. The number of registered foreign agents peaked in the 1980s, when Manafort started his lobbying career. A little-noticed exhibit released by prosecutors this past weekend revealed that Manafort was already breaking the rules as early as 1986. That was when the Justice Department began investigating Manafort for FARA violations while he was working as a registered agent of Saudi Arabia and serving simultaneously as director of a federal agency, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. At the time, Manafort was pushing a massive Saudi arms sale.\n\nThe 1990s were good years for Manafort. His lucrative work for brutal dictators earned his firm a prominent spot in what the Center for Public Integrity called \u201cThe Torturer\u2019s Lobby.\u201d And this was when the FARA law withered into virtual irrelevance. The number of registered foreign agents dropped sharply in 1993, due in no small measure to the imposition of filing fees, according to the report from the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general. (The fee today is $305.) The work never stopped, of course; if anything, it grew. The only thing that stopped was the legally required disclosures. Prosecutors and FBI agents told the DOJ inspector general that the desire for secrecy came principally at the behest of the on-the-make lobbyist \u201cwho is conscious of the need to preserve credibility by concealing the support of the foreign principal.\u201d Only in Washington\u2019s through-the-looking-glass world could lying and breaking the law make you seem more credible.\n\nManafort\u2019s work in Ukraine from 2006 to 2015 showed how deep the rot had spread. His covert $11 million influence campaign on behalf of Ukraine\u2019s former President Viktor Yanukovych, a pro-Russian strongman, involved such D.C. notables as Tony Podesta, whose brother John ran Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign; Vin Weber, a former Republican congressman from Minnesota; and Gregory B. Craig, a White House counsel under President Obama who resigned from his partnership at the powerhouse law firm Skadden Arps. All are now reportedly the subject of criminal referrals from Mueller\u2019s team. The first witness called at Manafort\u2019s trial was Tad Devine, who worked for Manafort in Ukraine before he was chief strategist for Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign."

    "text": "The Other Two may be the first great comedy to focus on the thirtysomethings who feel sandwiched between existential ennui and otter memes.\n\nThe Other Two extends this joke format into an entire universe. It follows three siblings, two of whom are much older than the third (they are, as it turns out, \u201cold millennials,\u201d a distinction they clarify in the pilot episode). Brooke Dubek (the very funny Hel\u00e9ne Yorke, previously of High Maintenance) is a former aspiring ballerina in her thirties who aged out of a professional dance career into a permanent malaise; when we meet her, she is squatting in an empty model apartment in Manhattan inside a building where she works as a low-level real estate broker. She oversleeps, wakes up with her face in a slice of cold pizza, and tries to hide the evidence of her presence when another broker walks in and finds her trying to stuff the pizza box into a dryer. She is summarily fired, back on the hunt for work again. Her slightly younger brother, Cary (Drew Tarver), is an actor in New York who cannot seem to book a role. He keeps auditioning for lackluster parts like \u201cman who smells fart\u201d in commercials, and even then, he falls short and falls back into his restaurant job until the next opportunity comes along.\n\nBoth Cary and Brooke know they are running out of time to \u201cmake it\u201d\u2014even though motivational posters claim that success has no hard deadline, these characters are grounded enough to know that stardom does, and they are rapidly approaching it. They both pursued more traditional (and very \u201colder millennial\u201d) paths, while trying to break through: Brooke attended a competitive dance academy as a teen, while Cary moved from Ohio to the big city and started hoofing it to castings. They were both born just a little too late to become YouTube famous, or to pull the lucrative scam that is becoming a full-time Instagram influencer.\n\nTheir tween brother, Chase, on the other hand, rides these new modes of exposure to global fame without even trying. When the show begins, Brooke and Cary learn from their mother Pat (Molly Shannon, who, with her Kate Gosselin hairstyle, bedazzled tunics, and manic energy, fully looks the part of the upstart momager) that Chase (Case Walker) has gone viral. His saccharine, homespun video for a squeaky pop song called \u201cMarry U At Recess,\u201d is an Internet sensation, earning him an appearance on the Today Show and an immediate record deal. Chase, who with his Mouseketeer dimples and flat-brimmed caps is clearly a nod to a young Justin Bieber, is happy with the attention but more or less indifferent to fame. It is Pat who pushes him to professionalize, moving her 13-year-old son to Manhattan so that he will be closer to industry types. She hires a schmoozy manager named Streeter (Ken Marino) and a no-nonsense publicist (Wanda Sykes, who repeatedly steals scenes). With \u201cTeam Chase\u201d in place\u2014including a group of nameless pop hook writers who provide the singer with his next hit, \u201cStink\u201d about, well, dancing so hard you smell bad\u2014all the adults present strap in for the rocket ride that comes with latching oneself to a promising teenage talent.\n\nAnd then, there\u2019s the other two. What makes this show about a lonesome, lost generation is that Brooke and Cary don\u2019t immediately resent Chase\u2019s opportunities, even though their trajectories have been so rocky and uninspired. They are far too burnt out to feel ire, or even the desire to exploit their brother for their own gain. That kind of opportunistic leeching is reserved for the older characters, like Streeter and Pat, who see Chase as a kind of cash cow and golden ticket to their second act. Instead, Cary and Brooke seem mildly amused by the shift in their family dynamic, and see that in assisting Chase with his career, they might be able to regain some of the purpose that the world beat out of them. Brooke swallows her pride to become Chase\u2019s assistant, which at first feels menial to her but increasingly becomes a point of pride. She finds she is far more capable than she ever gave herself credit for: hauling a woozy, drunk Chase out of his nightclub birthday party (sponsored by Voss water) to safety; calming down a throng of screaming fangirls on the chartered flight where Chase launches his new album, making tough calls about Chase\u2019s costuming and set design.\n\nWhen Brooke boasts that the Internet is calling her a \u201cwhite feminist,\u201d she has to be told that this isn\u2019t a good thing.\n\nCary has a different journey, but it too is one of self-discovery. For most of his career, Cary has been denying who he really is, often denying or downplaying his identity as a gay man. He is in a confusing make-out relationship with his frat boy roommate (who insists that he is absolutely heterosexual), and he seems uncomfortable with being openly gay in auditions or on social media. When Chase publicly outs his brother with a single called \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Gay (And That\u2019s Ok),\u201d Cary starts to flail. In a fast-paced farcical sequence that would delight Noel Coward, Cary first demands that Chase\u2019s publicist remove the video, until he learns it is trending. Then there is backlash, and then backlash to the backlash. The Other Two is an extremely studied parody\u2014the years at SNL have honed Kelly and Schneider\u2019s scalpels\u2014and Cary\u2019s frenzied, flip-flopping reaction to his 15 minutes of Twitter fame is as accurate as it is outrageous. As a millennial just a bit too old to know how to react to online fame with any modicum of chill, he proceeds to lean too far into his notoriety, getting a Cheeto-orange spray tan and bleaching the tips of his hair."

    "text": "The women viewed the GABI program differently, however. At the center in St. George, they felt respected, even loved. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking of ACS,\u201d said one mother, \u201cbut then you think, \u2018No, I\u2019m going to the GABI program. It\u2019s completely different.\u2019\u201d The GABI initiative, along with several other pilot programs in New York, are part of a major effort by ACS to counteract its image as a \u201cbaby-snatching\u201d police force riddled with the same racial and economic biases that beset actual law enforcement in the United States. Together, the programs amount to an experiment: to see whether one of the largest child welfare agencies in the country can change the dynamics that have poisoned its relationship with the vulnerable families it seeks to serve and must oversee. It\u2019s a sort of idealistic gamble, deeply informed by critics who charge that child welfare agencies like ACS unfairly target the poor and the nonwhite, and treat all family crises with the hammer of child removal.\n\n\u201cIt used to be in the Bronx projects that all you had to do was shout, \u2018There\u2019s a cop in the hall,\u2019 and people would flee,\u201d said Martin Guggenheim, a law professor at NYU and a national expert on child welfare. \u201cNow you say, \u2018ACS is on the ground,\u2019 and people flee. That\u2019s one of the saddest parts: This is a helping agency, meant to support poor families, and the parents are terrified of the very agency whose charge is to support them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was so scared,\u201d one woman said, describing her terror when ACS banged on her door in the middle of the night. \u201cI thought they were going to take my kids.\u201d\n\nChanging the way a massive bureaucracy has done business for decades is no small task. Success relies not simply on new, more benevolent programs like GABI, but also on convincing ACS\u2019s community partners\u2014the private groups contracted to provide foster care and preventive services\u2014to embrace a new mission. It means convincing the holders of city and state purse strings\u2014the ACS budget is $2.7 billion for 2019\u2014to invest in experimental programs whose success won\u2019t be calculable for years, and whose failures will be splashed across the media, potentially costing government officials their jobs. Above all, it entails convincing families who, for generations, have viewed ACS as a threat, to give it another chance.\n\nIf successful, though, ACS could create a more benevolent model for child welfare that would be followed in other cities and states. ACS, which conducts more than 60,000 investigations of families each year, is one of the largest child welfare agencies in the country\u2014dwarfing many other states\u2019 agencies entirely. Its size alone guarantees that whatever happens here becomes a national model. \u201cEveryone in child welfare agrees that what\u2019s going on in New York City is relevant to the work happening elsewhere in the country,\u201d said Guggenheim. Instead of a government bureaucracy that is widely perceived as punitive and biased against the poor, ACS could transform itself into the type of agency that it wants to be: a resource families can turn to in times of trouble.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something to be said for why ACS partnered with us,\u201d Murphy said to the mothers at the St. George GABI center. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to operate out of fear, and they really want to be here to support people.\u201d The women nodded, considering the idea. Finally, one of them spoke, \u201cSo you\u2019re saying they want to change?\u201d\n\nIn January, Jennifer McClure photographed families at the GABI center in Staten Island. She then gave the parents and children art materials and invited them to draw on and decorate the images.\n\nFor more than 150 years, child welfare policies have swung back and forth between two polarized notions of how best to serve vulnerable children: Should they be removed from troubled homes, or should their families be helped? Should \u201cchild protection\u201d be the guiding principle, or \u201cfamily preservation\u201d? Where society lands on these issues has always depended on prevailing attitudes toward poverty. Reformers have long argued that taking children from poor families does nothing to address the root problem of poverty. In June, for example, Democratic Representative Gwen Moore of Wisconsin, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus who, as an 18-year-old college student, was temporarily forced to relinquish her own child to relative foster care, introduced the Family Poverty Is Not Neglect Act, which stipulates that children can\u2019t be removed from families solely on the basis of poverty-related issues. \u201cI went through the system, and was humiliated, and mistreated,\u201d Moore said in a 2017 interview. \u201cI see that there is a deliberate effort to destroy these families.\u201d Moreover, children who are placed in chronically overtaxed foster care programs experience long-lasting trauma and, as studies have shown, far higher risk of teen pregnancy, incarceration, unemployment, and homelessness, compared to children who are left in families with similar problems. Conservative critics, however, have essentially argued\u2014particularly during America\u2019s periodic drives to crack down on welfare\u2014that parents who can\u2019t support their families are, by definition, unfit.\n\nFor decades, child welfare policies have swung between two competing notions: Should kids be removed from troubled homes, or should their families be helped?\n\nFrom the mid-1800s through 1929, New York City and other Eastern cities arrived at a draconian solution, shipping as many as 250,000 children from impoverished tenement families West to the expanding U.S. frontier. Children placed on \u201corphan trains\u201d were offered for adoption at depot stops and churches along the way. (To modern eyes, many of those adoptions more closely resembled indentured servitude.) Then, in the 1910s, the pendulum swung the other way, as a movement arose to supply pensions to \u201cdeserving\u201d single mothers, particularly widows, so they could safely raise their children at home. (What minimal help that was offered, though, was restricted almost entirely to white mothers, as were the New Deal\u2019s welfare provisions two decades later.)\n\nIn the 1960s, things changed again, when the concept of child abuse was \u201crediscovered\u201d by a group of doctors that included C. Henry Kempe, a pediatrician who coined the term \u201cbattered child syndrome.\u201d Kempe\u2019s label\u2014which he described as deliberately \u201cprovocative and anger-producing\u201d\u2014helped lead to the establishment of mandatory child abuse reporting laws across the country. The idea was widely embraced, notes journalist Nina Bernstein in The Lost Children of Wilder, her account of the legal battle to reform New York City foster care, because casting child abuse as a \u201cclassless\u201d phenomenon\u2014no more endemic to the poor than the rich\u2014allowed politicians to isolate child welfare spending from the larger anti-poverty programs of the Great Society, which were by then already losing support.\n\nBut the focus on child abuse, which might seem a positive, child-oriented development, resulted in demonizing parents\u2014most often parents of color\u2014whose children suffered because of the environments they were born into. \u201cWhat was understood by some advocates as a social problem rooted in poverty and other social inequalities became widely interpreted as a symptom of individual parents\u2019 mental depravity,\u201d notes social critic Dorothy Roberts in her book Shattered Bonds: The Color of Child Welfare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been a classless problem, and it certainly is not today,\u201d said Gottlieb. \u201cIf legislators say, \u2018We\u2019re going to pour these billions into supporting poor families,\u2019 it won\u2019t go anywhere. If we say, \u2018We\u2019re going to protect children from abusive parents\u2019\u2014if we label a demon\u2014then the money can follow that.\u201d In the child welfare system today, she said, \u201ceverything we do for families is set up around the idea that \u2018We have to protect our children from you.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the 1970s, the class-action lawsuit Wilder v. Bernstein took aim at racial discrimination within the private agencies that handled New York City\u2019s foster care with taxpayer support, but which systematically excluded black children. Black children at the time were relegated to harsh, decrepit juvenile reformatories, in which, in some cases, more than 80 percent of the kids hadn\u2019t committed crimes but were simply would-be foster children. The racial disparity was so stark, Nina Bernstein notes, that the superintendent of one facility called it \u201ca plantation.\u201d By the time Wilder was settled in 1986, almost 15 years after it began, the city\u2019s foster care system was starting to explode amid the aids and crack epidemics. By the early 1990s, there were nearly 50,000 children in the system\u2014almost all of whom were black.\n\nPolitics at the national level only made matters worse, as the political establishment turned against welfare and began to argue explicitly that parents who needed support to raise their children had no business keeping them. In 1994, Newt Gingrich put it most bluntly: \u201cWe\u2019ll help you with foster care, we\u2019ll help you with orphanages, we\u2019ll help you with adoption\u201d\u2014but not, as Bernstein noted, with money for family preservation, a position that was echoed in the Contract With America that Gingrich proposed later that year. By 1997, when Congress passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act, establishing a tight timetable for terminating parental rights and offering foster children for adoption, the campaign against keeping families together had become so forceful that one magazine headline read, \u201cfamily preservation\u2014it can kill.\u201d\n\nThe force of the pendulum swing between child protection and family preservation is often driven by high-profile tragedies. In New York in 1995, Elisa Izquierdo, a six-year-old girl from Brooklyn, was brutally beaten to death by her mother after repeated reports of abuse from neighbors and Izquierdo\u2019s school went unheeded by the city\u2019s Child Welfare Administration and other city and state agencies. The case became a national scandal. Time magazine published a haunting photo of the girl on its cover, under the title, \u201ca shameful death: let down by the system, murdered by her mom, a little girl symbolizes america\u2019s failure to protect its children.\u201d The Child Welfare Administration was abolished, and ACS was created in its stead.\n\nIzquierdo\u2019s death sparked what has become a familiar pattern of overcorrection, common in the aftermath of such tragedies, in which child welfare officials ramp up family separations, in an effort to avoid another catastrophic \u201cmiss.\u201d Through the mid-\u201990s, notes a recent report by the Center for New York City Affairs, a policy research institute at the New School, the ACS caseworkers\u2019 union even counseled its members with the grim slogan, \u201cWhen in doubt, pull \u2019em out.\u201d And they did: In the three years following Izquierdo\u2019s death, the number of children taken into ACS custody increased by 50 percent.\n\nFamily preservation advocates like the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform call this a \u201cfoster care panic.\u201d It is hardly unique to New York. In the two years following the 1993 murder of a toddler in Illinois, the state\u2019s foster care system grew by 44 percent, rendering Illinois children more likely to end up in state custody than anywhere else in the United States.\n\nBut the need to intervene more is the wrong lesson to take from tragedy. \u201cChildren fall through the cracks not because child welfare agencies are devoting too much to family preservation,\u201d Dorothy Roberts writes, but \u201cbecause agencies are devoting too much to child removal.\u201d When there are too many children in foster care, she argues, there are neither enough foster homes to care for them, nor enough caseworkers with adequate time to identify those children who are truly at risk. Indeed, NCCPR notes, three years after the foster care panic began in Illinois, child deaths in the state had increased by 17 percent. Moreover, the focus on child protection creates perverse incentives for caseworkers and welfare agencies. \u201cThere has never been a preventive services worker in the history of child welfare who has ever been penalized for not helping a family enough,\u201d said Gottlieb. \u201cBut they are penalized all the time for not doing enough to protect the kid.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, a similar panic flared again, following the deaths in New York of two children whom ACS had left in their homes. That September, a six-year-old boy from Harlem named Zymere Perkins was allegedly beaten to death by his mother\u2019s boyfriend just weeks after an ACS caseworker closed his case. Two months later, three-year-old Jaden Jordan of Gravesend, Brooklyn, died. ACS had received an anonymous report that the boy was being kept in a dog crate, but for two days, caseworkers couldn\u2019t locate him, because they had been given the wrong address, and staff didn\u2019t know how to find the correct one in their system. Like Perkins, Jordan was allegedly beaten to death by his mother\u2019s boyfriend.\n\nThe ensuing public outcry was tremendous. \u201cHow ACS Failed Him,\u201d read the headline of a New York Post article detailing the abuse Perkins suffered. The city\u2019s other tabloid, the Daily News, lambasted Perkins\u2019s caseworker with a cover story that declared, \u201cshe let him die to get promoted.\u201d Then\u2013ACS Commissioner Gladys Carri\u00f3n, a reformer who had focused on preventive services intended to keep children out of foster care, resigned under pressure.\n\nSince then, ACS has been eager to repair its image. In June, it launched a public relations campaign featuring videos and subway ads with children and parents who\u2019d been involved with the system declaring, \u201cACS fought for my family.\u201d In June, the agency unveiled a \u201cCPS appreciation week,\u201d to honor New York City\u2019s child protective specialists, its \u201cfirst responders\u201d for children. And its new commissioner, David Hansell, who succeeded Carri\u00f3n in February 2017, has been courting the media in an effort to improve public perception of the agency.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of terrible tragedies,\u201d Hansell told me, \u201cand the dynamic we\u2019ve seen over and over again\u2014not just in New York City but across the country\u2014is that a terrible tragedy happens, it gets a lot of attention in the public, there are investigations, and so on. It leads the child welfare agency to be reactive and defensive and to be more draconian.\u201d He vowed to address this cycle by focusing on the root causes that underlie tragedies like child deaths, rather than seeking individuals or communities to blame.\n\nYet from 2016 to 2017, the number of children placed in foster care in the city increased 13 percent. Hansell attributed the increase not to caseworker reactiveness but to a rise in public reporting\u2014up 7 percent since 2016. However, in the year and a half following Perkins\u2019s death, ACS has also presided over a 54 percent increase in the number of cases it brought to family court, and a roughly 30 percent increase in emergency removals\u2014when ACS takes a child from parents before even seeing a judge. As a result, warned a July report from the Center for New York City Affairs, ACS staff caseloads have increased, families have been put on months-long waiting lists to receive preventive services, and family courts have been so swamped with cases that attorneys say it\u2019s led to \u201ca new level of dysfunction,\u201d with delays and deferrals \u201cthat impact every family in the system.\u201d\n\nI got a sense of this when I visited the Bronx Family Court, an imposing brutalist structure not far from Yankee Stadium. In June, in a windowless waiting room on the seventh floor, I watched a distraught young mother\u2014African American, like almost everyone else there\u2014approach the court clerk and two white lawyers who were complaining about the bad courthouse Wi-Fi and their children\u2019s college grades.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, what\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked. Her court- appointed attorney had left New York without anyone telling her, and her new lawyer hadn\u2019t shown up. \u201cI come every time [ACS] sets court appointments, and they never show,\u201d she said. The clerk apologized, then looked to one of the attorneys, who was there representing ACS: Maybe he should talk to the agency about why the mother\u2019s caseworker hadn\u2019t been in touch. The mother walked back to a wooden bench, where a young boy and an adult man waited silently. \u201cThis happens every day,\u201d she said, angry to the point of tears.\n\nInside one of the courtrooms, another African American woman, middle-aged, with braids pulled into a side bun, sat at the center of a U-shaped table, listening as her public defender explained that she\u2019d been accepted to an in-patient substance abuse program that allows parents to keep their children with them. A court-appointed guardian, there to represent the woman\u2019s young daughter, objected, saying it was too soon to place the child back in the mother\u2019s custody, and that the city should wait to see if she could stay sober. An ACS attorney concurred, arguing that the mother should only be allowed to see her daughter before entering rehab if she passed a drug test that day. The judge agreed to both requests, then asked the lawyers about their vacation plans before setting a date to reconvene in a month. The mother, whom no one had addressed directly, started to cry.\n\n"

    "text": "While soothing an ailing psyche with retail\u2014perhaps in lieu, or circumvention, of a profoundly dysfunctional health care system\u2014is quintessentially American, the consequences of our national anxiety don\u2019t stop at our wallets. In recent years our politics has become a politics of primal fear.\n\nIncendiary rhetoric promulgated by Fox News would have you believe that a human wave is washing up at our southern border in incomprehensible numbers, bringing disease and murder in its wake.\n\nFor more than a month, the functions of government ground to a partial halt over construction of a wall between the United States and its southern neighbors. The premise of the shutdown\u2014and the promise of the wall\u2014was that the United States was under imminent threat from migrants proceeding northward. Incendiary rhetoric promulgated by Fox News, its chief devotee the president, and sundry members of the Republican Party would have you believe that a human wave is washing up at our southern border in incomprehensible numbers, bringing disease and murder in its wake.\n\n\n\nThe midterm elections turned into a bitter contest over the threat represented by a column of migrants wending their way slowly northward. When some arrived at the border, they were tear-gassed en masse by a Border Patrol whose reinforcements included a deployment of thousands of U.S. soldiers, the largest deployment of troops during peacetime in a century. The much-vaunted wall, we are told, would keep these criminal disease-bearers away from American citizens. The wall was always central to the promise of the Trump presidency\u2014the idea that Mexicans are \u201cbringing crime\u201d was the premise of his campaign announcement in 2015\u2014and after two years of being stymied by Congress he has now declared a national emergency to build the wall unilaterally.\n\nAs inhabitants of a ludicrously well-defended empire, one that gobbles billions yearly for its stratospheric defense budgets, it\u2019s preposterous to imagine that dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of economic or situational migrants would pose a serious threat. Yet through the distorted lens of anxiety, where a single missed breath can feel like the onset of suffocation, even the smallest breach may seem catastrophic. So we imagine a communal bell jar, enclosing us all, an impenetrable but transparent border sealed off from the menace of human ruin.\n\nAnxiety disorder tends to fixate on specific objects: a shadow in a room; a loud noise in the street; the memory of a strained social interaction; the prospect of going outside. The migrant caravan was undoubtedly such a fixation, a specter from the south; the wall, its counterpart, a panacea better than a Xanax, a cure-all for the nation\u2019s many ills. The politics of stoking fear, then suggesting a militarized solution, isn\u2019t new, but it is playing out in its most lurid forms these days. If George W. Bush exploited post-9/11 fears about terrorism and WMDs to invade Iraq, Trump has conjured a threat out of a ragged group of some of the world\u2019s most desperate people. The state of the union, it seems, is scared as hell.\n\nBut not all fear is the distorted, excessive fear of anxiety disorder, beavering away over negligible or imagined ills. Some is the entirely justified fear of what is fearsome: struggle, deprivation, dying. In the APA study, people of color reported significantly higher anxiety than Caucasians, in an environment of rising, strident racism. Following an extended fight in the states and in Congress over America\u2019s tattered safety net, adults without health insurance reported a significantly higher overall stress level than those with insurance. The single largest area of increase in anxiety surrounded questions related to finances\u2014the fear of a bank balance driven into the red due to an illness or a layoff.\n\nAny attempt to rescue America from its deep-worn rut of fear must involve an attempt to address the conditions that give rise to that terror.\n\nGeneralized anxiety disorder, per the DSM-5, has a maddeningly self-contradictory list of symptoms: It gives rise to both restlessness and fatigue; both lapsed concentration and profound tension of the muscles. In this conflicted state, the mind and body team up to deprive the sufferer of sleep, and to induce irritability. Our body politic seems to suffer from a similar ailment: crouched defensively against threats real and imagined, yet unfocused by the endless distractions of the news cycle. We\u2019re restless for the next big story and fatigued of it already when it arrives. Sleepless and enraged, we pace through our days under the choleric guidance of a president whose only two emotions seem to be smugness and wrath.\n\nEight years after my initial diagnosis with a panic disorder, I have made a kind of fitful progress towards peace, managing my condition, more or less, with medication and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Lately, I have been working on mindfulness: the separation of troubled thoughts from self, the gathering of breath, the practicing of exercises meant to induce tranquility. It\u2019s slow, difficult work, shot through with setbacks, like a recent evening in which I became so convinced I would choke on a plate of dumplings that I threw them violently away from me, spilling ponzu sauce all over the floor. I wasn\u2019t killed by dumplings, and I quickly cleaned up the dark, sticky patch on my floor. I took a few deep breaths, and resolved to continue the work of trying to fix my broken psyche, piece by piece\u2014causes uncovered, wounds dressed, breathing ragged, then rhythmic.\n\nEmerging from the ludicrous and fearful dream of this era will be a long and painful process. Doing so won\u2019t be merely a matter of finding the right drug (or wall, or candidate, or party doctrine) to slow the nation\u2019s pulse. It\u2019s clear that comforting a troubled populace involves more than offering soothing words, or still worse, provocative, terror-fueled solutions to falsely magnified problems. Any attempt to rescue America from its deep-worn rut of fear must involve an attempt to address the conditions that give rise to that terror. The slow, unglamorous work of unknotting ourselves from fear is something we all have to work towards: through electoral politics, of course, and involvement in the great civic project of this nation.\n\nBut the anxious body is one prone to excess, spilling adrenaline thoughtlessly into overburdened veins. Fear is our ailment\u2014the grinding, weary work of insecurity, the grim, false fears of a racial invasion. Overcoming fear will require more than good policies and projects. It will require a new understanding of ourselves and our country, a kind of mindfulness about who we are, really, now that the swagger has gone. It will require addressing this nation\u2019s pathologies at the root: its failures, its crimes, its self-defeating myths. And it will require a measure of courage to break the heavy glass that seals us in, and breathe deeply in a cool new wind."

      "Matt Ford"
    ],
    "text": "While the two sides differ on how they interpret the Establishment Clause, the greater gulf is in how they interpret American history. To the American Legion, the Bladensburg cross only reflects a community\u2019s patriotic desire to commemorate its war dead. Any religious symbolism, they argue, is secondary to its secular purpose of honoring American soldiers. \u201cThe builders\u2019 decision to create a cross-shaped memorial reflects the fact that, during WWI, crosses became a well-recognized symbol of the losses of the war,\u201d the group explains.\n\nThe AHA disputed the suggestion that Christianity could represent all those who died in the conflict. \u201cWhen the government prominently displays a large Latin cross as a war memorial, it does more than just align the state with Christianity; it also callously discriminates against patriotic soldiers who are not Christian,\u201d they told the court. Transmuting the cross into a symbol of world war also did not go unchallenged. \u201cThat distortion should be rejected, not only because it amounts to legal chicanery, but also because it works the very kind of harm to religion that motivated the Establishment Clause\u2019s passage,\u201d the group argued.\n\nTo refute the cross\u2019s supposedly ecumenical appeal, they also drew upon darker aspects of the state\u2019s history. In the 1920s, Maryland law made it illegal \u201cto blaspheme or curse God or write or utter profane words about our Saviour Jesus Christ or of and concerning the Trinity or any of the persons thereof,\u201d the AHA told the court. The state also imposed a religious test to exclude atheists from public office until 1961. Nearby towns used restrictive covenants to keep prospective Jewish homeowners out of their communities at the time. The group pointed to local reports that the Ku Klux Klan marched in 1925 from \u201cthe peace cross at Bladensburg to the fiery cross at Lanham,\u201d and claimed that Klansmen were also often members of American Legion chapters at the time. \u201cDo we really want to settle on a test that fails to consider the values that our nation has developed since that era?\u201d the AHA asked the court.\n\n\u201cThese claims are as ludicrous as they are revolting,\u201d the American Legion shot back in its reply brief. The veterans\u2019 organization pointed to testimony from the AHA\u2019s own expert that the Legion was a \u201cremarkably diverse and ecumenical organization\u201d in the 1920s, with thousands of Catholic and Jewish members. Among them, the Legion said, was J. Moses Edlavitch, a Jewish veteran who ranked among the local chapter\u2019s leaders and signed the deed for the land upon which the monument was eventually built.\n\nThough the American Legion and the commission stressed the cross\u2019s non-sectarian nature, other supporters of the Bladensburg cross warned that its removal would threaten other Christian symbols in American civic life. The Thomas More Law Center, in its own friend-of-the-court brief, argued that the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision itself \u201cdemonstrates a hostility towards religion\u201d that the First Amendment prohibits. The conservative legal organization then denigrated the beliefs of those challenging the cross\u2019s placement. \u201cAllowing a historic war memorial to be destroyed to quell some momentary discomfort plaintiffs feel when they drive past the Bladensburg monument would do real and lasting harm to this country,\u201d the group told the court.\n\nSome of the monument\u2019s other supporters went even further. The Foundation for Moral Law, a legal advocacy group founded by former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, filed a friend-of-the-court brief noting that the National Mall in Washington, D.C. also resembles a crucifix. \u201cIf Congress can expressly reference the Latin cross as the basis for the plan for the National Mall, the City of Bladensburg can erect a Latin cross as a memorial to American veterans,\u201d the group told the court. \u201cOr must we now plow under the National Mall?\u201d\n\nThe Fourth Circuit dispensed with slippery-slope arguments in its ruling last year when the American Legion and the commission both warned that monuments at Arlington National Cemetery would be imperiled if they lost. \u201cThe crosses there are much smaller than the 40\u2013foot tall monolith at issue here,\u201d Thacker noted. \u201cAnd, significantly, Arlington National Cemetery displays diverse religious symbols, both as monuments and on individual headstones. Contrast that with the Cross here. There are no other religious symbols present on the Cross or in the entirety of the Veterans Memorial Park [in Bladensburg]. Christianity is singularly\u2014and overwhelmingly\u2014represented.\u201d\n\nThus it always was, and thus it always shall be? There are familiar echoes in this debate to the one over the hundreds of Confederate monuments scattered throughout the nation\u2019s civic spaces. A World War I memorial cross is not, of course, morally equivalent to statuary tributes to treason and white supremacy. But what they share is forcing the country to reckon with how it has morally and culturally changed over its lifespan. They also serve as reminders for how our public history not only excludes Americans today, but may have excluded some of them all along.\n\nThe American Legion and the commission have the unenviable task of convincing the Supreme Court that a four-story rendition of the Christian faith\u2019s most widely recognized symbol is not what it appears to be. The American Humanist Association must instead persuade the justices that the Constitution compels a 90-year-old war memorial\u2019s removal and relocation. The justices\u2019 decision, whatever it may be, will be delivered by the end of June."

His mother, an educator, instructs him to speak the Queen\u2019s English and write book reports on politicians. Laymon follows his mother\u2019s instructions, but he\u2019s more focused on getting near his crush Layla who will be at a nearby swimming pool. All Layla wants to do is float in the deep end of the pool but that desire comes with a price: she has to allow the other teenage boys to run a train on her first. After Layla asks Kiese to accompany her to the pool, Kiese notices something is wrong with her, as it is with him but no one can say what. There\u2019s no resolution to this scene. We don\u2019t know if Layla is ever satisfied in Kiese accompanying her. We don\u2019t know whatever happens to those guys.

When his mother confronts him, he asks if she can help him lose weight. He writes, \u201cI stood there watching you, feeling a lot about what it meant to be a healthy, safe black boy in Mississippi, and wondering why folk never talked about what was needed to keep black girls healthy and safe.\u201d He does not tell his mother why he\u2019s so distracted, but his experience of witnessing harm is a current that courses through the entire book.\n\nThe harm Laymon writes about can also be intergenerational. Kiese\u2019s mother often uses corporal punishment. But she is also abused herself. During a twice-a-week therapy session, she professes her concern that Kiese is eating and drinking things that he shouldn\u2019t be whenever he\u2019s angered and Kiese responds, \u201cI drank Mason jars of box wine three times when there wasn\u2019t anything else to eat or drink because it\u2019s sweeter than water.\u201d His biological father is out of the picture, and Malachi, his mother\u2019s boyfriend, is both abusive and erratic in his love and attention. When his mother and Malachi make love\u2014loudly and vigorously\u2014Kiese gorges upon sweets and more boxed wine, which leaves him so inebriated that he cannot finish his report on Fannie Lou Hamer. The physical evidence of this difficult relationship with his mother\u2014in which so much is left unsaid\u2014is that Kiese weighs almost 300 pounds before he graduates from high school.\n\nOnce Kiese enters Millsaps College, a private liberal arts institution in Jackson, he seeks to leave behind the safety net of eating, and he forsakes meat, eggs, bread, and sugar. He loses over 70 pounds in a single summer. He forms a relationship with a co-ed named Nzola, though they\u2019re often divided by the ways they each grapple with racism on campus. She wants him to understand the gravity of misogynoir and he says that he does; however, he does not broadcast the issue when the press reaches out to him about the tensions at the institution. Nzola also abuses Kiese, often punching him in the face. Just at the moment when Kiese is starting to love his body, another person assaults it\u2014because they are both suffering under the weight of institutionalized oppression.\n\nIn both his account of Nzola\u2019s violence and Malachi\u2019s, Laymon strikes a very delicate balance. He addresses intimate violence but immediately places both situations in the wider context of cycles and patterns of abuse: \u201cWe hated where we were. We hated ourselves. We hated fighting, fucking, fighting, fucking, fighting over who was most violated by a spiteful college president, confused white classmates, and the gated institution we paid to attend.\u201d He does not label himself as a victim, a choice that may seem controversial for some. He\u2019s not holding either Malachi or Nzola accountable and calling them abusers outright, perhaps because he is still working with his traumatic memories.

    "text": "On the surface, Labour\u2019s task should be easy. After two and a half years of Brexit negotiations, Prime Minister Theresa May has failed to build a consensus within her party, let alone Parliament or the country. Her raison d\u2019\u00eatre now hangs like a noose around her neck. There are reports of possible food and medicine shortages and price inflations if no deal is reached. There are weekly cabinet rifts, monthly resignations, and in January, when May finally, belatedly, put her Brexit deal before Parliament, it was voted down by 230 votes\u2014the largest defeat for a government in history.\n\nFor an opposition party, these are surely optimal conditions. And yet, faced with this farce, Labour is either level in the polls with the Conservatives or, on more and more counts, falling behind. Corbyn, whose own approval rating is well below May\u2019s (he has the worst rating of any opposition leader since the 1980s), makes for an easy scapegoat. \u201cThe Tory party is falling to pieces and with a decent Labour leader, it could have been finished off for generations,\u201d James O\u2019Brien, an influential talk show host dubbed \u201cthe conscience of liberal Britain,\u201d said in one characteristic outburst. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to forgive Jeremy Corbyn for his incompetence and his ineffectiveness.\u201d\n\nJeremy Corbyn\u2019s agenda is as much an indictment of Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour as the Conservative Party. JUSTIN TALLIS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThis disbelief, edging on despair, is widely shared. And it\u2019s fed by more than just Corbyn\u2019s alleged incompetence and ineffectiveness. Corbyn stands accused of a dizzying array of charges: a lack of charisma, a ruthless will to power, a callous indifference. Corbyn is described, by turns, as being too principled (pursuing a secret personal desire to leave the EU) and too pragmatic (playing party-politics at a time of national crisis). According to one Guardian columnist, Corbyn exaggerates his disagreements with May \u201cfor theatrical effect\u201d\u2014ultimately they want the same thing. Another liberal critic, playing on the popular perception that Corbyn\u2019s following is a cult, has suggested that the Labour leadership, Communist Manifesto in hand, is \u201ccheering on our steady descent into the abyss\u2014a process they believe will hasten our arrival at the promised land.\u201d\n\nCorbyn\u2019s supporters are accustomed to such attacks and pin the blame for them on a malevolent press and misleading polling. Most of the media, whether the BBC, the Guardian, or the Daily Mail, have been relentlessly hostile toward Corbyn from the start. A 2016 study by the London School of Economics found that nearly 75 percent of coverage misrepresented Corbyn\u2019s views, and Corbyn\u2019s press profile has fared little better since.\n\nMeanwhile, in the 2017 general election, when Labour was even further behind in the polls and Corbyn\u2019s approval rating just as dismal, Labour defied the doubters as its share of the vote soared by the greatest margin since 1945. May had wanted a \u201cBrexit election\u201d and seemed certain of a \u201csupermajority.\u201d But Corbyn stuck to his usual agenda\u2014assailing austerity, inequality, tuition fees\u2014and May was left with a hung Parliament, forced to form a fragile coalition with the small far-right Democratic Unionist Party to remain in government. Corbyn has confounded his critics before, the argument goes, so why won\u2019t he do so again?\n\nYet all this back-and-forth fails to address the unique, paralyzing challenge that Brexit poses to Labour. Brexit, for all its Conservative roots, has opened up an elemental rift within the Labour Party that now threatens its future. This quandary, ethical and electoral, lies beneath Labour\u2019s feet, far below questions of Corbyn\u2019s competence and effectiveness, or his popularity in the polls. The referendum vote cut the country in two, traversing traditional party lines, and, for Labour, landed especially awkwardly.\n\nThe dilemma is clear. The vast majority of Labour wants to remain in the EU: Only ten of the 230 Labour MPs in 2016 voted to leave, while between 80 to 90 percent of the membership and two-thirds of Labour voters wanted to stay. But partly because support for the EU clusters in major cities, the third of Labour voters who backed Brexit is estimated to account for almost two-thirds of Labour\u2019s parliamentary seats. What\u2019s more, 35 of the top 50 target seats for Labour at the next election\u2014those requiring minor swings to switch to Labour\u2014are Leave constituencies.\n\nThe referendum vote cut the country in two, traversing traditional party lines, and, for Labour, landed especially awkwardly.\n\nElectoral abysses lie on either side. If Labour is seen as \u201cenabling Brexit\u201d\u2014in practice, by not backing a second referendum\u2014polls suggest that it could lose as many as 45 seats at the next election. A small Blairite wing of eight Labour MPs has already split to form The Independent Group, joined by several Conservatives, citing the absence of a second referendum as a key reason. Labour\u2019s electoral prospects thus become even bleaker, which is one reason Corbyn finally came out in tentative support of a second referendum on Monday.\n\nBut on the other side, if Labour pitches itself too strongly as the anti-Brexit party, as these splitters suggest, it risks losing not only the Leave constituencies on which it relies\u2014which won on a manifesto that promised to uphold the referendum result\u2014but also the low-hanging seats it must gain at the next election if it is ever to get back into government. With \u201cLeaver\u201d and \u201cRemainer\u201d now the primary ways that people identify politically in the U.K., far above party allegiance, it\u2019s unlikely that this contradiction can be reconciled.\n\nIn this compromised state, many of the moral tenets of so-called Corbynism are called into question as well: that the principled path should be pursued over political expediency; that the membership should be empowered to decide party policy; that the interests of young people\u2014Corbyn\u2019s most reliable voting base and mostly Remainers\u2014would be at the center of his agenda; that Corbyn\u2019s humanitarianism would counter ethno-nationalism\u2019s resurgence in Britain, so emboldened by Brexit and previously appeased by both Blair and Brown. Corbyn\u2019s leadership also promised to re-ingratiate the party with lost heartlands in the North and in Scotland, as it did in the 2017 election, but now, with the former broadly wanting to leave and the latter to remain, they stand opposed to each other.\n\nThere is no easy way out of this. There may be no way out of it at all. But with the Conservative Party still in control of Parliament, with Labour lacking the numbers to win either a second referendum or a general election as it stands, and with Brexit now the key issue on which voters identify, the idea of a Labour leader saving Britain from Brexit is as much a fantasy as the Conservative fever dream of making Britain great again.\n\nFor all their differences, Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party enjoys a strange synergy with the Brexit faithful. Within the space of ten months, between his election as Labour leader in 2015 and the referendum in 2016, both of these onetime fringe political forces upended a status quo that seemed set in stone. And both are now energized by similar structures of feeling: a sense that, somewhere along the way, Britain went astray, with similar turning points imagined\u2014either Britain\u2019s neoliberal transformation under Margaret Thatcher or her decision to join the Single Market.\n\nXenophobia aside, the Brexit campaign could have been a Labour campaign: more money to underfunded public services, overturning an elite consensus, and putting power back in people\u2019s hands. \u201cTake Back Control,\u201d Brexit\u2019s specious slogan, should have been a rallying call for Labour long ago, with its target not Brussels or national borders but social inequality and an over-powerful corporate sector. That this message was instead pushed by Conservatives and the tabloid press, with their own vested interests and rabble-rousing nationalism, only reaffirms just how duplicitous the Brexit campaign really was. But it also represents something of a missed opening for the left.\n\nThe newly established Independent Group includes former members of Labour unhappy with Corbyn\u2019s reluctance to call for a second referendum on Brexit. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nOn one hand, this synergy makes Corbyn a target. In this view, Brexit and Corbyn arrived as one, representing a single, ruinous rupture. For the likes of The Independent Group and their sympathetic supporters in Parliament, the press, and the public, Corbyn\u2019s initial election victory broke British politics as much as Brexit did.\n\nSuch thinking is also at play in the anti-Semitism scandal that has engulfed Corbyn\u2019s leadership. Anti-Semitism is a genuine problem in Labour and the broader British left (gripes with global power structures fold easily into stories of global conspiracy). But it has also elicited an implausible, totemic response from Corbyn\u2019s critics. According to the resignation letter of MP Joan Ryan, as she left Labour for The Independent Group, all previous Labour leaders \u201c[stood] up to racism in all its forms,\u201d while anti-Semitism \u201csimply did not exist in the party before [Corbyn\u2019s] election as leader.\u201d But both Blair and Brown\u2014not to mention their predecessors\u2014often aped the policies and rhetoric of the right when it came to tolerance and diversity. Blair called Muslim veils \u201ca mark of separation\u201d and came close to banning them in schools and hospitals. \u201cOur tolerance is part of what makes Britain, Britain,\u201d Blair said in 2006. \u201cSo conform to it, or don\u2019t come here.\u201d\n\nIn one view, Brexit and Corbyn arrived as one, representing a single, ruinous rupture.\n\nBut on the other hand, the shared resonance between Corbyn and Brexit still stands as an opportunity for the left. The quiet nostalgia of Labour\u2019s new slogan\u2014Rebuilding Britain\u2014makes the connection clear, affirming that, in some important ways, things were once better, and so they can be better again. \u201cThese streets were once full of spirit and hope,\u201d a recent party broadcast declared over footage of a desolate de-industrialized town. \u201cA proud community, where an honest day\u2019s work could earn you a decent day\u2019s pay. Years of austerity have ripped the heart out of this place, but that\u2019s just part of the story: This has been decades in the making. We lost the factories. We lost the jobs. We lost confidence in our community. We lost control.\u201d\n\nFor some, such lamentations are just further evidence that Corbyn is a throwback figure, as anachronistic as Brexit itself. The founding statement of The Independent Group repeated this line of attack, suggesting that Labour under Corbyn was \u201clocked in the old politics of the 20th century.\u201d But for his supporters, Corbyn represents a break from the past, rather than a return to it. From where they stand, nostalgia for a pre-Corbyn, pre-Brexit era makes no sense.\n\nBritain was in a bad way before Brexit and it is in a bad way beyond it. Beneath the hollow Conservative boasts that \u201cmore people are in work than ever before\u201d and the economy \u201chas grown every year for the past nine years,\u201d a bleak set of statistics tells a truer story: Wage growth is at its slowest since records began, some 200 years ago; childhood poverty is forecasted to reach a record high of 37 percent by 2020; household debt is at its highest ever level; homelessness has officially increased by 169 percent since 2010, though the real number is believed to be much higher, such that one person in every 200 in England and Wales is either sleeping rough or in temporary accommodation; in London the figure is 1 in 53; and life expectancy has either stalled or receded\u2014once again, a historic failure.\n\nThe Conservatives\u2019 unwavering, and ongoing, commitment to austerity since 2010\u2014which has starved local councils of funding, depleted essential public services, deepened inequality and resentment, resulted in a reported extra 120,000 deaths, and, according to a recent analysis, shrunk the economy by \u00a3100 billion\u2014has played a key part. But between 1997 and 2010, New Labour was also complicit. Its important successes\u2014reducing child poverty, introducing a minimum wage, investing in public services\u2014were, in Blair\u2019s words, \u201ca spoonful of sugar to help it all go down,\u201d as Labour oversaw an unprecedented financialization of Britain\u2019s economy and all but abandoned working-class voters. \u201cThey have nowhere else to go,\u201d one of Blair\u2019s senior advisers said. And so nowhere they went. By 2010, when Labour achieved its lowest ever share of the vote, the party had shed 1.5 million voters from England\u2019s three northern regions and some 5 million from the working class as a whole.\n\nSo Britain has long been a deeply divided and disillusioned country, home to Western Europe\u2019s richest region\u2014Greater London\u2014and to nine of its ten poorest, making it one of the most unequal countries in the world. This isn\u2019t \u201cBrexit Britain.\u201d This is simply Britain. But while Brexit is not the cause of this condition nor any kind of cure, it also cannot simply be wished away. Corbyn\u2019s hopes of finding unity beyond Brexit appear to be as doomed as trying to find unity through Brexit. \u201cYou\u2019re up against it,\u201d he told Leavers and Remainers in January, stressing their shared struggles, \u201cbut you\u2019re not up against each other.\u201d But given how Brexit identities have hardened on tribal lines, it\u2019s all too likely that they are against each other. Along with everything else, Britain\u2019s chronic economic failings have been subsumed by this crisis of national identity, with no end in sight.\n\nAs to what happens next, nothing is certain. May\u2019s deal is unable to pass Parliament. Each month, she declares she has secured the best possible deal, only to set off in search of a new one. The deadlock must be broken somehow, and so a second referendum seems increasingly likely\u2014not necessarily because Corbyn or Labour\u2019s defectors have taken a stand, but by necessity: a slow exhaustion of alternatives, a stasis with no other escape. Yet there is no agreement on what the question on the referendum would be\u2014the question of the question, as it has come to be called\u2014nor a sense of what a successful campaign to remain would look like.\n\nOne thing is clear: Brexit is not going anywhere soon. For all the resemblances between Corbyn\u2019s movement and Brexit, this is an unhappy coincidence of timing. At the moment when Corbyn arrived to turn the nation\u2019s attention to core issues it had long neglected, Britain decided that it must talk about other things: sovereignty, immigration, the EU. Sometimes, there\u2019s a sense that Corbyn arrived too late, so that he could never really arrive at all.\n\nBut Corbyn\u2019s popularity rests on his politics rather than his personality. And that\u2019s not going anywhere either. The ideas he represents, far more than the man himself, have energized a new generation of voters and widened the realm of political possibility. In an interview after the 2017 general election, Corbyn, now 69 years old, was asked if he was in it for the long haul. \u201cLook at me,\u201d he smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve got youth on my side.\u201d In one sense, it\u2019s a good joke; in another, he is exactly right."

    "text": "\u201cIt will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive,\u201d she said recently. \u201cThe green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they\u2019re for it right?\u201d\n\nThat quote led many to believe that Pelosi was dismissive of the Green New Deal and the activists who support it. The Rolling Stone interview suggests otherwise. \u201cI\u2019d probably be doing that myself,\u201d she told the magazine in reference to the recent protests of her led by the Sunrise Movement. Pelosi has applauded the climate group\u2019s efforts, leading Vox\u2019s David Roberts\u2014one of the media\u2019s most prominent voices for immediate, sweeping action on climate change\u2014to argue that \u201cshe and AOC are working together on this, not at odds.\u201d As Pelosi told Rolling Stone, \u201cI understand that to be an advocate you are persistent, dissatisfied and relentless. I\u2019ve been there. I understand it. You have that responsibility as an advocate.\u201d\n\nBut Pelosi also told Rolling Stone she has a \u201cdifferent responsibility as a leader\u201d\u2014not to shape public opinion, but to respond to it. \u201cYou have to make decisions that you\u2019re going to reach certain goals, and some of our goals we think are achievable,\u201d she said. Pelosi recognizes that she alone can\u2019t convince Democrats\u2014much less Republicans\u2014to support something their constituents don\u2019t want. And she can\u2019t put a Green New Deal to a vote knowing it will lose. \u201cThat\u2019s why public opinion is so important,\u201d she added. \u201cYoung people know better than people who serve here in Congress that [solving climate change] is important to do.\u201d She\u2019s essentially imploring climate activists to gather enough support for the Green New Deal to make it palatable to elected officials.\n\nThe Green New Deal is indeed unachievable at this moment. But the politics of an issue can change in a flash. It has taken Green New Deal activists mere months to transform the climate policy conversation in Washington. Pelosi sees that\u2014and wants them to keep it up. \u201cWe have to take it to the public, and I think it should be an important part of the presidential campaign,\u201d she told Rolling Stone. \u201cEverything that we\u2019re talking about has to be elevated to the presidential level.\u201d\n\nClimate activists have reason to remain wary of Pelosi. She calls global warming \u201cthe challenge of this generation,\u201d but doesn\u2019t appear to have a strong understanding of the Green New Deal and has expressed skepticism about its ambitious reach. She told Rolling Stone that the Green New Deal resolution \u201cgoes beyond what our charge is\u201d because it also proposes single-payer healthcare and a federal jobs guarantee. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of, like, a broader agenda,\u201d Pelosi said."

    ],
    "text": "And yet, amid the party\u2019s decisive shift leftward, pragmatism threatens once again to smother ambitious new policies in the crib. \u201cDo I think we could cross every \u2018t\u2019 and dot every \u2018i\u2019 in 10 years?\u201d Klobuchar said when asked about the Green New Deal. \u201cActually, I think that would be very difficult to do.\u201d Such caution inspires portrayals of her as a plain-speaking politician who doesn\u2019t pander, an incrementalist who doesn\u2019t let the perfect be the enemy of the good\u2014a doer, not a dreamer. But one person\u2019s realism is another other person\u2019s myopia: What is possible tomorrow is shaped by what is attempted today, however impossible the odds seem.\n\nPragmatism is as much a political strategy as a legislative one. Most voters are realists, not zealots, the thinking goes; by embracing pragmatism, presidential candidates like Klobuchar can win over this silent majority. It\u2019s easy to see the appeal of such an approach in this political moment. Polling has shown that Democratic voters are eager to elect anyone who can defeat Trump\u2014and would prefer that the party nominate the candidate with the best chance of beating him. Some argue that the best such candidate, given the president\u2019s extremism, would be a centrist pragmatist.\n\n\u201cDespite all the talk about how \u2018all the energy is on the left,\u2019 progressive populism and democratic socialism underwhelmed in the primaries and were close to shut out in competitive general elections,\u201d Jim Kessler and Lanae Erickson, of the Third Way think tank, argued after last year\u2019s midterms. \u201cThe actual voting energy in the midterms propelled mostly mainstream Democrats who closely matched their purple and red districts or states.... Presidential candidates should not conflate that with appealing to the far left with populist rhetoric and a democratic socialist agenda.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that most voters do not fall into neat ideological boxes. As Lee Drutman found in 2017, most social and racial conservatives have liberal economic views, while liberals, contra much of the reporting on the divide between Sanders and Clinton supporters, were in broad agreement on economic issues. Moreover, as New York magazine\u2019s Eric Levitz wrote in 2017, \u201cpeople generally cast their ballots on the basis of which candidate or party they identify with\u2014which is to say, the one that seems to best represent people like them.\u201d This generally favors the political party pushing for greater, more affordable health care\u2014but also means that it doesn\u2019t make political sense to put bumpers on hypothetical policies, which dampens voter enthusiasm.\n\nPragmatism doesn\u2019t track as a legislative argument, either. There is justified skepticism, given the Senate\u2019s structural favoritism toward Republicans, that any major Democratic effort can become law. But this is also true of any major piece of legislation at this point, whether it be universal or incremental. It\u2019s possible, for instance, that Klobuchar\u2019s hypothetical smaller-scale health care push could hold on to more Democratic votes than Medicare for All\u2014but there is no sense that it would win any more votes from Republicans. Despite the label, there\u2019s nothing really that pragmatic about these policies, at least in this hyper-partisan moment. (The actual pragmatic position is the one that no Democratic candidate has taken: If they want to pass any meaningful legislation, they must abolish the filibuster. For now, however, that remains a curious third rail among leading Democrats.)\n\nAs they travel across Iowa and New Hampshire, Klobuchar and other moderate Democrats running for president would do well to remember the campaign of another Minnesota pragmatist, Walter Mondale. In December of 1983, The New York Times observed a sense of nervousness among his supporters: \u201cEven some Democrats supporting Mr. Mondale voice concerns that, despite his elaborate organization, the candidate\u2019s stolid, low-key personality and his cautious, pragmatic approach have left many Democrats uninspired.\u201d Eleven months later, the Democratic Party lost every state but the one Mondale hailed from. There\u2019s no reason to believe that a pragmatic nominee today, whether from Minnesota or anywhere else, would be more inspiring."

    "text": "Let\u2019s start with the bad so that we may hasten to the good: Queer swagger can be corny. The only bum note in Michelle Tea\u2019s new essay collection Against Memoir is in a piece about her time on the road in the queer feminist spoken-word collective Sister Spit. She co-founded the group in 1994 with Sini Anderson (who directed the 2013 documentary The Punk Singer about Kathleen Hanna), and the crew crisscrossed America \u201cdelighting audiences and racking up adventures\u201d from their rickety van, inside crazy outfits. Sister Spit was a very, very cool project, and its members surely had glorious fun.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe needed the right to ruin our lives and crawl out from the wreckage, maybe wiser,\u201d Tea writes. She and her companions hit the road to get dirty and heroic. But romanticism is not always the happiest bedfellow to essay-writing, particularly when it veers into sentimentality. \u201cWe needed the right to start a stupid brawl and emerge victorious or with a black eye,\u201d she writes. The essay reminded me of a person who can\u2019t stop telling wild stories about themselves.\n\nAnd yet the very problem with the Sister Spit essay\u2014the mixing of feminist critique and queer nostalgia\u2014is the glorious core of Against Memoir, the best essay collection I\u2019ve read in years.\n\nTea is now a sober and married mom, but she turns again and again to her youth as a poor femme running drunkenly away from Chelsea, Massachusetts. The book is divided into sections: \u201cArt and Music\u201d; \u201cLove and Queerness\u201d; \u201cWriting and Life.\u201d But these subjects all overlap. The opening essay on Valerie Solanas is Tea in crystallized form. \u201cI was thinking a certain way when I first came across the SCUM Manifesto,\u201d she writes\u2014and that way was determined by circumstances that were shaping her nascent identity. She had just discovered that her stepfather had been spying on her and her sister through holes in the wall of the family home."

I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump\u2019s illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience.\u201d On multiple occasions, Cohen reminded lawmakers that he would not benefit from his testimony, and that it would not reduce the length of his upcoming prison sentence.\n\nOn Trump himself, Cohen gave a familiar portrait of the president: mercurial, strangely charismatic, and driven by unvarnished self-interest above all else. \u201cMr. Trump is an enigma,\u201d he told the committee. \u201cHe is complicated, as am I. He has both good and bad, as do we all. But the bad far outweighs the good, and since taking office, he has become the worst version of himself. He is capable of behaving kindly, but he is not kind. He is capable of committing acts of generosity, but he is not generous. He is capable of being loyal, but he is fundamentally disloyal.\u201d\n\nThat paradox was a recurring theme in his testimony. \u201cEverybody\u2019s job at the Trump Organization is to protect Mr. Trump,\u201d he later told lawmakers. He even confirmed that Trump\u2019s presidential run was a publicity stunt to enrich Trump further. \u201cMr. Trump would often say, this campaign was going to be the \u2018greatest infomercial in political history,\u2019\u201d he told the committee. \u201cHe never expected to win the primary. He never expected to win the general election. The campaign\u2014for him\u2014was always a marketing opportunity.\u201d Making America great again was a racket, in other words, and the American people were the marks.\n\nIn Cohen\u2019s telling, Trump uses vague and elliptical statements to instruct his subordinates to commit wrongdoings on his behalf. \u201cMr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how he operates.\u201d Instead, Cohen said, Trump would \u201clook me in the eye\u201d during the campaign and say that he wasn\u2019t conducting business in Russia\u2014even while Cohen worked on his behalf toward a Trump hotel project in Moscow. \u201cIn his way, he was telling me to lie,\u201d he explained.\n\nThis description of Trump\u2019s behavior is all too familiar. Former FBI Director James Comey documented how Trump repeatedly tried to elicit his loyalty during their one-on-one interactions in early 2017, telling him that he \u201cneeded loyalty.\u201d Though Trump did not directly order Comey to drop the investigation into former national security advisor Michael Flynn, he made his intentions plain. \u201cI hope you can let this go,\u201d Trump reportedly told the FBI director shortly after Flynn\u2019s ouster that February. The investigation continued apace, and Comey was fired four months later.\n\n"

    "text": "Why would Manafort implode a deal that would secure him a shorter prison sentence? Trump\u2019s implicit offer of pardons appears to have played a role. The Russia investigation always operated under this sword of Damocles. Presidential pardons don\u2019t affect state prosecutions, however, making the latter a fail-safe of sorts in case the president started to shut down Mueller\u2019s inquiry. The special counsel\u2019s office reportedly began working with the New York attorney general\u2019s office in the summer of 2017 on the financial-crimes portion of Manafort\u2019s case. Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. is also reportedly preparing to file charges against Manafort soon.\n\n\n\nTrump has been signaling his views on the pardon power for years. In August 2017, he pardoned former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was convicted of contempt of court for racially profiling Hispanic motorists despite a judge\u2019s order to desist. Last summer, Trump also wiped away conservative filmmaker Dinesh D\u2019Souza\u2019s conviction for campaign finance violations. Both men staunchly support the president and blamed politicized investigations for their downfall. While Trump isn\u2019t the first president to misuse the power of mercy, the two pardons made it unusually clear that he would wield pardons for purely partisan gain.\n\nAfter a Virginia jury convicted Manafort on multiple charges last August, Trump became even less subtle. The president publicly lauded his former campaign chairman for refusing to \u201cmake up stories in order to get a \u2018deal\u2019\u201d while harshly criticizing Michael Cohen, his former personal attorney, for cooperating with investigators. Hours later, Rudy Giuliani told reporters that the president wouldn\u2019t be issuing any pardons until the investigation had wrapped up. Taken together, the two messages suggested pardons would be on the table if their potential recipients kept quiet. The New York Times reported earlier this month that Trump\u2019s lawyers made similar assurances in private as well.\n\nThese efforts haven\u2019t gone unnoticed by the special counsel\u2019s office. In a sealed hearing earlier this month, Mueller\u2019s team offered two motives for why Manafort lied to them about part of the investigation. One of those motives is obscured by a thicket of partial redactions in the official transcript; the other is that telling the truth could have \u201cnegative consequences in terms of the other motive that Mr. Manafort could have, which is to at least augment his chances of a pardon.\u201d\n\nMost discussions of the Russia investigation center around the most important line of Mueller\u2019s inquiry: whether the Trump campaign illegally conspired with the Russian government during the 2016 election. But even if Mueller doesn\u2019t find evidence of this, his investigation has already proven its worth by uncovering a viper\u2019s nest of illegal conduct during the 2016 election. He shed light on how Russian operatives used social media networks to manipulate and influence public opinion. He uncovered suspicious contacts between Russian operatives and Trump campaign officials, and showed how they lied to keep those contacts hidden from the public. He also may have uncovered serious wrongdoing by the Trump Organization and the president\u2019s inaugural committee, both of which are now under investigation by federal prosecutors in New York and Washington."

    "text": "Although Diderot presented these ideas as the visions of a dying man rather than as his own beliefs, they went too far for the government censors. Shortly after dawn on July 24, two officers entered Diderot\u2019s apartment bearing a lettre de cachet. They searched his papers and placed him under arrest, taking him to solitary confinement in the Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes east of Paris. A lettre de cachet was a fearsome instrument of royal prerogative, a direct order from the king that could not be appealed and carried no right to trial. Diderot might well have disappeared forever in the chateau\u2019s dungeon.\n\nBenefiting from the intervention of powerful friends, however, he was freed in November of that year, after more than 100 days of confinement. As part of his release deal, he signed a statement admitting that his writings were \u201cdebaucheries of the mind that escaped from me.\u201d He promised, \u201con my honor (and I do have honor) that they will be the last.\u201d For the most part, he kept his word. Although only in his mid-thirties at the time, he published little in the second half of his life. Instead, he set to work as editor of the most ambitious intellectual enterprise of the century.\n\nBefore his arrest, Diderot and his friend Jean le Rond d\u2019Alembert had hit on the idea of assembling a compendium of all human knowledge. Having secured printers to produce the work and subscribers to fund it, they now embarked on the \u201cSystematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts\u201d they called the Encyclopedia. The reign of dilettantes, obfuscating clerics, and secretive guilds was over, they insisted. This would be the work of experts and professionals, written for anyone who wished to know how the world operates.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe distributed the appropriate piece to each,\u201d Diderot boasted. \u201cMathematics to the mathematician; fortifications to the engineer; chemistry to the chemist\u2026 each person only what he understood.\u201d While many of the articles were dry and technical, the enterprise had an ideological aim from the start. The point of the Encyclopedia, Diderot wrote, was to ensure that \u201cthe work of centuries past is not useless to the centuries which follow, that our descendants, by becoming more learned, may become more virtuous and happier, and that we do not die without having merited being part of the human race.\u201d\n\nDiderot soon took over as chief editor and for more than two decades, between 1750 and the publication of the final volume in 1772, guided and sustained a publishing project that staggers the mind. The Encyclopedia ran to 28 large volumes, containing more than 70,000 entries and 3,000 illustrations. Approximately 150 writers contributed to the work, producing more than 20 million words in total. They included Diderot, d\u2019Alembert, Montesquieu, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Voltaire. The most prolific contributor was the Chevalier de Jaucourt, an aristocrat who had plenty of time on his hands and a stupendous work ethic. Between 1759 and 1765, with a team of researchers hired at his own expense, he wrote more than 17,000 articles, averaging about eight per day, equaling a quarter of the total word count.\n\nBetween 1759 and 1765, with a team of researchers hired at his own expense, he wrote more than 17,000 articles, averaging about eight per day.\n\nTo fulfill its ideological purpose, the Encyclopedia needed not only to explicate the most advanced knowledge of its time but also to encourage the attitudes that motivated these discoveries. It taught its readers to be bold, curious, iconoclastic, and independent. In doing so, it undercut much of the political culture and religious dogma of eighteenth-century France. The authorities stopped the project on two separate occasions, and Diderot lived in constant fear of arrest.\n\nHe \u201cengineered the dissemination of subversive ideas,\u201d as Curran puts it, through a series of brilliant and often hilarious stratagems. Most simply, he would sometimes commission an essay from a conservative thinker and then insert a passage of his own at the end that undercut the entire entry. In an article on the soul, for example, a Catholic apologist stated that the soul is the seat of reason, immaterial, immortal, and a separate substance from the body. After 17,000 words of tedious disquisition, the reader comes to a final note inserted by Diderot. Since the soul is separate from the body, it remains puzzling why a blow to the head affects one\u2019s reason.\n\nThe Encyclopedia also makes pitiless use of irony. The article on \u201cNoah\u2019s Ark\u201d offers a matter-of-fact discussion of what would be involved in building such a boat, populating it with animals, feeding them, and getting rid of their manure. Merely saying it shows its absurdity. By accepting dogmas at face value, the Encyclopedia mocks religious orthodoxy while appearing to honor it. Diderot\u2019s most ingenious device, however, was his use of cross-references. The Encyclopedia often gives a straight-forward entry on a topic only then to include cross-references to unrelated articles implying things that could never be said. The entry on \u201cCannibals,\u201d for instance, gives cross-references to \u201cCommunion\u201d and \u201cEucharist.\u201d\n\nFor all this cleverness, the Encyclopedia did fulfill its goal of transmitting the cutting edge of science, technology, and engineering around Europe, the Atlantic world, and eventually the globe. Its success was due in no small part to its illustrations. A team of artists under Diderot\u2019s direction spent years travelling everywhere from bakeries, hospitals, and iron foundries to military installations, pin factories, and shipyards. Their drawings were so accurate and detailed that a world-class technical school could be founded, or a nation\u2019s economy could be reconfigured, by acquiring a copy of the Encyclopedia. The demand was insatiable. By the early 1780s, nearly 25,000 sets had been printed and sold.\n\nWhile Diderot refrained from publishing anything controversial in his own name after his imprisonment, he continued to write. His most famous works today, aside from the Encyclopedia, were written to appear after his death. \u201cPosterity,\u201d he quipped, \u201cis for the philosopher what the next world is for the man of religion.\u201d The three most enduring of these, Rameau\u2019s Nephew, D\u2019Alembert\u2019s Dream, and Jacques the Fatalist, subject Diderot\u2019s philosophical views (primarily atheism and materialism) to the same skeptical interrogation that his earlier works employed against the teachings of the church. The books are astoundingly modern. Self-referential, occasionally self-contradictory, on the edge of spinning into nonsense, they give free rein to Diderot\u2019s whirligig of a mind. The narrator of Rameau\u2019s Nephew writes of himself: \u201cI give in to my mind\u2019s every fancy. I let it be my master and allow it to pursue the first idea that comes to it, good or mad.\u201d Curran calls this pattern of thought Diderot\u2019s \u201cmental libertinage.\u201d\n\nAs an original thinker, Diderot did not reach the level of Lucretius, Spinoza, or the other great philosophers whose ideas influenced his. Yet he excelled as a guide to philosophical concepts. In D\u2019Alembert\u2019s Dream, a fictionalized d\u2019Alembert challenges the materialism of a fictionalized Diderot. If a soul is not necessary for consciousness, d\u2019Alembert asks, why not say a stone can feel just as a human being does. \u201cWhy not?\u201d Diderot replies: Take a stone statue, grind it up, mix it into the soil, grow a crop, and eat it. The matter is conscious when it is part of a person. Why not say it was conscious when it was part of a statue? Diderot\u2019s vision of the universe as a vast expanse of combining and recombining matter led him to a host of original ideas. Perhaps, for example, hermaphroditism is the basic condition of animal life, from which male and female are deviants. Or, again, perhaps heterosexuality and homosexuality are not distinct categories but rather two extremes on a spectrum of desires. \u201cNothing that exists,\u201d he wrote, \u201ccan be against nature or outside of nature.\u201d\n\nWhile Diderot and Toinette had risked all to be together, their marriage was not especially happy. Diderot became a workaholic and was also unfaithful to her. Toinette developed a fearsome temper and was physically violent. In 1755, Diderot met the woman who would be the significant influence on the later part of his life\u2014a wealthy, brilliant, 38-year-old named Louise-Henriette Volland. He called her Sophie after the Greek word for wisdom. The 187 surviving letters that Diderot wrote to Sophie are treasures of eighteenth-century literature. One summer night in 1759, for example, he went to visit her but found that she was out or asleep and did not answer the door. In the pitch black, he took out a piece of paper and began to write.\n\nI am writing without being able to see.... I am writing you that I love you.\u2026 I am unable to leave. The hope of seeing you for a moment is holding me back, and I continue to speak to you without knowing if I am actually forming letters. Wherever you see nothing [on this page], read that I love you.\n\nDiderot\u2019s gift of expressing his thoughts and feelings as they were happening to him achieves its most gripping effects in these letters.\n\nAs he reached old age, Diderot did not suffer the fears or regrets that his Christian friends expected he would. He was happy to imagine that the matter of which he was composed would be returned to the earth and reconfigured into something new. In one of his most touching letters, he imagines that he and Sophie would be buried next to each other so that their \u201cashes might press and mix together and unite.\u201d He continues, \u201cMaybe they haven\u2019t lost all feeling or the memories of their earlier state\u2026. I could touch you, feel you, love you, look for you, unite myself with you, and combine myself with you when we are no longer.\u201d Curran says of this letter, \u201cDiderot\u2019s molecules scurry about in a quest for the carnal and intellectual joy that he had felt in an earlier life.\u201d\n\nThe man who had almost starved to death as a young layabout, spent his final days in a palatial Right Bank apartment supported by the Empress of Russia.\n\nDiderot and Toinette eventually reconciled, helping each other through serious illnesses late in life. By this time, they were a wealthy couple. The Encyclopedia had been an unprecedented success. Moreover, Catherine the Great, who admired the Encyclopedia and Diderot\u2019s freewheeling intellect, offered him an extraordinary gift. She would buy his library for 15,000 livres on the condition that he keep the books as long as he lived. Moreover, she would pay him 1,000 livres per year to take care of his books and would pay the first 50 years in advance. (He would be 102 before the next installment was due.) The man who had almost starved to death as a young layabout and been twice imprisoned, once by his father and again by the king, spent his final days in a palatial Right Bank apartment supported by the Empress of Russia.\n\n\n\nIn July of 1784, workmen arrived with a new bed for the elderly writer. As they labored to assemble it, Diderot told them, \u201cMy friends, you are giving yourself a lot of trouble for a piece of furniture that will only be used for four days.\u201d He died the next afternoon. Diderot was different than most philosophers from Plato to the present. He loved the things that make others uneasy: ambiguity, change, doubt, idiosyncrasy, spontaneity, and the pleasures of the flesh. When his own body expired, suddenly and peacefully, he was with Toinette at their luncheon table, enjoying a second helping of dessert."

    "text": "The response was explosive. Democrats like Representative Ted Lieu of California suggested impeachment proceedings could arise from Trump\u2019s apparent obstruction of justice. Even House Judiciary Chair Jerry Nadler, who has cautioned against a rush to impeachment, asserted, \u201cWe know that the President has engaged in a long pattern of obstruction,\u201d before promising, \u201cThe @HouseJudiciary Committee\u2019s job is to get to the bottom of it, and we will do that work.\u201d (The House Judiciary Committee would oversee any impeachment inquiry.)\n\nThe alarm wasn\u2019t limited to Democrats. White House spokesperson Hogan Gidley, after claiming to Fox News that media outlets were \u201cjust using innuendo and shady sources,\u201d still did not deny the story. Fox\u2019s Chris Wallace, while warning to take the BuzzFeed story \u201cwith a giant grain of salt,\u201d admitted, \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of thing that can get you impeached.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that William Barr, Trump\u2019s nominee to be attorney general, agreed twice in his confirmation hearing last week that if a president encouraged someone to testify falsely it would amount to obstruction of justice. Barr agreed that a president\u2014or any person\u2014who persuades a person to commit perjury or change testimony would be committing obstruction. Barr also concurred when Senator Lindsey Graham asked, \u201cIf there was some reason to believe that the president tried to coach somebody not to testify or to testify falsely, that could be obstruction of justice.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s lawyers were apparently so anxious that, according to multiple news outlets, they \u201craised concerns\u201d in a letter to Mueller\u2019s office. And according to The Washington Post, the office of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein called Mueller\u2019s office to find out if he would be releasing a statement.\n\nWhen the statement from Mueller\u2019s office finally dropped, the discussion of impeachment, which had rapidly grown rampant, was curbed. But what we know so far indicates that Trump, in at least one previously known case involving Don Jr., scripted someone to lie under oath, which means that all the concerns voiced by Democrats and Fox News anchors in response to the BuzzFeed story remain as valid as ever. It\u2019s the kind of thing that can get you impeached.\n\nFurthermore, the special counsel\u2019s statement did not exonerate the president, rare as it might be for his office to rebuke the press. The statement merely distinguished what that office had obtained in its investigation from what BuzzFeed said the office had obtained. That\u2019s significant because, in Cohen\u2019s case, Mueller\u2019s prosecutors are working with another Justice Department office, the Southern District of New York, on parallel prosecutions. Indeed, FBI agents working with SDNY conducted the raid on Michael Cohen\u2019s home in April, gathering information that was then shared with Mueller\u2019s people.\n\nIndeed, there are notable differences in the way the two prosecutions characterize the degree to which Trump\u2014referred to as Individual-1 or Client-1 rather than by name\u2014directed Cohen\u2019s illegal conduct. With respect to hush payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, Cohen admitted in the SDNY case that he acted \u201con Client-1\u2019s instruction, to attempt to prevent [women alleging to be the Candidate\u2019s former sex partners] from disseminating narratives that would adversely affect [his] Campaign.\u201d By contrast, in Mueller\u2019s case, Cohen claimed that, when he lied to Congress about the Trump Tower deal in Moscow, he was \u201cseeking to stay in line with\u201d the message Trump and \u201cWhite House-based staff and legal counsel to Trump\u201d were pushing regarding Trump\u2019s ties to Russia.\n\nThat is, in pleading guilty to SDNY prosecutors, Cohen said Trump \u201cinstructed\u201d him to take action. But in pleading guilty to Mueller\u2019s prosecutors, Cohen said he was following the messaging of Trump\u2019s advisers, without claiming to have been instructed to do so. In both cases, however, Cohen said loyalty to Trump led him to commit crimes to sustain Trump\u2019s desired message.\n\nThis dynamic may be why it has been so hard for other news outlets to do what BuzzFeed did: to state that Trump induces his aides to lie, not just as a routine matter, but also in ways that break the law. Trump gets those around him to lie in a different manner than past presidents.\n\nUnder Trump, the lies are facilitated not through any kind of bureaucratic genius, but instead through an insistence that underlings toe the public line.\n\nConsider how some of George W. Bush\u2019s most disastrous lies worked. With both the claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and that the CIA was just vigorously interrogating detainees rather than torturing them, Bush\u2019s top aides either ensured he retained plausible deniability to the lies or his public claims were technically correct. It was technically true that, \u201cThe British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.\u201d Left unsaid was that the U.S. government had already judged that Saddam didn\u2019t actually obtain the uranium he sought.\n\nWith Bush\u2019s lies, the buck often stopped with Vice President Dick Cheney. And Cheney exploited his bureaucratic genius, both inside and outside government, to ensure message discipline. One reason Cheney started collecting information on Valerie Plame and her husband Joe Wilson\u2019s trip to Niger, in an effort that would lead to the disclosure of her CIA status, was because CIA analysts close to Plame were leaking details of what the CIA had really known to the press. Similarly, people close to Cheney had a hand in the consistent use of \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d in the most secret realms of government, in memos rubber-stamping the torture, and on the front page of The New York Times.\n\nThere is no such plausible deniability in the Trump administration. Under Trump, the lies are facilitated not through any kind of bureaucratic genius, but instead through an insistence that underlings toe the public line. These lies include more innocuous ones like inauguration attendance, as well as more serious ones involving Trump\u2019s awareness that a Russian linked to military intelligence was brokering a $300 million real estate deal at the same time that Russia\u2019s military intelligence was offering dirt stolen from Trump opponent\u2019s server to his son.\n\nIn fact, that\u2019s the theory presented in all three of Mueller\u2019s cases in which a Trump aide lied about matters pertaining directly to Russia\u2019s involvement in the campaign. Under oath, Cohen explained that he lied about the Trump Tower deal \u201cto be consistent with Individual 1\u2019s political messaging and out of loyalty to Individual 1.\u201d\n\nIn his sentencing memo, George Papadopoulos said his lies about Russians offering the campaign Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails were not meant to impede the investigation but \u201cto save his professional aspirations and preserve a perhaps misguided loyalty to his master.\u201d By his own account, Papadopoulos lied \u201cout of loyalty to the new president and his desire to be part of the administration.\u201d\n\nAnd in explaining why former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn told lies\u2014which included false statements to the FBI about his communications with the Russian ambassador to the U.S.\u2014the government said, \u201cBy the time of the FBI interview,\u201d Flynn \u201cwas committed to his false story.\u201d We know that Flynn took those actions, in part, to avoid a \u201ctit-for-tat escalation\u201d that would make it difficult to improve relations with the Russians after they had just \u201cthrown [the] USA election\u201d to Trump, according to Flynn\u2019s deputy K.T. McFarland.\n\nMueller has hinted that Trump\u2019s other subordinates were involved in just one of these lies: Cohen\u2019s. In a filing describing how Cohen explained \u201cthe circumstances of preparing and circulating his response to the congressional inquiries,\u201d Cohen suggested he coordinated with \u201cWhite House-based staff and legal counsel to Trump.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what the public record shows happened with Don Jr.\u2019s statements about the Trump Tower meeting, in which he falsely claimed there was no \u201cfollow-up.\u201d** Trump dictated that line himself in July of 2017, and his camp has never deviated from it.* Trump Organization lawyers urged Rob Goldstone, who set up the meeting, to endorse the claim. They did this even though they had to have known it wasn\u2019t true. Indeed, less than a week after Trump\u2019s lawyers tried to get Goldstone to back him up, Trump\u2019s assistant forwarded Goldstone an email he sent her the prior year, showing it to be false.\n\nSo where do all the lies come from? The record indicates that Trump decides what lie is going to be told, and the people around him, indirectly or otherwise, do what they need to sustain it, even if it includes lying to Congress, the FBI, and Mueller\u2019s team.\n\n\n\nLegally, the difference between ordering someone to lie and simply ensuring they follow your message out of abject loyalty may not save Trump. There is one law, subornation of perjury, that imposes up to five years in prison if a person \u201cprocures another to commit any perjury.\u201d Even aside from whether Trump personally directed his aides to tell lies, the crime Trump\u2019s aides, including Cohen, have been prosecuted for thus far has been false statements, not perjury. A more basic law makes it a crime to \u201caid, abet, counsel, command, induce, or procure\u201d an offense against the United States, in which case that person can be charged \u201cas a principal.\u201d In past presidential cover-ups, conspiracy to obstruct justice was charged. So Trump could be on the hook for the lies he encouraged his subordinates to tell, too, sometimes with the help of his lawyers.\n\nIn this administration, the president doesn\u2019t need to order his subordinates to lie for him. It\u2019s a daily matter of course. Mueller\u2019s team seems to be wise to that, even if Congress and much of the media aren\u2019t quite there yet.\n\n*A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Donald Trump asserted to his team in 2016 that there was no follow-up to the Trump Tower meeting. He made the assertion in 2017. We regret the error.\n\n**A previous version of this article incorrectly attributed a statement claiming there was no follow-up. The statement was made by Donald Trump Jr., not Michael Cohen."

    "text": "While the two sides differ on how they interpret the Establishment Clause, the greater gulf is in how they interpret American history. To the American Legion, the Bladensburg cross only reflects a community\u2019s patriotic desire to commemorate its war dead. Any religious symbolism, they argue, is secondary to its secular purpose of honoring American soldiers. \u201cThe builders\u2019 decision to create a cross-shaped memorial reflects the fact that, during WWI, crosses became a well-recognized symbol of the losses of the war,\u201d the group explains.\n\nThe AHA disputed the suggestion that Christianity could represent all those who died in the conflict. \u201cWhen the government prominently displays a large Latin cross as a war memorial, it does more than just align the state with Christianity; it also callously discriminates against patriotic soldiers who are not Christian,\u201d they told the court. Transmuting the cross into a symbol of world war also did not go unchallenged. \u201cThat distortion should be rejected, not only because it amounts to legal chicanery, but also because it works the very kind of harm to religion that motivated the Establishment Clause\u2019s passage,\u201d the group argued.\n\nTo refute the cross\u2019s supposedly ecumenical appeal, they also drew upon darker aspects of the state\u2019s history. In the 1920s, Maryland law made it illegal \u201cto blaspheme or curse God or write or utter profane words about our Saviour Jesus Christ or of and concerning the Trinity or any of the persons thereof,\u201d the AHA told the court. The state also imposed a religious test to exclude atheists from public office until 1961. Nearby towns used restrictive covenants to keep prospective Jewish homeowners out of their communities at the time. The group pointed to local reports that the Ku Klux Klan marched in 1925 from \u201cthe peace cross at Bladensburg to the fiery cross at Lanham,\u201d and claimed that Klansmen were also often members of American Legion chapters at the time. \u201cDo we really want to settle on a test that fails to consider the values that our nation has developed since that era?\u201d the AHA asked the court.\n\n\u201cThese claims are as ludicrous as they are revolting,\u201d the American Legion shot back in its reply brief. The veterans\u2019 organization pointed to testimony from the AHA\u2019s own expert that the Legion was a \u201cremarkably diverse and ecumenical organization\u201d in the 1920s, with thousands of Catholic and Jewish members. Among them, the Legion said, was J. Moses Edlavitch, a Jewish veteran who ranked among the local chapter\u2019s leaders and signed the deed for the land upon which the monument was eventually built.\n\nThough the American Legion and the commission stressed the cross\u2019s non-sectarian nature, other supporters of the Bladensburg cross warned that its removal would threaten other Christian symbols in American civic life. The Thomas More Law Center, in its own friend-of-the-court brief, argued that the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision itself \u201cdemonstrates a hostility towards religion\u201d that the First Amendment prohibits. The conservative legal organization then denigrated the beliefs of those challenging the cross\u2019s placement. \u201cAllowing a historic war memorial to be destroyed to quell some momentary discomfort plaintiffs feel when they drive past the Bladensburg monument would do real and lasting harm to this country,\u201d the group told the court.\n\nSome of the monument\u2019s other supporters went even further. The Foundation for Moral Law, a legal advocacy group founded by former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, filed a friend-of-the-court brief noting that the National Mall in Washington, D.C. also resembles a crucifix. \u201cIf Congress can expressly reference the Latin cross as the basis for the plan for the National Mall, the City of Bladensburg can erect a Latin cross as a memorial to American veterans,\u201d the group told the court. \u201cOr must we now plow under the National Mall?\u201d\n\nThe Fourth Circuit dispensed with slippery-slope arguments in its ruling last year when the American Legion and the commission both warned that monuments at Arlington National Cemetery would be imperiled if they lost. \u201cThe crosses there are much smaller than the 40\u2013foot tall monolith at issue here,\u201d Thacker noted. \u201cAnd, significantly, Arlington National Cemetery displays diverse religious symbols, both as monuments and on individual headstones. Contrast that with the Cross here. There are no other religious symbols present on the Cross or in the entirety of the Veterans Memorial Park [in Bladensburg]. Christianity is singularly\u2014and overwhelmingly\u2014represented.\u201d\n\nThus it always was, and thus it always shall be? There are familiar echoes in this debate to the one over the hundreds of Confederate monuments scattered throughout the nation\u2019s civic spaces. A World War I memorial cross is not, of course, morally equivalent to statuary tributes to treason and white supremacy. But what they share is forcing the country to reckon with how it has morally and culturally changed over its lifespan. They also serve as reminders for how our public history not only excludes Americans today, but may have excluded some of them all along.\n\nThe American Legion and the commission have the unenviable task of convincing the Supreme Court that a four-story rendition of the Christian faith\u2019s most widely recognized symbol is not what it appears to be. The American Humanist Association must instead persuade the justices that the Constitution compels a 90-year-old war memorial\u2019s removal and relocation. The justices\u2019 decision, whatever it may be, will be delivered by the end of June."

    "text": "Although Diderot presented these ideas as the visions of a dying man rather than as his own beliefs, they went too far for the government censors. Shortly after dawn on July 24, two officers entered Diderot\u2019s apartment bearing a lettre de cachet. They searched his papers and placed him under arrest, taking him to solitary confinement in the Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes east of Paris. A lettre de cachet was a fearsome instrument of royal prerogative, a direct order from the king that could not be appealed and carried no right to trial. Diderot might well have disappeared forever in the chateau\u2019s dungeon.\n\nBenefiting from the intervention of powerful friends, however, he was freed in November of that year, after more than 100 days of confinement. As part of his release deal, he signed a statement admitting that his writings were \u201cdebaucheries of the mind that escaped from me.\u201d He promised, \u201con my honor (and I do have honor) that they will be the last.\u201d For the most part, he kept his word. Although only in his mid-thirties at the time, he published little in the second half of his life. Instead, he set to work as editor of the most ambitious intellectual enterprise of the century.\n\nBefore his arrest, Diderot and his friend Jean le Rond d\u2019Alembert had hit on the idea of assembling a compendium of all human knowledge. Having secured printers to produce the work and subscribers to fund it, they now embarked on the \u201cSystematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts\u201d they called the Encyclopedia. The reign of dilettantes, obfuscating clerics, and secretive guilds was over, they insisted. This would be the work of experts and professionals, written for anyone who wished to know how the world operates.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe distributed the appropriate piece to each,\u201d Diderot boasted. \u201cMathematics to the mathematician; fortifications to the engineer; chemistry to the chemist\u2026 each person only what he understood.\u201d While many of the articles were dry and technical, the enterprise had an ideological aim from the start. The point of the Encyclopedia, Diderot wrote, was to ensure that \u201cthe work of centuries past is not useless to the centuries which follow, that our descendants, by becoming more learned, may become more virtuous and happier, and that we do not die without having merited being part of the human race.\u201d\n\nDiderot soon took over as chief editor and for more than two decades, between 1750 and the publication of the final volume in 1772, guided and sustained a publishing project that staggers the mind. The Encyclopedia ran to 28 large volumes, containing more than 70,000 entries and 3,000 illustrations. Approximately 150 writers contributed to the work, producing more than 20 million words in total. They included Diderot, d\u2019Alembert, Montesquieu, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Voltaire. The most prolific contributor was the Chevalier de Jaucourt, an aristocrat who had plenty of time on his hands and a stupendous work ethic. Between 1759 and 1765, with a team of researchers hired at his own expense, he wrote more than 17,000 articles, averaging about eight per day, equaling a quarter of the total word count.\n\nBetween 1759 and 1765, with a team of researchers hired at his own expense, he wrote more than 17,000 articles, averaging about eight per day.\n\nTo fulfill its ideological purpose, the Encyclopedia needed not only to explicate the most advanced knowledge of its time but also to encourage the attitudes that motivated these discoveries. It taught its readers to be bold, curious, iconoclastic, and independent. In doing so, it undercut much of the political culture and religious dogma of eighteenth-century France. The authorities stopped the project on two separate occasions, and Diderot lived in constant fear of arrest.\n\nHe \u201cengineered the dissemination of subversive ideas,\u201d as Curran puts it, through a series of brilliant and often hilarious stratagems. Most simply, he would sometimes commission an essay from a conservative thinker and then insert a passage of his own at the end that undercut the entire entry. In an article on the soul, for example, a Catholic apologist stated that the soul is the seat of reason, immaterial, immortal, and a separate substance from the body. After 17,000 words of tedious disquisition, the reader comes to a final note inserted by Diderot. Since the soul is separate from the body, it remains puzzling why a blow to the head affects one\u2019s reason.\n\nThe Encyclopedia also makes pitiless use of irony. The article on \u201cNoah\u2019s Ark\u201d offers a matter-of-fact discussion of what would be involved in building such a boat, populating it with animals, feeding them, and getting rid of their manure. Merely saying it shows its absurdity. By accepting dogmas at face value, the Encyclopedia mocks religious orthodoxy while appearing to honor it. Diderot\u2019s most ingenious device, however, was his use of cross-references. The Encyclopedia often gives a straight-forward entry on a topic only then to include cross-references to unrelated articles implying things that could never be said. The entry on \u201cCannibals,\u201d for instance, gives cross-references to \u201cCommunion\u201d and \u201cEucharist.\u201d\n\nFor all this cleverness, the Encyclopedia did fulfill its goal of transmitting the cutting edge of science, technology, and engineering around Europe, the Atlantic world, and eventually the globe. Its success was due in no small part to its illustrations. A team of artists under Diderot\u2019s direction spent years travelling everywhere from bakeries, hospitals, and iron foundries to military installations, pin factories, and shipyards. Their drawings were so accurate and detailed that a world-class technical school could be founded, or a nation\u2019s economy could be reconfigured, by acquiring a copy of the Encyclopedia. The demand was insatiable. By the early 1780s, nearly 25,000 sets had been printed and sold.\n\nWhile Diderot refrained from publishing anything controversial in his own name after his imprisonment, he continued to write. His most famous works today, aside from the Encyclopedia, were written to appear after his death. \u201cPosterity,\u201d he quipped, \u201cis for the philosopher what the next world is for the man of religion.\u201d The three most enduring of these, Rameau\u2019s Nephew, D\u2019Alembert\u2019s Dream, and Jacques the Fatalist, subject Diderot\u2019s philosophical views (primarily atheism and materialism) to the same skeptical interrogation that his earlier works employed against the teachings of the church. The books are astoundingly modern. Self-referential, occasionally self-contradictory, on the edge of spinning into nonsense, they give free rein to Diderot\u2019s whirligig of a mind. The narrator of Rameau\u2019s Nephew writes of himself: \u201cI give in to my mind\u2019s every fancy. I let it be my master and allow it to pursue the first idea that comes to it, good or mad.\u201d Curran calls this pattern of thought Diderot\u2019s \u201cmental libertinage.\u201d\n\nAs an original thinker, Diderot did not reach the level of Lucretius, Spinoza, or the other great philosophers whose ideas influenced his. Yet he excelled as a guide to philosophical concepts. In D\u2019Alembert\u2019s Dream, a fictionalized d\u2019Alembert challenges the materialism of a fictionalized Diderot. If a soul is not necessary for consciousness, d\u2019Alembert asks, why not say a stone can feel just as a human being does. \u201cWhy not?\u201d Diderot replies: Take a stone statue, grind it up, mix it into the soil, grow a crop, and eat it. The matter is conscious when it is part of a person. Why not say it was conscious when it was part of a statue? Diderot\u2019s vision of the universe as a vast expanse of combining and recombining matter led him to a host of original ideas. Perhaps, for example, hermaphroditism is the basic condition of animal life, from which male and female are deviants. Or, again, perhaps heterosexuality and homosexuality are not distinct categories but rather two extremes on a spectrum of desires. \u201cNothing that exists,\u201d he wrote, \u201ccan be against nature or outside of nature.\u201d\n\nWhile Diderot and Toinette had risked all to be together, their marriage was not especially happy. Diderot became a workaholic and was also unfaithful to her. Toinette developed a fearsome temper and was physically violent. In 1755, Diderot met the woman who would be the significant influence on the later part of his life\u2014a wealthy, brilliant, 38-year-old named Louise-Henriette Volland. He called her Sophie after the Greek word for wisdom. The 187 surviving letters that Diderot wrote to Sophie are treasures of eighteenth-century literature. One summer night in 1759, for example, he went to visit her but found that she was out or asleep and did not answer the door. In the pitch black, he took out a piece of paper and began to write.\n\nI am writing without being able to see.... I am writing you that I love you.\u2026 I am unable to leave. The hope of seeing you for a moment is holding me back, and I continue to speak to you without knowing if I am actually forming letters. Wherever you see nothing [on this page], read that I love you.\n\nDiderot\u2019s gift of expressing his thoughts and feelings as they were happening to him achieves its most gripping effects in these letters.\n\nAs he reached old age, Diderot did not suffer the fears or regrets that his Christian friends expected he would. He was happy to imagine that the matter of which he was composed would be returned to the earth and reconfigured into something new. In one of his most touching letters, he imagines that he and Sophie would be buried next to each other so that their \u201cashes might press and mix together and unite.\u201d He continues, \u201cMaybe they haven\u2019t lost all feeling or the memories of their earlier state\u2026. I could touch you, feel you, love you, look for you, unite myself with you, and combine myself with you when we are no longer.\u201d Curran says of this letter, \u201cDiderot\u2019s molecules scurry about in a quest for the carnal and intellectual joy that he had felt in an earlier life.\u201d\n\nThe man who had almost starved to death as a young layabout, spent his final days in a palatial Right Bank apartment supported by the Empress of Russia.\n\nDiderot and Toinette eventually reconciled, helping each other through serious illnesses late in life. By this time, they were a wealthy couple. The Encyclopedia had been an unprecedented success. Moreover, Catherine the Great, who admired the Encyclopedia and Diderot\u2019s freewheeling intellect, offered him an extraordinary gift. She would buy his library for 15,000 livres on the condition that he keep the books as long as he lived. Moreover, she would pay him 1,000 livres per year to take care of his books and would pay the first 50 years in advance. (He would be 102 before the next installment was due.) The man who had almost starved to death as a young layabout and been twice imprisoned, once by his father and again by the king, spent his final days in a palatial Right Bank apartment supported by the Empress of Russia.\n\n\n\nIn July of 1784, workmen arrived with a new bed for the elderly writer. As they labored to assemble it, Diderot told them, \u201cMy friends, you are giving yourself a lot of trouble for a piece of furniture that will only be used for four days.\u201d He died the next afternoon. Diderot was different than most philosophers from Plato to the present. He loved the things that make others uneasy: ambiguity, change, doubt, idiosyncrasy, spontaneity, and the pleasures of the flesh. When his own body expired, suddenly and peacefully, he was with Toinette at their luncheon table, enjoying a second helping of dessert."

    "text": "As climate change worsens, so does President Donald Trump\u2019s denial. On Sunday, The Washington Post reported that his administration is assembling a panel of fringe, industry-funded scientists who \u201crepresent the Trump administration\u2019s most forceful effort to date to challenge the scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are helping drive global warming and that the world could face dire consequences unless countries curb their carbon output over the next few decades.\u201d\n\nAs Trump denies, though, Democrats delay. On Friday, in an encounter caught on video, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein told a group of teenage and preteen climate activists that she won\u2019t support the Green New Deal, an ambitious plan to fight climate change introduced by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey earlier this month. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to pay for it,\u201d she said, referring to the plan\u2019s pledge to decarbonize the U.S. economy by the year 2030.\n\n\n\nThe children pleaded with Feinstein to be \u201cbrave\u201d and to think about their future. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who are going to be impacted,\u201d one girl pleaded. The 85-year-old insisted she understood, citing her seven grandchildren, but then dashed the schoolchildren\u2019s hopes. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the Senate for over a quarter of a century,\u201d she said, \u201cand I know what can pass and I know what can\u2019t pass.\u201d Later, Feinstein put out a statement calling climate change one of her top priorities and released a draft resolution of her alternative to the Green New Deal.\n\nThis is how @SenFeinstein reacted to children asking her to support the #GreenNewDeal resolution -- with smugness + disrespect.\n\n\n\nThis is a fight for our generation's survival. Her reaction is why young people desperately want new leadership in Congress. pic.twitter.com/0zAkaxruMI \u2014 Sunrise Movement \ud83c\udf05 (@sunrisemvmt) February 22, 2019\n\nFeinstein is not a climate villain on par with Trump. She has a 90 percent lifetime rating from the League of Conservation Voters, while Trump is withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris agreement and his EPA is methodically attempting to undo everything it accomplished under President Barack Obama. But the California senator is the bigger threat to the left\u2019s goal of slowing climate change before it\u2019s too late."

    "text": "This \u201cvalorization of violence\u201d is something that\u2019s targeted specifically at young men. Even the way clothes are displayed on far-right fashion websites, she says, promotes a hyper-masculine, violent image, with often heavily-tattooed, overly muscular men modeling the clothes. Miller-Idriss found that many of the young men she interviewed used a uniquely German word to describe the brands and the kinds of young men who wore them\u2014gewaltbereit, meaning ready for violence.\n\nOne way that the clothing socializes young men towards extremist thinking, according to Miller-Idriss, is through constant \u201cplayfulness\u201d and game-playing with symbols. Even in countries with lax or no laws against wearing Nazi imagery in public, it\u2019s still not the most socially acceptable thing to stroll around in public with a swastika t-shirt. But the same can\u2019t be said for lesser-known symbols commonly used by white nationalists and neo-Nazis, for example the runic insignia once used by the SS.\n\nThis game is on full display if you browse some of these brands\u2019 websites. One popular Ukrainian brand, Svastone\u2014owned by a musician in a neo-Nazi band\u2014features a logo that could be an oddly drawn diamond, or could be a truncated swastika. A popular Russian brand, White Rex\u2014founded by a notorious Russian neo-Nazi soccer hooligan\u2014sells a shirt with an array of bombs that, when you look more closely, form the number 88.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t see any swastikas or runes,\u201d White Rex founder Denis Nikitin told a Norwegian newspaper in 2017. \u201cThey should be clothes that people are comfortable wearing around town and so that they can recognize each other.\u201d\n\nThis kind of deliberate ambiguity\u2014a \u201cplayfulness of potential interpretations,\u201d Miller-Idriss calls it\u2014isn\u2019t just about skirting the lines between what\u2019s socially acceptable or legal. \u201cIt gives them a sense of power,\u201d says Miller-Idriss. \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand emotionally, that it\u2019s \u2018getting one over on the adults.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also, she said, \u201cone of multiple access points or gateways into far-right extremist scenes.\u201d\n\nFashion bleeds into many other activities of the far right. The Italian neo-fascist CasaPound movement has a clothing label that\u2019s been called the \u201ccommercial rib of CasaPound,\u201d helping finance some of its activities. Kiev-based Militant Zone not only sells t-shirts and CDs in a small shop just off the city\u2019s main square, but organized a neo-Nazi concert in December 2018 that featured \u201cSieg Heil\u201d chants and Hitler salutes.\n\nFar-right fashion can also cross over into far-right violence. White Rex owner Denis Nikitin\u2014also based in Kiev and working with the Azov movement\u2014hosts far-right-linked mixed martial arts events across Europe where he promotes his White Rex brand and its openly white supremacist message; he also reportedly uses income from the brand to fund far-right groups. Nikitin has also met with members of the California-based white supremacist gang Rise Above Movement, whose leaders were arrested in 2018, and allegedly helped train far-right extremists in the UK.\n\nWill far-right fashion catch on in the U.S. like it has in Europe? To go by the photos from some far-right rallies, it already has, at least to a limited extent. It\u2019s certainly not hard for an American to order clothing from many of these European brands or shops online. Nor is the American far-right lacking for any sense of uniform fashion, as the Proud Boys\u2019 co-opting of Fred Perry shirts make clear. And there\u2019s surely no doubt that the United States could be a huge untapped market for European far-right brands.\n\nU.S. far-right fashion culture, however, could prove both less subtle and harder to regulate.\n\nAmerican culture doesn\u2019t have the closetful of native extremist symbols that European far-right fashionistas have at their disposal. A number of symbols employed by Europe far-right fashion brands, Molnar explained, \u201chave been alternately used, embraced, tolerated, banned, later reconfigured and recycled by different regimes and have accumulated multiple layers of meaning.\u201d It gives them an ability to play coy with symbols, like runes appropriated by the SS. Aside from symbols like the Confederate flag or the Gadsden \u201cDon\u2019t tread on me\u201d flag, Molnar pointed out, there\u2019s no well the American far-right can reach into to pull out similarly ambiguous or repurposed icons. In short, American symbols are more explicit, requiring less \u201cdecoding\u201d to understand. The Klan hood is not exactly subtle. Instead, in the U.S., according to Miller-Idriss, most existing fashion that could be dubbed far right focuses on pro-veteran, pro-2nd-amendment and overtly Islamophobic themes.\n\nThe option often tried in Germany\u2014banning far-right clothing brands\u2014won\u2019t work in most public places due to American free speech protections. Insofar as U.S. schools want to try it, though, there\u2019s a pretty clear lesson from abroad: The bans on their own aren\u2019t effective. \u201cThey can even backfire and increase the appeal of the far-right by making clothing and symbols a space for easy rebellion and anti-authoritarian expression,\u201d Miller-Idriss said. What matters is the discussion: Many of the youth in Germany she interviewed where far-right brands like Thor Steinar were banned \u201cdid not understand why certain brands are banned\u201d; to them \u201cit just seemed like one more arbitrary rule to follow.\u201d U.S. educators, she said, \u201cneed to be clear with students and parents about what their thinking is about banning, what values are being defended and why.\u201d\n\nFailing to have that conversation cedes ground to the far right by default. For, whether it\u2019s a Ukrainian store selling a shirt with the SS\u2019s Totenkopf (death\u2019s head) and the logo of British neo-Nazi terror group Combat 18, or an Italian brand with a picture of a motorcycle and the words \u201cBORN TO WIN: WHITE RACE,\u201d or a Hungarian shirt with the words \u201cRise above democracy,\u201d the brains behind Europe\u2019s far-right fashion brands are perfectly clear about the kind of values they\u2019re defending."

    "text": "Why would Manafort implode a deal that would secure him a shorter prison sentence? Trump\u2019s implicit offer of pardons appears to have played a role. The Russia investigation always operated under this sword of Damocles. Presidential pardons don\u2019t affect state prosecutions, however, making the latter a fail-safe of sorts in case the president started to shut down Mueller\u2019s inquiry. The special counsel\u2019s office reportedly began working with the New York attorney general\u2019s office in the summer of 2017 on the financial-crimes portion of Manafort\u2019s case. Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. is also reportedly preparing to file charges against Manafort soon.\n\n\n\nTrump has been signaling his views on the pardon power for years. In August 2017, he pardoned former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was convicted of contempt of court for racially profiling Hispanic motorists despite a judge\u2019s order to desist. Last summer, Trump also wiped away conservative filmmaker Dinesh D\u2019Souza\u2019s conviction for campaign finance violations. Both men staunchly support the president and blamed politicized investigations for their downfall. While Trump isn\u2019t the first president to misuse the power of mercy, the two pardons made it unusually clear that he would wield pardons for purely partisan gain.\n\nAfter a Virginia jury convicted Manafort on multiple charges last August, Trump became even less subtle. The president publicly lauded his former campaign chairman for refusing to \u201cmake up stories in order to get a \u2018deal\u2019\u201d while harshly criticizing Michael Cohen, his former personal attorney, for cooperating with investigators. Hours later, Rudy Giuliani told reporters that the president wouldn\u2019t be issuing any pardons until the investigation had wrapped up. Taken together, the two messages suggested pardons would be on the table if their potential recipients kept quiet. The New York Times reported earlier this month that Trump\u2019s lawyers made similar assurances in private as well.\n\nThese efforts haven\u2019t gone unnoticed by the special counsel\u2019s office. In a sealed hearing earlier this month, Mueller\u2019s team offered two motives for why Manafort lied to them about part of the investigation. One of those motives is obscured by a thicket of partial redactions in the official transcript; the other is that telling the truth could have \u201cnegative consequences in terms of the other motive that Mr. Manafort could have, which is to at least augment his chances of a pardon.\u201d\n\nMost discussions of the Russia investigation center around the most important line of Mueller\u2019s inquiry: whether the Trump campaign illegally conspired with the Russian government during the 2016 election. But even if Mueller doesn\u2019t find evidence of this, his investigation has already proven its worth by uncovering a viper\u2019s nest of illegal conduct during the 2016 election. He shed light on how Russian operatives used social media networks to manipulate and influence public opinion. He uncovered suspicious contacts between Russian operatives and Trump campaign officials, and showed how they lied to keep those contacts hidden from the public. He also may have uncovered serious wrongdoing by the Trump Organization and the president\u2019s inaugural committee, both of which are now under investigation by federal prosecutors in New York and Washington."

A recent PRRI/The Atlantic survey found that 76 percent of Americans, including 81 percent of Republicans, believe the question will make the census inaccurate. Many experts, including the Census Bureau\u2019s career staff, fear that the question would measurably reduce participation among Hispanics and immigrants, and thus cause them to be underrepresented in the final data. The Trump administration\u2019s aggressive policies toward those communities has already made members of those communities reluctant to identify themselves to the government for other purposes. The shadow of history also looms large: Federal agents secretly used census data to locate and detain Japanese American families during World War II.\n\nSeventeen Democratic-led states and a coalition of immigrant rights groups sued last year to block the question. They argued that Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, violated the Administrative Procedures Act by ordering a citizenship question to be added in an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d manner. Ross initially said a citizenship question was necessary to help the Justice Department enforce part of the Voting Rights Act. Government records made public during the trial revealed, however, that the question was added by Ross\u2019s initiative over the objections of career officials who warned it would have dire implications for the census\u2019 accuracy.\n\nJudge Jesse Furman ruled against the Trump administration last month in a 220-page decision that excoriated the secretary of commerce. \u201c[Ross] failed to consider several important aspects of the problem; alternately ignored, cherry-picked, or badly misconstrued the evidence in the record before him; acted irrationally both in light of that evidence and his own stated decisional criteria; and failed to justify significant departures from past policies and practices\u2014a veritable smorgasbord of classic, clear-cut APA violations,\u201d he wrote.\n\nEven a modest undercounting would seriously warp census data for the next decade, depriving states and cities across the country of federal funds and political power. Relying on expert testimony, Furman found that California would almost certainly lose seats in Congress, and that Arizona, Florida, Illinois, New York, and Texas would risk losses as well if a citizenship question was added to the census. Since many states use federal data to reapportion their own legislatures every ten years, the impact would also be felt in state and local politics. \u201cThe addition of a citizenship question on the census will cause some jurisdictions and their residents to lose political power in that process as well,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIf the Supreme Court sides with Ross and the administration, its rulings in two other cases could compound that effect. Lamone v. Benisek and Rucho v. Common Cause both revolve around partisan gerrymandering. Multiple federal courts have ruled over the last decade that the practice can be unconstitutional in extreme circumstances. At the same time, the Supreme Court has declined to say whether partisan gerrymandering is unconstitutional or establish a test to determine when it goes too far. When the subject came before the justices last spring, they ultimately punted both cases in question back to the lower courts for further hearings."

    "text": "\u201cWhen push comes to shove, he is a supporter of a social democratic Scandinavian-style welfare state in the form of better education, healthcare and social service provisions for the general population rather than the confiscation of companies from the private sector,\u201d wrote Larry Liu in a prescient post in 2015 about the re-emergence of red-baiting.\n\n\n\nSanders has articulated his brand of democratic socialism as being about improving the lives of lower and middle-class Americans who have been left behind. \u201cWhen I use the word socialist\u2014and I know some people aren\u2019t comfortable about it\u2014I\u2019m saying that it is imperative\u2026 that we create a government that works for all and not just the few,\u201d he said in a 2015 speech articulating his political philosophy. \u201cI don\u2019t believe government should own the means of production, but I do believe that the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth of America deserve a fair deal.\u201d\n\n\n\nSanders\u2019s loss to Hillary Clinton could have quieted the questions about socialism\u2019s rise in America. Instead, Clinton lost to Trump, and Sanders\u2019s ideas gained even more traction on the left. So have the politics he represents. Since 2016, membership in the Democratic Socialists of America has increased from 6,000 to nearly 60,000. Today, nearly every major Democratic candidate embraces some form of universal health care, along with a host of other ambitious policies aimed at curbing inequality and climate change. Does that make them actual socialists, though?\n\n\n\nRepublicans think so, or at least want voters to think as much. They\u2019re returning to what has been a standard playbook for Republicans, beginning in the McCarthy era and continuing to this day. Over the last 80 years, as recently detailed by historian Kevin Kruse, everything from the polio vaccine to the interstate highway system to the Civil Rights Act have been labeled as \u201csocialism\u201d by opponents. Under President Obama, Republicans argued that bailout programs and providing market-based affordable health care were examples of a turn towards socialism. Trump, per usual, has taken his party\u2019s hyperbole to a new level: Embrace universal health care today, he warns, and end up like crumbling Venezuela tomorrow. There is no recognition of less extreme examples, like Britain\u2019s single-payer system or the successful democratic socialist economies of Nordic countries; socialism can only lead to economic collapse and authoritarianism.\n\n\n\nTrump: Socialism promises prosperity but it delivers poverty https://t.co/SNVjTXPOPb \u2014 Selylove (@hu06734367) February 22, 2019\n\nThese attacks from the right are being aided by many in the media, who are pressing Democratic candidates about their devotion to \u201csocialist\u201d positions. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar has built the early phase of her campaign around presenting herself as a sensible Democrat, out to improve social programs but not make them universal. This, in turn, has led The New York Times to frame the early stages of the Democratic primary as being a battle between \u201cpragmatism\u201d and \u201cideology.\u201d Senator Cory Booker, a co-sponsor of the Medicare for All bill, has taken to warning supporters that it will be difficult to pass. Harris, the only candidate besides Sanders to advocate for the abolition of private insurance, has said on the campaign trail that only parts of the Green New Deal will be able to become law. As The Washington Post reported earlier this week, candidates are \u201cbeing pressed from one side by core Democratic voters hungry for leftist policies favored by the most energized activists and, from the other, by the need to court centrist voters who could be alienated by the party\u2019s turn to the left.\u201d But they are also increasingly being pushed by members of the media to declare an allegiance between socialism and capitalism.\n\n"

    "text": "The Zarifs went to great lengths to protect the young Mohammad-Javad from the revolutionary political currents of the 1960s and 1970s. Neither newspapers nor television were to be found in the Zarif home, and the only radio receiver was locked up in a closet, to be used only by the elder Zarif to listen to morning prayers during the fasting month of Ramadan. The family gardener escorted the young Mohammad-Javad to the school bus, and he was not allowed to visit classmates at their homes.\n\nYet politics has a way of imposing itself upon Iranian families. In high school, socially isolated and friendless, Mohammad-Javad sought the company of books. He devoured \u201ctraditional and revolutionary books,\u201d including those of the fashionably radical writer Ali Shariati, whose Fatemeh Fatemeh Ast, or Fatimah is Fatimah, he secretly read and hid under the carpet in his room. This little pamphlet about one of the daughters of the Prophet Muhammad, and a wife of Ali, the first Imam of the Shia, was emblematic of Shariati\u2019s reinterpretation of the Shia faith as a revolutionary creed, with Fatimah as Joan of Arc. Zarif also secretly read a few books by the leftist author Samad Behrangi, whose children\u2019s stories were thinly camouflaged social criticism of the Pahlavi regime.\n\nZarif does not reveal what in these books ignited the revolutionary spark in him, or what other elements combined to make him militant. Instead he stresses his fear of being arrested, which allegedly was shared by his relatives, who urged him to travel abroad to avoid arrest. But reading Shariati and Behrangi hardly justified fear of arrest or imprisonment in late 1970s Iran. Zarif\u2019s explanation is implausible. The young Zarif\u2019s urge to rebel and to live abroad might well have been more personal than political. A deep attachment to his ailing mother, and bitter arguments with a domineering father, whose funeral in 1984 he did not attend, point in that direction.\n\nIn January 1977, with help from the friend of his father, the SAVAK agent, seventeen-year-old Mohammad-Javad avoided the draft and left Iran for the United States. He first enrolled at the Drew Preparatory School in San Francisco, and later at San Francisco State University, to study computer science. Here again politics intervened. \u201cFive to six months before the revolution,\u201d he recalls, \u201cI found these friends [Alavi School alumni turned revolutionary activists in the United States]. Maybe they found me.\u201d Zarif\u2019s ambiguity about who found whom probably shows that, rather than actively seeking the company of revolutionaries, he was recruited by the radicals. Outside the reach of his overprotective family and its always- surveilling family gardener, Zarif enthusiastically joined the \u201cfamily\u201d of Mostafa Chamran, who established the Muslim Students\u2019 Association at Berkeley. Here Zarif associated with Mohammad Hashemi Rafsanjani, Javad Larijani, Hossein Sheikh al-Eslam, Mohsen Nourbakhsh, and the notorious Saeed Emami, who would later become a deputy intelligence minister involved in, and probably scapegoated for, the infamous \u201cchain murders\u201d of Iranian dissidents in 1999. All of these men rose to prominence through the revolution.\n\nRemarkably, Zarif does not provide any account of the hectic days leading up to the revolution, which reinforces the impression that he was watching events unfold rather than driving them. Even after the fall of the Shah, unlike the hoards of half-educated Iranian students who returned home to serve the cause, Zarif remained in the United States. He was appointed the representative of Berkeley\u2019s Muslim Students\u2019 Association to the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco in order to \u201cprevent the consulate deviating from the path of the revolution.\u201d This he did until the closure of the consulate, leaving San Francisco only in the summer of 1979, when he returned to Tehran to marry a girl his sister had found for him.\n\nRevolutionary societies are more romantic when observed from abroad, and after just three weeks in Iran the young couple moved to New York, preferring Manhattan to the mayhem at home. As undesirable as revolutionary Tehran might have been, however, Manhattan, and America, did not seem attractive to the newlyweds. Apart from a single visit to a professor\u2019s home, where, out of fear of religious dietary restrictions, he did not touch anything but the salad, Zarif recalls that he never set foot in a residence of a non-Muslim American family in the course of more than twenty-four years in the United States. The couple seem to have shared a total disinterest in American society. Zarif admits that they \u201cnever learned the name of spices in English\u201d since they did not, either then or later, socialize with Americans.\n\nZarif is keen to let the reader know that, with the pardonable exception of cigars, he never fell victim to the moral temptations of the United States. It is an odd admission from a devout revolutionary Iranian. Male Iranian revolutionaries often want you to know, at least privately, that they have sampled Western delights. Sin, after all, gives credence to repentance, and to zealotry. Publicly professing abstention is not de rigueur inside the Islamic Republic\u2019s political system. Certainly Zarif expresses no revulsion from Western culture, and especially Western women, of the sort that the famous Sunni fundamentalist Sayyid Qutb did after a two-year sojourn in the United States. There is nothing in his book to match the embarrassed shock of young Khamenei, who\u2014camouflaged in Western clothing\u2014snuck into a cinema in Iran showing an American film and quickly fled in disgust. Zarif is not radically pious\u2014but there is a moral prudishness and social insecurity about him that blends into a devout Shia concern for purity. Mohammad Khatami, the former Iranian president, wrote a book called Bim-e Mowj, or Fear of the Wave, which is, among other things, a serious reflection on his fascination with the West, especially its leading seducer, the United States. But Zarif, who has spent more time in the United States than any other revolutionary VIP, offers next to nothing about his second home.\n\nAt the time of the seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran, which Zarif still calls \u201cthe Den of Espionage,\u201d he enrolled in the international relations program at Columbia University. Inspired by the Iraqi invasion of Iran, Zarif began studying the laws of war. By then, the skilled Shah-era diplomats at Iran\u2019s Permanent Mission to the United Nations had been purged and were replaced by informers and spies of the new regime, who did not speak English and, according to Zarif, had no idea what the United Nations was. They used their diplomatic credentials largely as cover for revolutionary work inside the United Nations and the United States. Owing to his network in San Francisco, his presence in New York, and his command of English, Zarif was given a position at the mission in May 1982. This was an important leap in his career. In his book, Zarif seeks to win sympathy from the reader for his purge by Ahmadinejad, but the fact is that his own rise through the revolutionary ranks was built on purges.\n\nZarif openly admits that he and his fellow revolutionaries were ill-prepared for diplomatic service. \u201cOn many occasions,\u201d he confesses, \u201cI have thought that the toll of the mistakes by me and the likes of me in the field of foreign policy was in reality paid by seventy million Iranians.\u201d The toll was great. For example, Ambassador Saeed Rajaei Khorasani, along with Zarif, boycotted the U. N. Security Council sessions that discussed the Iran-Iraq War. It was an unwise tactic, as Zarif today admits. He deplores the Islamic Republic\u2019s diplomacy of trial and error in the 1980s. He also doesn\u2019t seem too fond of his odd speeches at the U. N. Special Committee on Decolonization, which surely were not much different from President Ahmadinejad\u2019s vitriol before the General Assembly.\n\nApart from lacking the proper education for diplomatic service, Zarif also admits that he and other Iranian representatives at the Permanent Mission were kept in the dark by Tehran. \u201cThere were some who desired to continue the war until a specific point, and there were others who wanted to reach peace based on our conditions,\u201d Zarif writes. Yet he admits that \u201cin the United States, I was unaware of all this.\u201d Zarif\u2019s admission of ignorance may be just as valid today. He admits, for example, that he has never inspected his country\u2019s nuclear facilities. Previous negotiators of the Islamic Republic have disclosed (in private conversations with the authors of this article) that they were ignorant of the existence of the Fordow facility, which is burrowed into a mountain not far from the holy city of Qom. Even if Zarif negotiates in good faith in Geneva, how much does he really know about the strategy of the Supreme Leader and the Revolutionary Guards, who oversee all of Iran\u2019s nuclear sites?\n\nZarif\u2019s account of the Islamic Republic\u2019s post\u2013Iran-Iraq War diplomacy, in particular in the aftermath of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, will give some comfort to those who have tried so assiduously to see a hopeful evolution in Tehran\u2019s politics. But his discussion of the basic nature of the Islamic Republic and the West exposes Zarif\u2019s ideological commitment and the regime\u2019s revolutionary constancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have a fundamental problem with the West and especially with America,\u201d Zarif declares. \u201cThis is because we are claimants of a mission, which has a global dimension. It has nothing to do with the level of our strength, and is related to the source of our raison d\u2019\u00eatre. How come Malaysia [an overwhelmingly Muslim country] doesn\u2019t have similar problems? Because Malaysia is not trying to change the international order. It may seek independence and strength, but its definition of strength is the advancement of its national welfare.\u201d While Zarif considers national welfare one of the goals of the Islamic Republic, he stresses that \u201cwe have also defined a global vocation, both in the Constitution and in the ultimate objectives of the Islamic revolution.\u201d He adds: \u201cI believe that we do not exist without our revolutionary goals.\u201d\n\nZarif does not take the trouble to explain the global vocation of the Islamic Republic, but his reference to the Constitution is doubtlessly to Article 154: \u201c[the Islamic Republic] supports the just struggle of the mustazafun [the oppressed] against the mustakbirun [the arrogant] in every corner of the globe.\u201d This is the \u201cexport-of-the-revolution\u201d clause, which the late Grand Ayatollah Ali Montazeri, Khomeini\u2019s \u201cdefrocked\u201d onetime successor, who was perhaps the most Trotskyite of clerical revolutionaries, gingerly moved away from before he died under what was effectively house arrest. Very few others have even gone that far.\n\nAt times Zarif does not seem to recognize any conflict between ideology and national interests. \u201cFrom a theoretical point of view, I believe utopian interests can be aligned with national interests,\u201d he says, and cites Iraq and Lebanon as examples. \u201cInterests, which others considered utopian, allowed us to become an influential state in Iraq and Lebanon.\u201d But when the interviewer asks him about why the Islamic Republic does not support Chechen co-religionists against Christian Russians, Zarif refers to \u201ccertain considerations\u201d and stresses the primacy of national interests. Zarif further points at the Islamic Republic\u2019s relations with India and Pakistan; Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus; and Azerbaijan and Armenia, where the regime in Tehran sides with non-Muslims.\n\nThis might give the reassuring impression that for Zarif interests trump ideology, but a closer look at the foreign relations of the Islamic Republic explains the apparent inconsistency. Zarif does not really provide a review of his country\u2019s diplomatic history, but such a review would be instructive. The Islamic Republic has never demonstrated a great deal of interest in Muslim countries that are not on the front line of its struggle with the United States and Israel. Its fondness for revolutionary, or at least anti-American, non-Muslim states has always been much more pronounced than its efforts with Muslims who do not wish to be party to a \u201cclash of civilizations.\u201d Tehran has thrown a lot of money and \u201cdiplomatic\u201d personnel at anti-American Latin American states but relatively little at Sunni Indonesia, the largest Muslim country in the world. And after an initial euphoria in certain revolutionary quarters when the Soviet Union collapsed, Tehran quickly learned that it had relatively little traction among the Sunni Muslims of Central Asia. Jordanian missionaries with Saudi cash lived in miserable conditions to spread the word; Iranian \u201cdiplomats\u201d wanted the benighted Central Asians to come to them. When Tehran learned that the peoples of the post-Soviet Muslim territories no longer viewed Iran as the center of the world and were not particularly exercised about American imperialism, Central Asia became an economic zone of interest but not much more.\n\nThis brings us back to \u201cpragmatism,\u201d and to Zarif\u2019s fondness for Kissinger\u2019s dedication. Kissinger\u2019s true home is post-Napoleonic Europe where, ever so briefly, the \u201cbalance of power\u201d reigned supreme, and ideologies and religion no longer drove states to interfere in each other\u2019s domestic affairs. Metternich, who is Kissinger\u2019s iconic statesman, who squashed revolutionary movements wherever he could, is not a character Zarif could possibly admire. Although Zarif can certainly see the need to make tactical compromises in diplomacy, he makes it crystal clear that he sees national and religious concerns as indivisible. This point really shouldn\u2019t be difficult for Americans and Europeans to appreciate since they have been the trailblazers in globalizing their mores into \u201cuniversal human rights.\u201d Iran\u2019s first-generation revolutionaries, who drank deeply of Marxism, re-molding traditional Islamic tenets and heroes into religious dialectics about class struggle (often with a nasty anti-Semitic twist), have taken this moral universalism and made it their own.\n\nThey are undermined, of course, by the very success of the Western ideas that in part formed them. Individualism has sunk deeply into contemporary Iranian culture. It is impossible to read the Franco-Iranian scholar Farhad Khosrokhavar\u2019s captivating book Avoir vingt ans au pays des Ayatollahs, or To Be Twenty in the Land of the Ayatollahs, which is a long look at the children of senior clerics in Qom, without realizing that the Islamic revolution is in deep trouble. The children, especially the daughters, are profoundly Westernized, especially about matters of identity, love, and marriage. Zarif does not bother much with cultural reflection, but he certainly leads the reader to believe that he is not too keen on internal Iranian reform, culturally or politically. Zarif\u2019s fondness for hunar-e ta\u2019amul, or the art of dealing, in foreign affairs should not be construed domestically as an affection for cooperation within Iran\u2019s contentious and fractured society. It is worth noting that the Iranian police state hasn\u2019t become more polite under President Rouhani. (Under Khatami, at least for a few years, the oppression lightened.) It might have even become worse.\n\nAbove all else, Rouhani and Zarif aim to preserve the Islamic revolution, not to transform it, as was the passion of the fallen left-wing Islamist revolutionaries who gathered round Khatami and briefly resurfaced in the pro-democracy Green Movement, which Khamenei crushed in 2009. (Neither Rouhani nor Zarif raised a word against the brutal crackdown.) Although Khamenei unquestionably would have preferred Saeed Jalili to be president, he has probably lucked out with Rouhani. Rouhani at home and Zarif abroad are infinitely more effective at hunar-e ta\u2019amul. While Rouhani tries to re-weave the unity of the Iranian elite, badly frayed by the turmoil of 2009, and by Khamenei\u2019s vindictive demolition of Rafsanjani\u2019s political network, and by the anti-clerical populism of Ahmadinejad, Zarif is endeavoring to rebuild the Islamic Republic\u2019s standing beyond its borders. Given his soft manner, his wit, his reassuring English, and his ease with handshakes (difficult for many Iranian revolutionaries), and given the West\u2019s profound fear of another war in the Middle East, Zarif\u2019s biggest problem may be the Supreme Leader\u2019s habit of speaking the unvarnished truth.\n\nWhether Zarif succeeds or fails, it is certainly impressive that he has come so far inside Iran\u2019s Islamic regime. He has spent nearly half his life in the United States, the \u201cepicenter of evil.\u201d Many within the Revolutionary Guards who survived the ghastly battles of the Iran-Iraq War are not fond of him. They consider him a draft-dodger. Yet he is trusted enough by Khamenei to have been made foreign minister during the most trying times since 1988. An American who had spent almost a quarter of a century in Russia would never be cleared to work in Washington\u2019s national security establishment. And Iran\u2019s ruling elite is vastly more suspicious and conspiratorial than are Americans. That Zarif has risen certainly shows he has talent, where many of his colleagues have none. It also shows what Kissinger perhaps realized: that he is our enemy.\n\nAli Alfoneh is the author of Iran Unveiled: How the Revolutionary Guards Are Turning Theocracy into Military Dictatorship (AEI).

A teenage woman from Northern California began, \u201cThere were fires at my school.

It disorients, defies gravity, upends things and leaves them in a new place.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez gets much of the credit for bringing the Green New Deal into the mainstream. She visited Pelosi\u2019s office during the sit-in, and in the following weeks, her staff collaborated with Justice Democrats, the progressive electoral outfit started by veterans of the Bernie Sanders campaign, to draft a policy proposal for a GND. But the plan truly owes its swift rise to a grassroots climate organization called Sunrise Movement, launched a year and a half ago by twelve young organizers\u2014refugees from more mainstream climate organizations like Sierra Club and 350.org, and veterans of fossil fuel divestment and anti-pipeline campaigns."

It disorients, defies gravity, upends things and leaves them in a new place.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez gets much of the credit for bringing the Green New Deal into the mainstream. She visited Pelosi\u2019s office during the sit-in, and in the following weeks, her staff collaborated with Justice Democrats, the progressive electoral outfit started by veterans of the Bernie Sanders campaign, to draft a policy proposal for a GND. But the plan truly owes its swift rise to a grassroots climate organization called Sunrise Movement, launched a year and a half ago by twelve young organizers\u2014refugees from more mainstream climate organizations like Sierra Club and 350.org, and veterans of fossil fuel divestment and anti-pipeline campaigns."

    "text": "Which brings us to a risk unique to the twenty-first century: climate change. According to the 2018 report by the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, humanity has only 12 years left to prevent global warming from reaching levels that would result in the poverty of millions and the greatest displacement of people in the history of humanity as they flee extreme drought and floods. Such events also tend to involve violent conflict. The political community\u2019s tepid response to climate change so far, with world leaders like Donald Trump and Jair Bolsanaro refusing to acknowledge global warming as real, let alone as urgent, makes it hard to be optimistic. Given the very real possibility that life will be much worse for the next generation as a result of the global instability, some, recent trend pieces report, are thinking twice about becoming parents.\n\nOne might argue that, like Benatar\u2019s catalogue of human suffering, this response is overly pessimistic. Hardship is nothing new. Life can be meaningful despite it, and sometimes even because of it. Strife gives you something to work towards, purpose; it\u2019s what gives life meaning, not what makes it meaningless.\n\nBut if climate change causes wars to break out, would one still choose to birth children into a high likelihood of violent death? And if the looming 12-year deadline is missed, and further temperature increases become statistically inevitable, what purpose could life have in the face of an unavoidable, collective downfall? At least people living today still have the agency to change things. But bringing children into a decaying world, without even the opportunity to do something about it, seems a cruel fate to inflict on someone, especially your own child.\n\nThe great question is whether that fate is inevitable. During the Cold War, there was an existential fear about a possible nuclear war between America and the USSR, which would have brought about mass death and suffering. Instead, political history and fortune took a turn that made nuclear annihilation less likely\u2014even though the risk of a nuclear war may since have risen. Going further back, around the turn of the nineteenth century, the English economist Thomas Malthus was warning that the pending overpopulation of the planet would lead to inevitable food shortages. That didn\u2019t happen either. Technological advances have allowed the planet to feed a population many times its nineteenth-century tally of one billion. So, even if we can\u2019t see it from our current vantage point, there is hope that politics, technology, or a combination of the two might retrospectively render our current anxieties exaggerated. But, of course, there is no guarantee of that\u2014hope comes with its own risks.\n\nHaving children, some could argue, is a way of making that hope more realistic. While some environmentalists have suggested lowering birth rates to reduce greenhouse emissions for those who remain, there is also another side to the issue: Young people today care deeply about the environment and their activism is needed as political pressure. Young people will also be the future scientists and engineers that we need in order to come up with technological solutions to global warming that are still unavailable. Both these \u201cgreater good\u201d arguments for and against procreation, unfortunately, amount to using future children as a means to an end, thinking about how they can contribute to our overall welfare, rather than thinking of their own individual well-being."

    ],
    "text": "African-Americans make up 14 percent of the millennial population, born, roughly speaking, between 1981 and 1996. Black millennials came of age in the so-called post-race era, their worldview defined by Barack Obama\u2019s historic rise to the presidency, Beyonce\u2019s dominance of the entertainment industry, and Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s emergence as one of the premier public intellectuals in this country. But they also witnessed tragedies like the Rodney King beating, Hurricane Katrina, and the police shootings of Mike Brown and so many other young black men and women. They saw the horrific and racist treatment of our first black president and his wife. And then they saw the alleged \u201cpost-race\u201d period give way to the election of the most openly racist president in modern American history.\n\nThe black millennial, then, is composed of contradictions and ambiguity; her journey of tentative steps forward and horrific setbacks. In this, young blacks are not so different from their ancestors, complicating the whole notion of generational change that we are used to ascribing to non-black people, in which a particular cohort is perceived as being fundamentally different from its predecessors. In many ways, the story of the black millennial is as much about consistency as it is about change\u2014which is to say that the story of the black millennial is the story of what it means to be black, period.\n\nLike all millennials, black millennials have to deal with a host of economic challenges. In addition to middling wages and the burden of student debt, they have to negotiate a thriving gig economy that provides little security and an urban housing market that has increasingly priced out the working and middle classes. They are uncertain about the future in a way that past generations weren\u2019t, and grasping for an adulthood that feels forever delayed.\n\nBut though black millennials have much in common with their white peers, there are important distinctions. In almost all areas of life, the deck is stacked even higher against us, in part due to historical discrimination and in part because of inequities unique to the millennial era. By many measures, black millennials are behind. We lag in terms of employment, wages, and attaining \u201cgood jobs.\u201d We have less wealth, live in poverty more. Even when we try to do something positive like go to college, we have to take on higher amounts of student debt. And then we still end up with fewer job prospects than our white counterparts.\n\nAs an older millennial, I saw my black friends working harder than ever and going to graduate school\u2014and still taking on multiple jobs. Meanwhile, my white peers regaled me with tales of miraculously landing great positions and getting into fantastic schools with mediocre test scores. They told me about promotions, about just being in the right place at the right time. They struggled less, made more money, and had all the luck. It made me angry.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the economic situation. Black millennials are increasingly asked for their ID when voting. We are still disproportionately being sucked into the criminal justice system. We have less access to health care, and are likely to die at a younger age. We have to dress a certain way so we aren\u2019t stopped by police at night. We are mocked for the way we look and disparaged for being angry and loud. Our sexuality, always expressed as something animalistic and promiscuous, is often still the subject of public indignation. Even the wealthiest, most successful black millennials can\u2019t protest peacefully without being called ungrateful and unpatriotic.\n\nEven the wealthiest, most successful black millennials can\u2019t protest peacefully without being called ungrateful and unpatriotic.\n\nThe great irony of all this\u2014and perhaps what truly makes black millennials distinct from their forebears\u2014is that we\u2019re supposed to believe that the playing field has finally evened out. Many people, including older blacks at times, just don\u2019t understand why young black millennials are frustrated. They think because we aren\u2019t being threatened by the Klan every day, that, if we point out racism, we are playing the \u201crace card,\u201d indulging in identity politics, playing the victim, and simply not working hard enough. Martin Luther King Jr., once dubbed the \u201cmost dangerous negro,\u201d has a national holiday in his honor; explicit segregation and overt discrimination are universally condemned (but nevertheless ubiquitous); Black Panther destroyed the box office last year; and heck, we had a black president.\n\nObama looms large over this generation, a symbol less of progress than of the fundamental ambivalence of being a black millennial. \u201cI specifically remember the day I watched Barack Obama get inaugurated into office,\u201d Patrick, a 28-year-old graduate of Howard University, told me. \u201cMy mind was like, maybe we are in a post-racial society. People elected a black person.\u201d But he slowly began to understand that in this country there is always a qualifier to progress. \u201cWe\u2019re realizing more and more that whatever happens, whatever benefits that we get, there\u2019s always a \u2018but\u2019 to it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s always something that comes after that makes it almost not worth it. So, yes, we had a black president, but now we have a racist white president.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not living in a post-racial society,\u201d Patrick added. \u201cWe just elected a black president. That\u2019s all we did.\u201d\n\nI spoke to dozens of black millennials who echoed Patrick\u2019s experiences.\n\nThere was Jeremy, a coal miner from West Virginia, who had to overcome the perception that the industry was for whites only. \u201cIt was hard on me at first,\u201d he said. \u201cI was called the N-word when I started working underground, people not talking to you, just walking by you like you\u2019re invisible. They put people in a category. If you\u2019re black, there\u2019s nothing good about you\u2014especially if you\u2019re black and taking a white person\u2019s position, where another white person could be. They just don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s Trina, from Jackson, Mississippi, a mother of three who says black women are constantly held to different standards. \u201cSociety makes it harder on us for everything,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we have six kids we look like we got no morals. We just have sex with anybody. If a white woman got six kids, \u2018Oh she\u2019s probably just doing the Lord\u2019s will. He says be fruitful and multiply.\u2019 Black women, we got colored hair, we ghetto. White women, they got colored hair they\u2019re cultural. We get braids, oh we pro-black. White women braid their hair, \u2018Oh they\u2019re just diverse.\u2019 There\u2019s a double standard.\u201d\n\nJalessa, who worked in communications for a major company in Los Angeles, said that the idea that blacks have to work twice as hard is very real. \u201cBlack people gotta prove so much before our opinion can be valued,\u201d she said, \u201cwhereas a white man could walk into a room and he could just come out and say what he wants, negotiate with who he wants.\u201d She added, \u201cLet me come in and have a bad day. I\u2019m supposed to suck it up, smile and not be the black girl with the attitude.\u201d\n\nTo understand the black millennial, then, is to not only reverse the tired tropes about millennials that have proliferated in the media for the past ten or so years\u2014it is also to rethink the role of race in twenty-first century America. Despite the increased acceptance of interracial relationships, a widespread love of black culture, and a more visible presence for blacks in historically white institutions, it\u2019s still hard to overstate just how much the past remains present in this country. Research conducted by The Washington Post in 2015 about the supposedly \u201cwoke\u201d millennial generation found that 31 percent of white millennials think blacks are lazier than whites, and that 23 percent say they\u2019re not as intelligent. Shocking responses, and statistically not much different from those in previous generations.\n\nIf it is the case that black millennials are stuck in a cyclical experience that transcends history, then some will ask why the experience of the missing black millennial, in particular, matters. They will say this is essentially the same story that black people have suffered for decades, and to some degree they will be right. Promise and decline, hope and suffering\u2014it is a pattern that weaves together Reconstruction, the Great Migration, the Civil Rights movement, and the election of Barack Obama. Throughout it all, the black community has waited for America to finally make good on its promise. Yet that day hasn\u2019t come.\n\nTo comprehend the black millennial experience in America is to comprehend what it means to hope.\n\nTo comprehend the black millennial experience in America is to comprehend what it means to hope. Not in a feel-good way, not in a naive way, but in a desperate way, as a way of life, because the alternative is unacceptable. This is the story of black America, a story of strength and overcoming. But I sometimes wonder: When do we give up? When will hope fade? I am reminded constantly that, despite the hope of a black president, it was under his watch that the movement for black lives started. And it\u2019s in his shadow that a racist president exists.\n\nIn a 1965 piece for The New York Times, James Baldwin talked about the painful generational trap that blacks face, a trap that black millennials are starting to confront as the older among us approach our forties:\n\nYou realize that you are 30 and you are having a terrible time. You have been through a certain kind of mill and the most serious effect is again not the catalogue of disaster\u2014the policeman, the taxi driver, the waiters, the landlady, the banks, the insurance companies, the millions of details 24 hours of every day which spell out to you that you are a worthless human being. It is not that. By that time you have begun to see it happening in your daughter, your son or your niece or your nephew. You are 30 by now and nothing you have done has helped you escape the trap. But what is worse is that nothing you have done, and as far as you can tell nothing you can do, will save your son or your daughter from having the same disaster and from coming to the same end.\n\n\n\nYet we continue to hope, we continue to struggle. Study after study shows that, despite being left behind, black millennials are still optimistic. But the nature of that struggle has changed, especially when it comes to the kind of freedom black millennials desire. A new crop of African American politicians, for example, have refused to whitewash their political personas, demanding that voters accept the ways in which they are different. Mayor Frank Scott Jr. of Little Rock, Arkansas, has said he is \u201cunapologetically black.\u201d Park Cannon, who was elected to the Georgia House in 2016, is one of that legislature\u2019s three queer representatives and openly supports Black Lives Matter. Similarly audacious themes have cropped up in the 2018 campaigns of Gen Xers like Stacey Abrams, Ayanna Pressley, and Andrew Gillum.\n\nBlack millennials, like others in their generation, are frustrated with the current system. Participation among black millennials in presidential elections dropped between 2012 and 2016, according to Pew, with turnout at 55 percent and 51 percent, respectively. That could partly be attributed to Obama no longer leading the Democratic ticket. But black millennials also supported Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primary, while their parents went for Hillary Clinton, an indication that young blacks are disillusioned with the establishment and hungry for the kind of economic freedom promised in Sanders\u2019s more far-reaching platform.\n\nPerhaps young blacks are guilty of being that most unforgivable of millennial sins: entitled. But our sense of entitlement does not revolve around avocado toast and CBD lattes. Our sense of entitlement, or at least mine specifically, comes from the notion that the richest nation on earth can provide all of its citizens with basic necessities. I thought that, if we worked hard, we could have an affordable home, decent health care, and a modest feeling of security. I thought that we were supposed to be able to have families without paying out the nose for daycare or worrying about student loans. And I thought that, after 400 years in this country, black people wouldn\u2019t have to remind the world that our lives matter. But I was wrong.\n\nBlack America is not a monolith. We don\u2019t all agree on what blackness or Americanness means, or whether we should even reconcile those two things. But we all have our own stories, and those stories are crucial to understanding the experience of black millennials and what that experience says about our country.\n\nBuzzFeed, for example, recently published a story that addressed black millennial burnout. However, the piece was a response to another article about millennial burnout that went viral and that was very rooted in white experience. Though the response was a beautifully crafted evocation of black trauma and suffering, it reminded me that all too often our pain is seen as a side issue\u2014an addendum to, instead of a legitimate part of, mainstream experience. And only one author ended up on the Today Show talking about millennials. Guess which?\n\nIf we were to put those stories front and center, we would find a version of young black America that is no less profound for being different\u2014for being far from \u201ctypical.\u201d My conversation with a young artist Shamir comes to mind. He had a breakout album in 2015, but years later found that he was being pushed in a direction he didn\u2019t like. So he gave up the fancy producers and set out to define his career in a way that departed from what was expected of a black musician, recording a lo-fi album alone in his Philadelphia bedroom. He found the experience to be liberating. \u201cI\u2019ve already reached my American Dream,\u201d he told me. \u201cI have this career that feels boundless now.... It can only go up from there. I know there\u2019s still a lot of other things that I want to do, but they don\u2019t feel out of reach.\u201d\n\n"

    "text": "Easterbrook goes on: \u201cWhen the original meaning is lost in the passage of time\u2026the justification for judges\u2019 having the last word evaporates.\u201d This is a version of the doctrine of judicial self-restraint, which Scalia and Garner endorse by saying that a statute\u2019s unconstitutionality must be \u201cclearly shown\u201d\u2014which it was not in Heller. Justice Scalia\u2019s interpretation of the Second Amendment probably is erroneous, but one who doubts this should conclude that the relevant meaning of the amendment had been \u201clost in the passage of time,\u201d and so the Court should have let the District of Columbia\u2019s gun ordinance stand.\n\nHeller probably is the best-known and the most heavily criticized of Justice Scalia\u2019s opinions. Reading Law is Scalia\u2019s response to the criticism. It is unconvincing.\n\nSCALIA AND GARNER contend that textual originalism was the dominant American method of judicial interpretation until the middle of the twentieth century. The only evidence they provide, however, consists of quotations from judges and jurists, such as William Blackstone, John Marshall, and Oliver Wendell Holmes, who wrote before 1950. Yet none of those illuminati, while respectful of statutory and constitutional text, as any responsible lawyer would be, was a textual originalist. All were, famously, \u201cloose constructionists.\u201d\n\nScalia and Garner call Blackstone \u201ca thoroughgoing originalist.\u201d They say that \u201cBlackstone made it very clear that original meaning governed.\u201d Yet they quote in support the famous statement in his Commentaries on the Laws of England that \u201cthe fairest and most rational method to interpret the will of the legislator, is by exploring his intentions at the time when the law made, by signs the most natural and probable. And these signs are either the words, the context, the subject matter, the effects and consequence, or the spirit and reason of the law\u201d (emphasis mine, except that the first \u201csigns\u201d is emphasized in the original). Blackstone adds that \u201cthe most universal and effectual way of discovering the true meaning of a law, when the words are dubious, is by considering the reason and spirit of it; or the cause which moved the legislator to enact it.\u201d\n\nIt is possible to glean from judges who actually are loose constructionists the occasional paean to textualism, but it is na\u00efve to think that judges believe everything they say, especially when speaking ex cathedra (that is, in their judicial opinions). Judges tend to deny the creative\u2014the legislative\u2014dimension of judging, important as it is in our system, because they do not want to give the impression that they are competing with legislators, or engaged in anything but the politically unthreatening activity of objective, literal-minded interpretation, using arcane tools of legal analysis. The fact that loose constructionists sometimes publicly endorse textualism is evidence only that judges are, for strategic reasons, often not candid.\n\nIt is a singular embarrassment for textual originalists that the most esteemed judicial opinion in American history, Brown v. Board of Education, is nonoriginalist. In 1868, when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, the provision that states not deny to any person the \u201cequal protection of the laws\u201d meant that states\u2014the former states of the Confederacy being the particular concern, of course\u2014must not deny legal protection to the newly freed slaves (and to blacks more generally). In particular, states could not, without facing legal consequences, turn a blind eye to the Ku Klux Klan\u2019s campaign of intimidation of blacks and carpetbaggers. Had the provision been thought, in 1868, to forbid racial segregation of public schools, it would not have been ratified. Yet Scalia and Garner claim that \u201crecent research persuasively establishes that [the ruling in Brown that separate but equal is not equal] was the original understanding of the post-Civil War Amendments,\u201d citing for this proposition a single law review article published seventeen years ago. They do not mention the powerful criticism of that article by Michael Klarman, a leading legal historian\u2014which the author of the article they cite, Michael McConnell, is not, although he is a distinguished constitutional law professor and a former federal judge. And, ironically, McConnell based his analysis on the legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment, which should be anathema to Scalia.\n\nSimilarly, the book\u2019s defense of the Heller decision fails to mention that most professional historians reject the historical analysis in Scalia\u2019s opinion. Reading Law quotes approvingly Joseph Story\u2019s analysis of preambles\u2014\u201cthe preamble of a statute is a key to open the mind of the makers, as to the mischiefs, which are to be remedied, and the objects, which are to be accomplished by the provisions of the statute\u201d\u2014but fails to apply the analysis to the preamble of the Second Amendment, which reads: \u201cA well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State.\u201d The preamble implies that the Second Amendment (which creates a right \u201cto keep and bear arms\u201d) is not about personal self-defense, but about forbidding the federal government to disarm state militias. Contra Story, Justice Scalia treated the preamble dismissively in his opinion in Heller.\n\nOMITTING CONTRARY evidence turns out to be Scalia and Garner\u2019s favorite rhetorical device. Repeatedly they cite cases (both state and federal) as exemplars either of textual originalism or of a disreputable rejection of it, while ignoring critical passages that show the judges neither ignoring text nor tethered to textual originalism. Thus they applaud White City Shopping Center, LP v. PR Restaurants, LLC, a decision that held that the word \u201csandwiches\u201d in a lease did not include burritos, tacos, or quesadillas, because Merriam-Webster\u2019s dictionary defines \u201csandwich\u201d as \u201ctwo thin pieces of bread, usually buttered, with a thin layer (as of meat, cheese, or savory mixture) spread between them.\u201d Scalia and Garner stop there, as if that dictionary reference were the court\u2019s entire decision, thus confirming the use of the dictionary as a guide to the meaning of legal documents. But the court had not stopped with the dictionary.\n\nA company called PR had leased space to operate a sandwich shop in a shopping center. Its lease forbade the shopping center to lease space to another store if more than ten percent of the new store\u2019s sales would be of sandwiches. PR claimed that the shopping center violated the lease when it leased space to a Mexican-style restaurant that planned to sell burritos, tacos, and quesadillas. After noting Merriam-Webster\u2019s definition of sandwich, the court made a series of points in support of its decision against PR that were unrelated to dictionary definitions: \u201cPR has not proffered any evidence that the parties intended the term \u2018sandwiches\u2019 to include burritos, tacos, and quesadillas. As the drafter of the exclusivity clause, PR did not include a definition of \u2018sandwiches\u2019 in the lease nor communicate clearly to White City during lease negotiations that it intended to treat burritos, tacos, quesadillas, and sandwiches the same. [PR] was aware that Mexican-style restaurants near the Shopping Center existed which sold burritos, tacos, and quesadillas prior to the execution of the Lease yet, PR made no attempt to define, discuss, and clarify the parties\u2019 understanding of the term \u2018sandwiches.\u2019\u201d\n\nThose are more persuasive points than the dictionary\u2019s definition, and as is often the case, the court got the definition wrong. (Scalia and Garner miss this, too.) A sandwich does not have to have two slices of bread; it can have more than two (a club sandwich) and it can have just one (an open-faced sandwich). The slices of bread do not have to be thin, and the layer between them does not have to be thin either. The slices do not have to be slices of bread: a hamburger is regarded as a sandwich, and also a hot dog\u2014and some people regard tacos and burritos as sandwiches, and a quesadilla is even more sandwich-like. Dictionaries are mazes in which judges are soon lost. A dictionary-centered textualism is hopeless.\n\nYet in further obeisance to the dictionary Scalia and Garner commend a court for having ordered the acquittal of a person who had fired a gun inside a building and been charged with the crime of shooting \u201cfrom any location into any occupied structure.\u201d They say that the court correctly decided the case (Commonwealth v. McCoy) on the basis of the dictionary definition of \u201cinto.\u201d They misread the court\u2019s opinion. The opinion calls the entire expression \u201cfrom any location into any occupied structure\u201d ambiguous: while \u201cinto\u201d implies that the shooter was outside, \u201cfrom any location\u201d implies that he could be anywhere, and therefore inside. The court went on to decide the case on other grounds.\n\nScalia and Garner ridicule a decision by the Supreme Court of Kansas (State ex rel. Miller v. Claiborne)that held that cockfighting did not violate the state\u2019s law against cruelty to animals. They say that the court, in defiance of the dictionary, \u201cperversely held that roosters are not \u2018animals.\u2019\u201d When I read this, I found it hard to believe that a court would hold that roosters are not animals, so I looked up the case. I discovered that the court had not held that roosters are not animals. It was then that I started reading the other cases cited by Scalia and Garner.\n\nIn fact, the court said that \u201cbiologically speaking a fowl is an animal,\u201d but that it was not in the class of animals protected by the statute. The court gave a number of reasons for this conclusion\u2014all ignored by Scalia and Garner. One, which was in fact textual originalist, was that \u201cpersons of common intelligence\u201d conceived of chickens as birds in contradistinction to animals. But the most cogent reason for the court\u2019s result was that the legislature had passed a statute forbidding cockfighting on Sundays, which implied that it was permissible the rest of the week, and had later repealed the statute, implying that cockfighting was again permissible on any day of the week\u2014and in fact cockfighting was an open and notorious sport in Kansas (to the surprise and disgust of the judges).\n\nScalia and Garner denounce a court that held, in a case called Braschi v. Stahl Associates Co., that the word \u201cfamily\u201d in a New York rent-control statute that prohibited a landlord from dispossessing a \u201cmember of the deceased tenant\u2019s family who has been living with the tenant\u201d included \u201ca cohabiting nonrelative who had an emotional commitment to the deceased tenant.\u201d The word \u201cfamily\u201d was undefined in the statute. The case may be right or wrong; what is disturbing is Scalia and Garner\u2019s failure to mention that it was a homosexual couple at a time when homosexual marriage was not recognized in New York, and that the opinion states that the two men had been living together just like spouses and had been accepted as such by their families.\n\nScalia and Garner applaud a decision (State by Cooper v. French) holding that a refusal to rent a house to an unmarried heterosexual couple did not violate a statute forbidding discrimination in rentals on grounds of \u201cmarital status,\u201d a term not defined in the statute. The court relied for this conclusion on another statute, one forbidding fornication. One may doubt whether that statute was the actual motivator of the decision, given the statement in the majority opinion\u2014remarkable for 1990\u2014that \u201cit is simply astonishing to me that the argument is made that the legislature intended to protect fornication and promote a lifestyle which corrodes the institutions which have sustained our civilization, namely, marriage and family life.\u201d This statement is not quoted by Scalia and Garner. (And two sentences later the judge referred, contrary to a Scalia-Garner Diktat, to the statute\u2019s legislative history.)\n\nAfter the refusal to rent, but before the court\u2019s decision, the anti-discrimination law had been amended to define \u201cmarital status\u201d as \u201cwhether a person is single, married, remarried, divorced, separated, or a surviving spouse\u201d; and the man and woman who had wanted to rent were both single, a protected marital status under the amended statute. On the page following their discussion of the case, Scalia and Garner, having moved on to another case, remark that \u201cthe meaning of an ambiguous provision may change in light of a subsequent enactment \u2026 unless the ambiguous provision had already been given an authoritative judicial interpretation.\u201d The original provision\u2014 \u201cmarital status\u201d\u2014had been undefined and therefore ambiguous, and had not been given an authoritative judicial interpretation. So the amendment, which broadened statutory protection to unmarried persons, provided some basis (though far from conclusive), consistent with textual originalism as understood by Scalia and Garner, for the court\u2019s decision that they denounce. They do not mention this possibility.\n\nScalia and Garner are capable of reveling in absurdity. A provision of federal immigration law allowed the wife of a naturalized American citizen to be admitted to the United States for treatment in a hospital without being detained as an alien. The non-citizen wife of a native-born (as distinct from naturalized) American citizen was denied entry for treatment, and the Supreme Court upheld the denial in Chung Fook v. White. Scalia and Garner applaud the result, which gave more rights to the wife of a naturalized citizen than to the wife of a native-born citizen, while calling it \u201cadmittedly absurd.\u201d They recognize a doctrine of \u201cabsurdity\u201d that permits interpretive deviations from literal readings that produce ludicrous results, but they declare the doctrine inapplicable in this case because a provision relating to native-born Americans would be out of place in an immigration statute, which is about aliens\u2014yet the citizen\u2019s wife whose right of entry was in question was an alien.\n\nThey fail to mention that the Supreme Court appears to have agreed with the sensible alternative interpretation of the statute that the court of appeals had adopted. The statute by its terms applied only if the marriage had taken place after the husband was naturalized, and was therefore limited to cases in which the wife had become an American citizen as a result of the marriage even though she was living abroad; the immigration law provided that \u201cany woman who is now or may hereafter be married to a citizen of the United States, and who might herself be lawfully naturalized, shall be deemed a citizen.\u201d In the Chung Fook case, however, because the wife was Chinese, she could not, as the law then stood, become an American citizen despite being married to a native-born American. If, therefore, as the court of appeals held, the right of entry was limited to citizen wives, Chung Fook was not a beneficiary of the statute allowing entry. The Supreme Court said that it was \u201cinclined to agree with [the] view\u201d of the court of appeals, which saved the statute from absurdity (though not from offensiveness)\u2014the view that the statute rested on the different status of citizen and non-citizen wives rather than of native-born and naturalized citizens. It was only after stating its inclination to agree with the court of appeals\u2019 sensible interpretation that the Court embraced, it seems reluctantly, the alternative ground that the right of entry without detention did not apply to wives of native-born Americans. One wonders whether the Court would have embraced an obviously unintended statutory distinction between citizen wives of native-born and of naturalized American citizens to the disadvantage of the former, if to do so would have affected the outcome.\n\nTHERE IS A COMMON THREAD to the cases that Scalia and Garner discuss. Judges discuss the meanings of words and sometimes look for those meanings in dictionaries. But judges who consult dictionaries also consider the range of commonsensical but non-textual clues to meaning that come naturally to readers trying to solve an interpretive puzzle. How many readers of Scalia and Garner\u2019s massive tome will do what I have done\u2014read the opinions cited in their footnotes and discover that in discussing the opinions they give distorted impressions of how judges actually interpret legal texts?\n\nAnother problem with their defense of textual originalism is their disingenuous characterization of other interpretive theories, typified by their statement that textual originalism is the only \u201cobjective standard of interpretation even competing for acceptance. Nonoriginalism is not an interpretive theory\u2014it is nothing more than a repudiation of originalism, leaving open the question: How does a judge determine when and how the meaning of a text has changed? To this question the nonoriginalists have no answer\u2014or rather no answer that comes even close to being an objective test.\u201d But \u201cnon-originalism\u201d is not the name of an alternative method of interpretation. It is just a bogeyman, like what they call \u201cso-called consequentialism\u201d\u2014\u201cis this decision good for the little guy?\u201d\n\nA problem that undermines their entire approach is the authors\u2019 lack of a consistent commitment to textual originalism. They endorse fifty-seven \u201ccanons of construction,\u201d or interpretive principles, and in their variety and frequent ambiguity these \u201ccanons\u201d provide them with all the room needed to generate the outcome that favors Justice Scalia\u2019s strongly felt views on such matters as abortion, homosexuality, illegal immigration, states\u2019 rights, the death penalty, and guns.\n\nThus they declare that \u201ca fair system of laws requires precision in the definition of offenses and punishments,\u201d implying that judges are entitled to use a concept of \u201cfairness\u201d to interpret statutes creating offenses and punishments. How is that to be squared with textual originalism? They say that \u201ctextualism, in its purest form, begins and ends with what the text says and fairly implies\u201d (emphasis added), but evidently Scalia and Garner are not committed to its \u201cpurest form,\u201d for they say that \u201cdetermining what is reasonably implied [by the words of a statute] takes some judgment\u201d (emphasis in original). They endorse the \u201crule of lenity\u201d\u2014the interpretive principle that ambiguity in criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of the criminal defendant\u2014without showing how it can be consistent with textual originalism.\n\nThey assert that what they call \u201cfair reading\u201d requires \u201can ability to comprehend the purpose of the text, which is a vital part of its context,\u201d and though they add that \u201cthe purpose is to be gathered only from the text itself, consistently with the other aspects of its context,\u201d they also say that \u201ca sign at the entrance to a butcher shop reading \u2018No dogs or other animals\u2019 does not mean that only canines, or only four-legged animals, or only domestic animals are excluded.\u201d That is certainly right, but it is not right by virtue of anything textual. It is right by virtue of the principle that meaning includes what \u201cwould come into the reasonable person\u2019s mind,\u201d or what we know an author has \u201cin mind\u201d in writing something. On such grounds (which surprisingly the authors embrace as well) a sign that says \u201cNo dogs, cats, and other animals allowed\u201d must be read to include totally unrelated animals (contrary to the principle of eiusdem generis\u2014the \u201ccanon,\u201d which they also approve, that a last general term in a series is assumed to be of the same type as the earlier, specific terms) because \u201cno one would think that only domestic pets were excluded, and that farm animals or wild animals were welcome.\u201d Right again! But right because textualism is wrong. Similarly, although a human being is an animal, a sign forbidding animals in a restaurant should not be interpreted to ban humans from the restaurant. It is the purpose of the sign, not anything in the sign, that tells you what meaning to attach to the word \u201canimals\u201d among its possible meanings.\n\nANOTHER interpretive principle that Scalia and Garner approve is the presumption against the implied repeal of state statutes by federal statutes. They base this \u201con an assumption of what Congress, in our federal system, would or should normally desire.\u201d What Congress would desire? What Congress should desire? Is this textualism, too?\n\nAnd remember the ambulance case? Having said that the conclusion that an ambulance was forbidden to enter the park even to save a person\u2019s life was entailed by textual originalism and therefore correct, Scalia and Garner remark several hundred pages later that the entry of the ambulance is not prohibited after all, owing to the \u201ccommon-law defense of necessity,\u201d which they allow to override statutory text. Yet just four pages later they say that except in \u201cselect fields such as admiralty law, [federal courts] have no significant common-law powers.\u201d And still elsewhere, tacking back again, they refer approvingly to an opinion by Justice Kennedy (Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc.), which states that \u201cthe Sherman Act\u2019s use of \u2018restraint of trade\u2019 invokes the common law itself ... not merely the static content that the common law had assigned to the term in 1890.\u201d In other words, \u201crestraint of trade\u201d had a specific meaning (and it did: it meant \u201crestraints on alienation\u201d) in 1890 that judges are free to alter in conformity with modern economics\u2014a form of \u201cdynamic\u201d interpretation that should be anathema to Scalia and Garner. A few pages later they say that \u201cfederal courts do not possess the lawmaking power of common-law courts,\u201d ignoring not only the antitrust and ambulance cases but also the fact that most of the concepts deployed in federal criminal law\u2014such as mens rea (intent), conspiracy, attempt, self-defense, and necessity\u2014are common law concepts left undefined in criminal statutes.\n\nScalia and Garner indicate their agreement with a number of old cases that hold that an heir who murders his parents or others from whom he expects to inherit is not disqualified from inheriting despite the common law maxim that no person shall be permitted to profit from his wrongful act. (Notice how common law floats in and out of their analysis, unpredictably.) They say that these cases are \u201ctextually correct\u201d though awful, and are happy to note that they have been overruled by statute. Yet just before registering their approval they had applauded the rule that allows the deadlines in statutes of limitations to be \u201ctolled\u201d (delayed) \u201cbecause of unforeseen events that make compliance impossible.\u201d The tolling rule is not statutory. It is a judicial graft on statutes that do not mention tolling. Scalia and Garner do not explain why that is permissible but a judicial graft disqualifying a murdering heir is not.\n\nScalia and Garner defend the canon of construction that counsels judges to avoid interpreting a statute in a way that will render it unconstitutional, declaring that this canon is good \u201cjudicial policy.\u201d Judicial policy is the antithesis of textual originalism. They note that \u201cmany established principles of interpretation are less plausibly based on a reasonable assessment of meaning than on grounds of policy adopted by the courts\u201d\u2014and they applaud those principles, too. They approve the principle that statutes dealing with the same subject should \u201cif possible be interpreted harmoniously,\u201d a principle they deem \u201cbased upon a realistic assessment of what the legislature ought to have meant,\u201d which in turn derives from the \u201csound principles\u2026that the body of the law should make sense, and\u2026that it is the responsibility of the courts, within the permissible meanings of the text, to make it so\u201d (emphasis added). In other words, judges should be realistic, should impose right reason on legislators, should in short clean up after the legislators.\n\nThe remarkable elasticity of Scalia and Garner\u2019s methodology is further illustrated by their discussion of a case in which the Supreme Court held, over a dissent by Scalia, that a federal statute providing that no state could require a statement relating to smoking and health to be placed on a cigarette package, other than the statement required by the statute, did not preempt state tort suits charging cigarette advertisers with misrepresentation concerning the health hazards of smoking. The ruling was consistent with the canon approved by Scalia that I mentioned earlier\u2014that a federal statute is presumed to supplement rather than displace state law. The majority held that suits based on the state\u2019s view of the health hazards of smoking were preempted (and this part of the decision Scalia concurred in), just not suits based on the duty to avoid misrepresentation. Scalia and Garner ignore the distinction, saying instead that \u201cwhen Congress has explicitly set forth its desire, there is no justification for not taking Congress at its word.\u201d But the statute was not explicit about overriding all state tort suits that might relate to cigarette advertising\u2014it did not mention such suits; and so the approved canon should have carried the day for Scalia.\n\nJustice Scalia has called himself in print a \u201cfaint-hearted originalist.\u201d It seems he means the adjective at least as sincerely as he means the noun."

    "text": "The women viewed the GABI program differently, however. At the center in St. George, they felt respected, even loved. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking of ACS,\u201d said one mother, \u201cbut then you think, \u2018No, I\u2019m going to the GABI program. It\u2019s completely different.\u2019\u201d The GABI initiative, along with several other pilot programs in New York, are part of a major effort by ACS to counteract its image as a \u201cbaby-snatching\u201d police force riddled with the same racial and economic biases that beset actual law enforcement in the United States. Together, the programs amount to an experiment: to see whether one of the largest child welfare agencies in the country can change the dynamics that have poisoned its relationship with the vulnerable families it seeks to serve and must oversee. It\u2019s a sort of idealistic gamble, deeply informed by critics who charge that child welfare agencies like ACS unfairly target the poor and the nonwhite, and treat all family crises with the hammer of child removal.\n\n\u201cIt used to be in the Bronx projects that all you had to do was shout, \u2018There\u2019s a cop in the hall,\u2019 and people would flee,\u201d said Martin Guggenheim, a law professor at NYU and a national expert on child welfare. \u201cNow you say, \u2018ACS is on the ground,\u2019 and people flee. That\u2019s one of the saddest parts: This is a helping agency, meant to support poor families, and the parents are terrified of the very agency whose charge is to support them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was so scared,\u201d one woman said, describing her terror when ACS banged on her door in the middle of the night. \u201cI thought they were going to take my kids.\u201d\n\nChanging the way a massive bureaucracy has done business for decades is no small task. Success relies not simply on new, more benevolent programs like GABI, but also on convincing ACS\u2019s community partners\u2014the private groups contracted to provide foster care and preventive services\u2014to embrace a new mission. It means convincing the holders of city and state purse strings\u2014the ACS budget is $2.7 billion for 2019\u2014to invest in experimental programs whose success won\u2019t be calculable for years, and whose failures will be splashed across the media, potentially costing government officials their jobs. Above all, it entails convincing families who, for generations, have viewed ACS as a threat, to give it another chance.\n\nIf successful, though, ACS could create a more benevolent model for child welfare that would be followed in other cities and states. ACS, which conducts more than 60,000 investigations of families each year, is one of the largest child welfare agencies in the country\u2014dwarfing many other states\u2019 agencies entirely. Its size alone guarantees that whatever happens here becomes a national model. \u201cEveryone in child welfare agrees that what\u2019s going on in New York City is relevant to the work happening elsewhere in the country,\u201d said Guggenheim. Instead of a government bureaucracy that is widely perceived as punitive and biased against the poor, ACS could transform itself into the type of agency that it wants to be: a resource families can turn to in times of trouble.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something to be said for why ACS partnered with us,\u201d Murphy said to the mothers at the St. George GABI center. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to operate out of fear, and they really want to be here to support people.\u201d The women nodded, considering the idea. Finally, one of them spoke, \u201cSo you\u2019re saying they want to change?\u201d\n\nIn January, Jennifer McClure photographed families at the GABI center in Staten Island. She then gave the parents and children art materials and invited them to draw on and decorate the images.\n\nFor more than 150 years, child welfare policies have swung back and forth between two polarized notions of how best to serve vulnerable children: Should they be removed from troubled homes, or should their families be helped? Should \u201cchild protection\u201d be the guiding principle, or \u201cfamily preservation\u201d? Where society lands on these issues has always depended on prevailing attitudes toward poverty. Reformers have long argued that taking children from poor families does nothing to address the root problem of poverty. In June, for example, Democratic Representative Gwen Moore of Wisconsin, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus who, as an 18-year-old college student, was temporarily forced to relinquish her own child to relative foster care, introduced the Family Poverty Is Not Neglect Act, which stipulates that children can\u2019t be removed from families solely on the basis of poverty-related issues. \u201cI went through the system, and was humiliated, and mistreated,\u201d Moore said in a 2017 interview. \u201cI see that there is a deliberate effort to destroy these families.\u201d Moreover, children who are placed in chronically overtaxed foster care programs experience long-lasting trauma and, as studies have shown, far higher risk of teen pregnancy, incarceration, unemployment, and homelessness, compared to children who are left in families with similar problems. Conservative critics, however, have essentially argued\u2014particularly during America\u2019s periodic drives to crack down on welfare\u2014that parents who can\u2019t support their families are, by definition, unfit.\n\nFor decades, child welfare policies have swung between two competing notions: Should kids be removed from troubled homes, or should their families be helped?\n\nFrom the mid-1800s through 1929, New York City and other Eastern cities arrived at a draconian solution, shipping as many as 250,000 children from impoverished tenement families West to the expanding U.S. frontier. Children placed on \u201corphan trains\u201d were offered for adoption at depot stops and churches along the way. (To modern eyes, many of those adoptions more closely resembled indentured servitude.) Then, in the 1910s, the pendulum swung the other way, as a movement arose to supply pensions to \u201cdeserving\u201d single mothers, particularly widows, so they could safely raise their children at home. (What minimal help that was offered, though, was restricted almost entirely to white mothers, as were the New Deal\u2019s welfare provisions two decades later.)\n\nIn the 1960s, things changed again, when the concept of child abuse was \u201crediscovered\u201d by a group of doctors that included C. Henry Kempe, a pediatrician who coined the term \u201cbattered child syndrome.\u201d Kempe\u2019s label\u2014which he described as deliberately \u201cprovocative and anger-producing\u201d\u2014helped lead to the establishment of mandatory child abuse reporting laws across the country. The idea was widely embraced, notes journalist Nina Bernstein in The Lost Children of Wilder, her account of the legal battle to reform New York City foster care, because casting child abuse as a \u201cclassless\u201d phenomenon\u2014no more endemic to the poor than the rich\u2014allowed politicians to isolate child welfare spending from the larger anti-poverty programs of the Great Society, which were by then already losing support.\n\nBut the focus on child abuse, which might seem a positive, child-oriented development, resulted in demonizing parents\u2014most often parents of color\u2014whose children suffered because of the environments they were born into. \u201cWhat was understood by some advocates as a social problem rooted in poverty and other social inequalities became widely interpreted as a symptom of individual parents\u2019 mental depravity,\u201d notes social critic Dorothy Roberts in her book Shattered Bonds: The Color of Child Welfare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been a classless problem, and it certainly is not today,\u201d said Gottlieb. \u201cIf legislators say, \u2018We\u2019re going to pour these billions into supporting poor families,\u2019 it won\u2019t go anywhere. If we say, \u2018We\u2019re going to protect children from abusive parents\u2019\u2014if we label a demon\u2014then the money can follow that.\u201d In the child welfare system today, she said, \u201ceverything we do for families is set up around the idea that \u2018We have to protect our children from you.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the 1970s, the class-action lawsuit Wilder v. Bernstein took aim at racial discrimination within the private agencies that handled New York City\u2019s foster care with taxpayer support, but which systematically excluded black children. Black children at the time were relegated to harsh, decrepit juvenile reformatories, in which, in some cases, more than 80 percent of the kids hadn\u2019t committed crimes but were simply would-be foster children. The racial disparity was so stark, Nina Bernstein notes, that the superintendent of one facility called it \u201ca plantation.\u201d By the time Wilder was settled in 1986, almost 15 years after it began, the city\u2019s foster care system was starting to explode amid the aids and crack epidemics. By the early 1990s, there were nearly 50,000 children in the system\u2014almost all of whom were black.\n\nPolitics at the national level only made matters worse, as the political establishment turned against welfare and began to argue explicitly that parents who needed support to raise their children had no business keeping them. In 1994, Newt Gingrich put it most bluntly: \u201cWe\u2019ll help you with foster care, we\u2019ll help you with orphanages, we\u2019ll help you with adoption\u201d\u2014but not, as Bernstein noted, with money for family preservation, a position that was echoed in the Contract With America that Gingrich proposed later that year. By 1997, when Congress passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act, establishing a tight timetable for terminating parental rights and offering foster children for adoption, the campaign against keeping families together had become so forceful that one magazine headline read, \u201cfamily preservation\u2014it can kill.\u201d\n\nThe force of the pendulum swing between child protection and family preservation is often driven by high-profile tragedies. In New York in 1995, Elisa Izquierdo, a six-year-old girl from Brooklyn, was brutally beaten to death by her mother after repeated reports of abuse from neighbors and Izquierdo\u2019s school went unheeded by the city\u2019s Child Welfare Administration and other city and state agencies. The case became a national scandal. Time magazine published a haunting photo of the girl on its cover, under the title, \u201ca shameful death: let down by the system, murdered by her mom, a little girl symbolizes america\u2019s failure to protect its children.\u201d The Child Welfare Administration was abolished, and ACS was created in its stead.\n\nIzquierdo\u2019s death sparked what has become a familiar pattern of overcorrection, common in the aftermath of such tragedies, in which child welfare officials ramp up family separations, in an effort to avoid another catastrophic \u201cmiss.\u201d Through the mid-\u201990s, notes a recent report by the Center for New York City Affairs, a policy research institute at the New School, the ACS caseworkers\u2019 union even counseled its members with the grim slogan, \u201cWhen in doubt, pull \u2019em out.\u201d And they did: In the three years following Izquierdo\u2019s death, the number of children taken into ACS custody increased by 50 percent.\n\nFamily preservation advocates like the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform call this a \u201cfoster care panic.\u201d It is hardly unique to New York. In the two years following the 1993 murder of a toddler in Illinois, the state\u2019s foster care system grew by 44 percent, rendering Illinois children more likely to end up in state custody than anywhere else in the United States.\n\nBut the need to intervene more is the wrong lesson to take from tragedy. \u201cChildren fall through the cracks not because child welfare agencies are devoting too much to family preservation,\u201d Dorothy Roberts writes, but \u201cbecause agencies are devoting too much to child removal.\u201d When there are too many children in foster care, she argues, there are neither enough foster homes to care for them, nor enough caseworkers with adequate time to identify those children who are truly at risk. Indeed, NCCPR notes, three years after the foster care panic began in Illinois, child deaths in the state had increased by 17 percent. Moreover, the focus on child protection creates perverse incentives for caseworkers and welfare agencies. \u201cThere has never been a preventive services worker in the history of child welfare who has ever been penalized for not helping a family enough,\u201d said Gottlieb. \u201cBut they are penalized all the time for not doing enough to protect the kid.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, a similar panic flared again, following the deaths in New York of two children whom ACS had left in their homes. That September, a six-year-old boy from Harlem named Zymere Perkins was allegedly beaten to death by his mother\u2019s boyfriend just weeks after an ACS caseworker closed his case. Two months later, three-year-old Jaden Jordan of Gravesend, Brooklyn, died. ACS had received an anonymous report that the boy was being kept in a dog crate, but for two days, caseworkers couldn\u2019t locate him, because they had been given the wrong address, and staff didn\u2019t know how to find the correct one in their system. Like Perkins, Jordan was allegedly beaten to death by his mother\u2019s boyfriend.\n\nThe ensuing public outcry was tremendous. \u201cHow ACS Failed Him,\u201d read the headline of a New York Post article detailing the abuse Perkins suffered. The city\u2019s other tabloid, the Daily News, lambasted Perkins\u2019s caseworker with a cover story that declared, \u201cshe let him die to get promoted.\u201d Then\u2013ACS Commissioner Gladys Carri\u00f3n, a reformer who had focused on preventive services intended to keep children out of foster care, resigned under pressure.\n\nSince then, ACS has been eager to repair its image. In June, it launched a public relations campaign featuring videos and subway ads with children and parents who\u2019d been involved with the system declaring, \u201cACS fought for my family.\u201d In June, the agency unveiled a \u201cCPS appreciation week,\u201d to honor New York City\u2019s child protective specialists, its \u201cfirst responders\u201d for children. And its new commissioner, David Hansell, who succeeded Carri\u00f3n in February 2017, has been courting the media in an effort to improve public perception of the agency.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of terrible tragedies,\u201d Hansell told me, \u201cand the dynamic we\u2019ve seen over and over again\u2014not just in New York City but across the country\u2014is that a terrible tragedy happens, it gets a lot of attention in the public, there are investigations, and so on. It leads the child welfare agency to be reactive and defensive and to be more draconian.\u201d He vowed to address this cycle by focusing on the root causes that underlie tragedies like child deaths, rather than seeking individuals or communities to blame.\n\nYet from 2016 to 2017, the number of children placed in foster care in the city increased 13 percent. Hansell attributed the increase not to caseworker reactiveness but to a rise in public reporting\u2014up 7 percent since 2016. However, in the year and a half following Perkins\u2019s death, ACS has also presided over a 54 percent increase in the number of cases it brought to family court, and a roughly 30 percent increase in emergency removals\u2014when ACS takes a child from parents before even seeing a judge. As a result, warned a July report from the Center for New York City Affairs, ACS staff caseloads have increased, families have been put on months-long waiting lists to receive preventive services, and family courts have been so swamped with cases that attorneys say it\u2019s led to \u201ca new level of dysfunction,\u201d with delays and deferrals \u201cthat impact every family in the system.\u201d\n\nI got a sense of this when I visited the Bronx Family Court, an imposing brutalist structure not far from Yankee Stadium. In June, in a windowless waiting room on the seventh floor, I watched a distraught young mother\u2014African American, like almost everyone else there\u2014approach the court clerk and two white lawyers who were complaining about the bad courthouse Wi-Fi and their children\u2019s college grades.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, what\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked. Her court- appointed attorney had left New York without anyone telling her, and her new lawyer hadn\u2019t shown up. \u201cI come every time [ACS] sets court appointments, and they never show,\u201d she said. The clerk apologized, then looked to one of the attorneys, who was there representing ACS: Maybe he should talk to the agency about why the mother\u2019s caseworker hadn\u2019t been in touch. The mother walked back to a wooden bench, where a young boy and an adult man waited silently. \u201cThis happens every day,\u201d she said, angry to the point of tears.\n\nInside one of the courtrooms, another African American woman, middle-aged, with braids pulled into a side bun, sat at the center of a U-shaped table, listening as her public defender explained that she\u2019d been accepted to an in-patient substance abuse program that allows parents to keep their children with them. A court-appointed guardian, there to represent the woman\u2019s young daughter, objected, saying it was too soon to place the child back in the mother\u2019s custody, and that the city should wait to see if she could stay sober. An ACS attorney concurred, arguing that the mother should only be allowed to see her daughter before entering rehab if she passed a drug test that day. The judge agreed to both requests, then asked the lawyers about their vacation plans before setting a date to reconvene in a month. The mother, whom no one had addressed directly, started to cry.\n\n"

    "text": "Cleo gets up early in the mornings to wake the kids\u2014three boys and a girl\u2014for school, and also stays up late at night to tuck them into bed and turn off the lights. She\u2019s there, standing off-center, watching as Sof\u00eda (Marina de Tavira), Cleo\u2019s employer, squeezes her husband in an awkward embrace before he climbs into his car to drive to the airport for a work trip in Quebec. She\u2019s there, again, when Sof\u00eda, distraught after a phone call with her mother, catches Paco, one of her teenage sons, eavesdropping on her conversation and smacks him in retaliation. He falls to the floor, crying, and she does, too, to console him. \u201cWhy are you still there?\u201d she glares at Cleo. \u201cDon\u2019t you have anything to do?\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s there, too, in the evening to open the garage gates for Sof\u00eda, who, in her husband\u2019s prolonged absence, returns from a drunken night out in her husband\u2019s gigantic Ford Galaxy. She veers into the driveway, slamming and scraping the car against the concrete walls before slipping out. \u201cNo matter what they tell you,\u201d Sof\u00eda slurs, clutching Cleo\u2019s face by the doorway, \u201cwe women are always alone.\u201d Her words linger, as Cleo, frozen and expressionless, stares back. There is a fleeting recognition of the two women\u2019s shared pain, but it\u2019s immediately overshadowed by their lopsided relationship. Sof\u00eda walks into the house, up the staircase and to her room, as Cleo stands outside, out of focus, looking in.\n\nThe concepts for Roma can be found in Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s work from over a decade and a half ago, in his seminal 2001 film Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n\u2014a raunchy, semi-autobiographical story about two adolescents, played by Diego Luna and Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, who convince a married Spanish woman fed up with her husband\u2019s infidelities to road-trip with them across Mexico. Within months of its release, the film had become a cult classic for audiences abroad. Critics praised Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s visceral and layered storytelling, social analysis, and political commentary. \u201cIt is as if the American Pie DVD had a director\u2019s commentary by Susan Sontag or JK Galbraith,\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw wrote in 2002. Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n and similar movies from the time\u2014such as Alejandro I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s brilliant Amores Perros (2000)\u2014paved the way for an ambitious, probing movie like Roma, which is now considered a contender for Best Picture at the upcoming Academy Awards.\n\nBut there\u2019s also a direct link between the story told in Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n and Roma. As the trio in the earlier movie drives south along the semi-arid ridges of Oaxaca, skirting small towns, the movie\u2019s brash, teenage protagonist Tenoch (Diego Luna) notices a sign. It marks Tepelmeme, the birthplace of his nanny, Leo, who had moved to Mexico City when she was 13. \u201cTenoch realized he had never visited Tepelmeme,\u201d the narrator explains. The scene reflects Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s realization, as he recently told Variety, that he knew relatively little about Rodriguez\u2019s life in Tepelmeme or about her existence outside the confines of his home.\n\nHe didn\u2019t take up this theme in Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n, though the film does offer glimpses of the troubled country that exists just beyond its focus. The movie\u2019s narrator alludes to the Zapatista rebellion in Chiapas (When the two teenage protagonists approach Tenoch\u2019s sister, who is marching at a student protest, to borrow the family car, she agrees on the condition that she get it the following three weeks to deliver food, clothes and medicine to Chiapas) and the pernicious effects of Mexico\u2019s modernizing tourism industry (\u201cBy the end of the year, Chuy\u201d\u2014a fisherman the travelers meet at the beach\u2014\u201cand his family will have to leave their home to make way for the construction of an exclusive hotel,\u201d the narrator says.). In several scenes, Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s camera wanders to paint vignettes of nannies and waitresses shuffling in and out of kitchens to serve meals, whether they are in an upscale home, or at a modest off-road restaurant in rural Mexico."

    "text": "The camera spins around our three central women, who also each spin in different scenes. Abigail toys with a male suitor in the woods, and he lifts her to whirl her around; Sarah dances at court to a bizarre choreography, which also requires she be lifted and spun. It\u2019s a symphony in disorientation, underscoring the bewilderment each character experiences as their m\u00e9nage a trois shifts its balance.\n\nIf The Favourite is an exercise in naturalism, it also contains a profound artifice. Each scene is an elaboration of raw materials, like a headdress sculpted out of fruit. The tapestries that cover the walls of the Queen\u2019s bedroom seem to hold the blue English daylight coming in from the windows. As in Bergman\u2019s Fanny and Alexander, these fiber-and-wood interiors feel shockingly new to our plastic-adjusted eyes. One morning, Abigail rides out to the woods in search of herbs to soothe Anne\u2019s gout. The dawn light is the slightest cobalt glow, with Hatfield House\u2019s wisteria flowing down the walls in a lavender rain. When Sarah goes missing, riders seek her with flaming torches against a sky so indigo that it looks like paint.\n\nThe daylight feels like fresh water; the candlelight yellow and greasy like an overly aged Chardonnay. Fire is cooled against white marble. A white rabbit hops on a dark hardwood floor. A single teardrop blazes against Emma Stone\u2019s daylit cheek. Politicians cavort by night, throwing fruit in slow motion at a laughing naked man, cut against shots of Sarah galloping into the woods on a black horse. Bare trees in the moonlight, bare bums in the palace\u2014both shine.\n\nAtsushi Nishijima / 20th Century Fox\n\nI understand pearls now, having seen them filmed this way. Oddly, I also understand the powdered wigs and mouches of the men of this time; Nicholas Hoult as the politician Robert Harley is bitchy and radiant in his makeup. Most of his scenes are interior and at night, as he stalks the house holding candles, lighting himself like Caravaggio\u2019s David against the black. Hair and makeup designer Nadia Stacey explains, \u201cIt\u2019s probably the only period in history where the men were so much more adorned than the women.\u201d Anne, Sarah, and Abigail are mostly barefaced, though their changing appearances track their fortunes. As Abigail gains power, her hair gets higher, while the descending Sarah is injured by a horse, forcing her to wear a streak of black lace against her face.\n\nThe script is splashy and acidic. Sarah tells the queen that she looks \u201clike a badger\u201d in makeup. One male politician keeps a duck named Horatio on a leash. \u201cMust the duck be here?\u201d Harley asks. The answer: \u201cHoratio is the fastest duck in the city!\u201d Sarah keeps the Queen\u2019s books, and derides a staffer for exceeding her \u201ctapestry budget.\u201d The political context is the war in France, with the Whigs and Tories each beseeching Anne to go in a different direction. It\u2019s a fairly straightforward allegory of the fight between Abigail and Sarah, but it also gives Hoult a chance for some great lines. In one scene, he extorts Abigail for information. \u201cOh look, a wren, how cute,\u201d he says, before pushing her in a ditch. As Sarah makes one final attempt at bullying Abigail, the new royal pet retorts, \u201cAll I know is, your carriage awaits and my maid is on her way up with something called a pineapple.\u201d"

    "text": "The title set the pace for Marvel Comics (as the line was now called). The formula for Marvel Comics evolved helter-skelter as Lee and Kirby poured out many monthly titles: flawed heroes, stories that mixed folklore with space opera, open-ended plots, and allegorical allusions to contemporary politics (frequently touching on the evil of discrimination). Lee and Kirby brought this formula to a host of characters: Thor, the Hulk, the X-Men, the Silver Surfer, the Black Panther, many more. Less prolific, Ditko collaborated with Lee on the gritty Spider-Man and the psychedelic Doctor Strange.\n\nBecause Lee encouraged Kirby and Ditko to cross-pollinate their narratives, Marvel Comics started to gain the cohesion of a shared universe, an innovation in popular culture that would later be replicated when Hollywood producers shaped the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nAs Lee was the public face of the company, while Kirby and Ditko were freelancers, early press accounts, encouraged by Lee\u2019s credit-hogging tendencies, tended to portray him as the mastermind behind the Marvel Universe. \u201cI\u2019ll take any credit that isn\u2019t nailed down,\u201d Lee once joked.\n\nLee as creator of the Marvel Universe was a myth. Kirby and Ditko were the main creators of the characters and they plotted out most of the stories they worked on. Lee added the dialogue in after the fact. And the dialogue was always the weakest part of any comic he worked on.\n\nLee\u2019s true genius was not as a writer or creator but as an editor, who brought the best talent to Marvel and pushed writers in the right direction, helping them flourish. Lee\u2019s jokey hyperbolic carnival barker prose, alliterative and infectious, also helped give the Marvel line a comfortable cohesion that made them fan favorites.\n\nBut the success of Marvel Comics left Lee dissatisfied. Ditko left Marvel in 1966, Kirby in 1970, both men complaining bitterly that Lee took credit for their work. During the last years of their lives Kirby (who died in 1994) and Ditko (who died earlier this year) rarely spoke of Lee without rancor. Soon thereafter Lee himself stopped writing comics full-time and moved to the California, to try to sell Marvel characters to Hollywood. Initially it was hard going, but once special effects caught up with the visual imagination of Kirby and Ditko, the Marvel Universe, for better or worse, became a fixture of global cinema.\n\nComics made Lee world-famous, but part of him was always uneasy with that achievement. \u201cI can\u2019t understand people who read comics!\u201d he told the film director Alain Resnais at a cocktail party in 1969. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t read them if I had the time and wasn\u2019t in the business.\u201d\n\nIn a 1971 panel discussion, Lee offered even harsher words. \u201cI would say that the comic-book market is the worst market that there is on the face of the earth for creative talent, and the reasons are numberless and legion,\u201d he complained. \u201cBecause even if you succeed, even if you reach what might be considered the pinnacle of success in comics, you will be less successful, less secure and less effective than if you are just an average practitioner of your art in television, radio, movies or what have you. It is a business in which the creator, as was mentioned before, owns nothing of his creation. The publisher owns it.\u201d\n\nStanley Lieber transformed himself into Stan Lee, but there was always part of him that regretted the change.\n\nStan Lee, the midwife of the Marvel Universe, died on November 12, 2018, at age 95."

    "text": "From television origins (Gunsmoke), Reynolds became one of the most recognizable faces of 1970s American film. After negligible early roles in movies like Shark! (1969), he broke out (sans mustache) as archery ace Lewis Medlock in Deliverance (1972). That same year he also played \u201cSperm Switchboard Operator\u201d in Woody Allen\u2019s Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask).\n\nThose two roles express something at the heart of the Reynolds mystique: He was macho, lusty, and funny.\n\nAside from Deliverance, Reynolds\u2019s most iconic roles were in movies that eventually took on cult status. In Smokey and the Bandit (1971), The Longest Yard (1974), and 1981\u2019s Sharky\u2019s Machine (which he also directed), he played charming funsters with hearts of gold and biceps of steel. These roles turned Burt Reynolds into a symbol for a butch American sexuality.\n\n\n\nAmerica\u2019s overwhelming horniness for Burt Reynolds in the 70s and 80s was responsible for one of most iconic endings in Golden Girls history. pic.twitter.com/eKYL9EY28i \u2014 bobby finger (@bobbyfinger) September 6, 2018\n\nThe 1990s saw a Reynolds reprise, with turns in Striptease (1996) and Boogie Nights (1997). From the 2000s onward he seemed to enjoy playing up to the typecasting that arguably limited his career, cropping up in a heroic total of 37 movies this century, mostly in comic works like the Dukes of Hazzard remake. In 2019 he will appear posthumously in the Manson family dramatization, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\n\nHis long career included a 1973 album, featuring songs like \u201cThe First One That I Lay With\u201d and \u201cShe\u2019s Taken A Gentle Lover.\u201d He winkingly embodied an American masculinity that women laughed over and men sought to emulate. With Reynolds\u2019s death, America has lost its least subtle and most charismatic old-school Adonis. With a wink and a grin, he has disappeared into the sunset."

    "text": "With that exposition done and dusted, he can wander in search of booze into a drag club. There, he sees Ally perform \u201cLa Vie En Rose,\u201d and he\u2019s done for. She warbles a song for him in a parking lot, he pulls her onstage to sing it once more, and she becomes a star. He flails, she sings, then a dramatic twist pulls it all to a satisfying close. Along the way they get a puppy.\n\nI can only describe the experience of watching A Star is Born as like watching the trailer for A Star is Born, except that it takes longer. Almost all the elements represented by montage in the trailer are also represented by montage in the movie, instead of the full scenes that one might expect. Ally\u2019s ascent to stardom is played out in blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it hyperspeed. As in the trailer, there is absolutely no transition between Ally singing in the parking lot and her performing on stage with Jackson. Did they practice off-screen, at some unseen appointment? Or are they musically psychic, improvising the now-famous \u201csha-sha-sha-shallow\u201d harmony?\n\nCharacters are left to move the plot along through rich koans of plot exposition. When Cooper goes to see his childhood friend Noodles (for that is his name, played by Dave Chappelle), he conveniently reminisces that they have known each other since a specific date in time. Without that line, we\u2019d have absolutely no idea who Noodles was. He\u2019s a cutout. Ally and Jackson\u2019s characters suffer something of the same fate. One is a gin bottle wearing a hat and a guitar; the other a bewigged girl who is insecure about her nose but really good at writing songs.\n\nThe whole thing rests on the performances, and, thankfully, Cooper and Gaga are both outstanding. Despite the fact that his music is objectively bad, Jackson Maine comes off as a black hole of emotional need, the kind of damaged and charismatic man who can pull love out of your chest.\n\nBut Gaga is the real surprise here. She seems unable to move her eyebrows, left to emote solely with her eyelids and the few remaining wrinkles on the sides of her nose. But her voice is in there, and she uses it to bring Ally to life. Before her character becomes extremely famous, Gaga does Ally with humor, vulnerability, and humanity\u2014three qualities noticeably missing from Gaga\u2019s own career. As a friend noted to me, that contrast is the making of the movie. If Lady Gaga had played Lady Gaga, it never would have worked."

    "text": "In 1952, the psychoanalyst and revolutionary Frantz Fanon observed that in comic books, \u201cthe Wolf, the Devil, the Evil Spirit, the Bad Man, the Savage are always symbolized by Negroes or Indians.\u201d Things have changed since then, though not as thoroughly as some would like. Black Panther is Marvel Studios\u2019 eighteenth film and its first to feature a non-white male lead. But while this movie, like the seventeen that preceded it, takes places in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Black Panther truly operates in a world apart. The bulk of the movie takes place in Wakanda, a fictional Central African monarchy that is secretly the richest and most technologically advanced nation on earth. Wakanda owes its stability to the wise stewardship of the Black Panthers, for centuries the hereditary rulers of the nation, and its wealth to vibranium, a mysterious element used in the construction of both advanced maglev trains and sonic cannons.\n\nWakanda makes for a fascinating tableau, one realized in vivid detail by director and co-screenwriter Ryan Coogler and Academy Award\u2013nominated cinematographer Rachel Morrison. This idyllic society successfully marries scientific innovation with tribal traditions and an egalitarian ethos\u2014during periods of royal succession, a leader from each of Wakanda\u2019s five ethnic groups may challenge the heir presumptive for the throne. T\u2019Challa, played with dignified restraint by Chadwick Boseman, has recently ascended to the throne following the death of his father T\u2019Chaka, only to find his reign challenged by foes (Michael B. Jordan\u2019s smoldering Eric Killmonger and Andy Serkis\u2019s manic Ulysses Klaue) and friends (Lupita Nyong\u2019o\u2019s radiant Nakia and Daniel Kaluuya\u2019s brooding man at arms W\u2019Kabi) alike.\n\nBetween epic set pieces and panoramic vistas Black Panther engages with the pan-Africanist theories that ultimately compelled Fanon to take up arms, joining the Algerian Liberation Front in 1955. During this time, Fanon treated Algerians tortured by the French, and came to believe that colonized peoples had the right to pursue their liberation by any means necessary. But Wakanda has never been colonized, and so interacts with the outside world with a quiet assurance that belies its supposed lack of development. Thus, Coogler\u2019s film draws an explicit distinction between T\u2019Challa\u2019s acceptance of his mandate to maintain Wakanda\u2019s isolationism, and Killmonger\u2019s desire to disseminate Wakandan weapons to dispossessed people of African descent throughout the world, in order to foment a revolution from below.\n\nKillmonger, the orphaned son of an expatriate Wakandan, grew up in poverty in the United States, his life shaped by the privation of the American inner-city and his experiences inside the U.S. war machine. He both desires to locate a home, a place he truly belongs, and yearns to correct at the point of a gun the injustices of a world order that so often exploits people of African descent. Jordan expertly communicates these conflicting motivations, tapping into the same angst and longing that lent pathos and an unusual depth to his portrayals of Wallace in The Wire and Oscar Grant in Coogler\u2019s debut film, Fruitvale Station. In one scene, he has a bristling exchange with a curator at a British museum that holds dozens of expropriated African artifacts, his mocking inquiries into the provenance of each finely wrought mask communicating a sense of injustice that stretches back centuries and across the Atlantic.\n\n"

    "authors": [
      "Alex Shephard"
    ],
    "text": "Sanders\u2019s campaign ultimately failed, but it could be argued that he won in the long term. Today, nearly every major Democratic candidate for president endorses some version of universal health care, which would have been unthinkable even ten years ago. The Democratic primary will be fought over issues like how to reduce inequality and tax the rich, as well as on costly spending programs like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. The party\u2019s most popular young star, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is an avowed socialist. Democrats, by a 10-point margin, now think that socialism is more appealing than capitalism, and that\u2019s significantly more true of people under 30. Polling has even suggested that 70 percent of the country supports Medicare for All, including a majority of Republicans.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s strategy is commonplace in partisan politics: to define the opposing party by its most extreme members. As The New York Times reported on Wednesday, focusing on socialism \u201ccould provide Mr. Trump with a potentially effective weapon in confronting an increasingly aggressive and more liberal Democratic Party, defining it through attacks on Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who describe themselves as democratic socialists, and other members of the party pushing progressive policies like a 70 percent tax rate and \u2018Medicare for all.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nThere is historical evidence that Trump\u2019s strategy could work, as red-baiting has been an often effective tool for conservative politicians over the past century. The question is whether that remains true today. As the Times acknowledged, \u201cthere is no evidence of any growing public angst about socialism sweeping the United States.\u201d It\u2019s true that Americans broadly see social programs like Medicare for All in a much better light than they do socialism itself. One August NBC/WSJ poll, though something of an outlier, found that only 19 percent of voters viewed socialism positively. Then again, Sanders may end up as the only Democratic candidate for president who defines himself thus.\n\n\n\nThe bigger flaw in Trump\u2019s anti-socialism strategy, though, is that it\u2019s forcing him to be staunchly pro-capitalism at a time when its popularity is severely ebbing. In doing so, Trump is forgetting one of the most important lessons of his 2016 victory. Hillary Clinton made the case that the economy was strong and that Democratic stewardship over it should continue. Trump railed against a \u201crigged\u201d system that had decimated rural and Rust Belt communities, and he vowed to fix it. This message, combined with his pledge to protect entitlements like Medicare and Social Security, was vital to his upset victory\u2014helping him to win key the states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. (His approval is now underwater in all three states by double digits.)\n\n\n\nToday, Trump is not only embracing the \u201crigged\u201d system, but further owning his own unpopular economic policies, notably the $1.5 trillion tax cut he signed into law in December of 2017, which largely benefitted corporations and rich Americans. In the State of the Union, Trump boasted that \u201cwe are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world.\u201d But many Americans still aren\u2019t feeling that heat, just as they weren\u2019t in 2016. Most of the economic gains have gone to the top 20 percent, and wage growth, while ticking upward over the past six months, has been largely flat throughout most of the economic recovery. This, much more than Sanders, is why more Americans have warmed to socialism. \u201cThe prime mover of millions of Americans into the socialist column has been the near complete dysfunctionality of contemporary American capitalism,\u201d argued Harold Meyerson in The Guardian."

    "text": "HBO / Warrick Page\n\nThis time, however, there are three stories. Leaving its delicious production aside, True Detective should be credited with giving us the best aging makeup television has ever seen. This new season spans something like five decades, and never looks wrong.\n\nTimeline A shows Wayne and Roland on the case of a missing pair of children in 1980. Timeline B sees the case re-opened ten years later; Wayne\u2019s hair is shorter and by now he is married, to the lovely schoolteacher named Amelia whom he met in Timeline A. Timeline C is the cruelest: Now in retirement, Wayne is struggling to remember his life through the cloud of dementia. A television crew in the model of the podcast Serial has dug up new evidence on the case, and put him in front of a camera. Slowly and reluctantly, Wayne confronts memories of his marriage (Carmen Ejogo plays Amelia with enigmatic appeal) and of the unsolved case. Between hallucinating his wife and waking up in his bathrobe in the middle of the street, Wayne drags Roland out of retirement for one more crack at the mystery. \u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Wayne says to Roland through old-man tears. \u201cStir some shit up with me.\u201d\n\nSo, yes\u2014this is almost exactly the same TV show that you watched in 2014. But certain changes mark it out. This season features a love story, which adds a little schmaltz and heartache to the proceedings. It\u2019s also much more serious about historical detail. Wayne Hays has the nickname \u201cPurple Haze\u201d from Vietnam, where he learned to track the enemy and suppress his emotions\u2014skills he reprises while on the job. He\u2019s also, obviously, black, working as a cop in the Deep South. While race was a small plot point in season one\u2014the cops who interview the older detectives are both black and Marty calls them \u201cyoung studs\u201d at one point, to raised eyebrows\u2014it is here at the forefront. N-words abound, and color is integral to the relationship between the two main cops.\n\nThe other great difference is Mahershala Ali himself. As the maverick, Matthew McConaughey was great. But Ali manages to outdo him, if only because season three demands so much more. He appears in the majority of scenes in the show, inhabiting three different stages in a single man\u2019s life. The show is eight episodes long, so in terms of screen time it\u2019s as if he has played three different roles in a trio of movies, back to back. The achievement is extraordinary, particularly because he does such a fine job of distinguishing the 30-something man from the 40-something man from the elderly man. The first is restrained but headstrong; the second hamstrung by emotional repression; the last abandoned, almost, to the flood of feeling that he has kept back for so long. His creased regret as an elderly man is impossible not to believe.\n\nIn the first five episodes, at least, there is not much new to True Detective round three in terms of the basic set-up. But in its narrative ambition and the great strength of its star, this show has managed to surpass its original outing. Love and time are the great motifs of True Detective and have been since its beginning. At the end of this triple-layered show, we ought to witness those themes configured in unprecedented dimensions. If nothing else, it should garner Ali better roles, more exposure, and bigger checks: No mystery there."

    "text": "At the end of If Beale Street Could Talk, Barry Jenkins\u2019s film adaptation of the James Baldwin novel of the same name, the main characters, Tish and Fonny, sit with their son in the visiting room of the prison where Fonny has been incarcerated for several years. As their voices fade and their conversation becomes harder to make out, a weary rendition of \u201cMy Country, \u2019Tis of Thee\u201d begins to play and the credits roll. The takeaway here\u2014unsubtle but still provocative\u2014is that for black families, burdened by the injustices of the U.S. legal system, citizenship is both a birthright and a plight. How can we feel at ease in a home that is also a torture chamber?\n\nThat is where Jenkins leaves us, but it is not the complete expression of where he wants us to go. This is his third feature-length film, and at the center of each of them is a love story. His first, 2008\u2019s Medicine for Melancholy, is a romantic drama about an extended one-night stand between two black hipsters in a gentrifying San Francisco. Micah (Wyatt Cenac) and Jo (Tracey Heggins) hook up at a party without getting each other\u2019s names. They spend the next day exploring the city they love, whose changes they are witnessing as young adults. Their differing views on the politics of blackness (Micah is race-conscious and activist-minded, whereas Jo prefers not to define herself solely through the lens of blackness), as well as Jo\u2019s existing relationship, threaten to derail whatever chemistry they have.\n\nJenkins\u2019s second film turned him into a star. Moonlight famously and infamously won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2017, though the Hollywood musical La La Land was originally announced as the winner during the broadcast. (Jenkins also picked up an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, co-written with Tarell Alvin McCraney, on whose play the script is based.) Moonlight is a triptych coming-of-age story about a young black Miami native named Chiron, alternatively called Little and Black at different points of his life. He grows up with a crack-addicted mother and adopts her dealer as a father figure. He is also relentlessly teased by other children for his imagined homosexuality. As a teenager, he has a single sexual experience with his only real friend, but the two young men drift apart as their lives go on to be defined by violence, prison, and the ongoing illegal drug trade.\n\nBoth Moonlight and Medicine concern black people trying to find pathways toward love that will sustain them through the hardships of their black American experience. In If Beale Street Could Talk, too, Tish (KiKi Layne) and Fonny (Stephan James) live a version of this, facing separation when Fonny is imprisoned just as Tish learns she is pregnant. It has taken until now for a filmmaker to adapt Baldwin\u2019s 1974 novel\u2014in part because his family has closely guarded the legendary author\u2019s estate\u2014but Jenkins shows a particular affinity for his work. A preoccupation with love, and more specifically with the ways black people find to express love among themselves, connects him and Baldwin. Neither is totally convinced that love is what will save us, but they still believe in its transformative potential."

    "text": "In identifying time with value, This Life can at times sound strangely like an economics textbook. For a neoclassical economist, any choice to spend\u2014money, effort, attention\u2014comes with \u201copportunity costs,\u201d the paths not taken. Thus a person\u2019s choices comprise a pattern of trade-offs: time spent earning wages versus time with family, the prospects of law school versus the sense of purpose in nursing work, keeping a dangerous job rather than risk unemployment. Modern economics assumes that prices reflect these priorities, pinpointing in dollars and cents how much of X someone will give up in order to have Y. Superficially at least, economic reasoning, the elite common sense of our time, is as much concerned with the stakes of our choices as This Life is.\n\n\n\nH\u00e4gglund doesn\u2019t entirely discard this reasoning. Instead he deepens it. To take free choice seriously, he argues, we need a conception of freedom that is not tied to selling our time and talents at the market rate just to go on living. We are in \u201cthe realm of freedom,\u201d writes H\u00e4gglund, when we can act in keeping with our values. By contrast, we are in the \u201crealm of necessity\u201d when we adopt an alien set of priorities just to get by. A great many of the choices most people face under capitalism fall within the realm of necessity. How do you make a living in an economy that rewards predatory lending over teaching and nursing? Or how do you present yourself in a workplace that rewards competition and often embarrassing self-promotion?\n\nEconomic thought treats these choices as if they were just as \u201cfree\u201d as Bill Gates\u2019s next decision to channel his philanthropic spending to this group or that. H\u00e4gglund sees it differently: Our economy keeps its participants locked in the realm of necessity for much of their lives, draining away their time in unfree activity. In the realm of necessity there is very little opportunity to spend our lives on the things we care for, to devote ourselves to what we think most worthwhile. Economic life may be a tapestry of choices, but as long as it directs its participants toward goals they do not believe truly worthwhile, a life of such choice is a grotesque of freedom.\n\nH\u00e4gglund formulates his criticisms of this system by taking liberal values more seriously than many liberals do. He shares the liberal conviction that people have to determine the meaning of their lives by individual reckoning. But he contends that a liberal who fully understood the meaning of this commitment would become a socialist. This is because the market economy dictates answers to the most important question\u2014what is our time worth? To be free is to be able to give your own answer to this question; but in our lives, the answer comes to us in the form of wages and such potent monstrosities as the rate of return on investment in our human capital. These dollar-and-cent measures make decisions for a boss or owner as for a worker: Mind the bottom line, or \u201cmarket discipline\u201d will replace you with someone who will.\n\nThe market presses some people closer to the bone than others, but it drives everyone, because it is a system for determining the price of things, among them time itself, and substituting that price for any competing valuation. You cannot exempt yourself, except in the rare case where you have \u201cwon\u201d enough or inherited enough\u2014and even then you are the exception, an odd rich person with economic power over others\u2019 time, not one in a society of free equals.\n\nThe market presses some people closer to the bone than others, but it drives everyone, because it is a system for determining the price of things, among them time itself.\n\nInstead of occasional exceptions, we need collective self-emancipation into a different regime of value. H\u00e4gglund defines his ideal\u2014democratic socialism\u2014as a system of public ownership of productive resources in an economy that aims at maximizing \u201csocially available free time,\u201d that is, making the realm of freedom as large and inclusive as possible. His democratic socialist society would create institutions that let us learn without incurring insurmountable debt, and work without fearing poverty or untreated illness. It would not make its members trade their time for mere survival. He invokes Marx\u2019s \u201cfrom each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.\u201d\n\nH\u00e4gglund can give the impression of gliding over the problems this society might face. There is always some work that not all that many people really want to do, unwelcome but socially necessary labor. There is no way around emptying bedpans, caring for the severely demented, sorting recycled goods, providing day care for other people\u2019s children, picking lettuce, cleaning up after concerts, and so forth. H\u00e4gglund writes that under democratic socialism \u201cwe will be intrinsically motivated to participate in social labor when we can recognize that the social production is for the sake of the common good and our own freedom to lead a life,\u201d making such labor \u201cinherently free.\u201d Yet it is hard to imagine the voluntary caretaking of others\u2019 needs that sometimes happens in families and religious communities scaling up to the national or global level solely \u201cthrough education and democratic deliberation.\u201d\n\nReaders who have these doubts, H\u00e4gglund writes, \u201cshould consider their lack of faith in our spiritual freedom.\u201d It is an important response, if not a decisive one. The certified best minds of their times have believed democracy a recipe for anarchy, women\u2019s equality a monstrosity, and so forth. Every age invents respectable formulas to convert local limits of imagination and experience into universal limits on reality. A book that presses against these limits does more service than one that dresses them up with libertarian bromides and a little evolutionary psychology, as too many of our \u201cbig thinkers\u201d do. H\u00e4gglund\u2019s question is not which marginal tax rate would be compatible with incentivizing effort in 2019. It is how to think about the basic ordering of the world. To the extent that readers find his argument persuasive, it is up to them to make it useful.\n\nCan a religious person who believes the ultimate stakes of existence are cosmically elsewhere also invest this life with the moral urgency that it merits? H\u00e4gglund argues vigorously that they cannot. But in practice the world is full of activists who are religious and who seem to square the circle in their own lives. Many of them say that their sense of the goodness and moral weight of this life, and their motive to uphold and transform it, arise from experiencing the world as infused with divine love, as a creation. For my part, I would not have taken this observation so seriously before I spent nearly 15 years living in the South among activist friends and movement leaders whose work is entirely stitched into religious community, language, and feeling.\n\nWhether or not H\u00e4gglund needs to save devotion from religion, This Life presents a vital alternative to certain kinds of nihilism that today\u2019s politics can produce\u2014when the news brings weekly updates of dire climate forecasts and America seethes under Trumpism. It is now almost ordinary to remark in casual conversation that things are pretty much over, that we are just waiting for the catastrophes and the resource wars to begin in earnest. In a decade or three, when we watch the floods at the coasts, the inland droughts, and the waves of refugees breaking on the border walls of Europe and the United States\u2014or even shattering the walls\u2014we will at least have seen it coming. There is a weird satisfaction in being among the ones who saw that capitalism is at once too venal and too powerful, or humanity at large too shortsighted and tribal to survive.\n\nNihilism has minor chords as well as major ones. It might be that, with so much disaster so thoroughly forecast, you will judge that the only thing to do is to draw up the bridges and look out for your own: spend college angling for a hedge-fund job, or stockpile rifles and ammunition, and hope that, whether with a MacBook Pro or a six-shooter, your grandchildren will be among the lucky few who can defend a secure spot in New Zealand or Montana. If you aren\u2019t heroically inclined, you may simply look out for your own without hatching much of a plan for their future.\n\nIf you feel the pull of this kind of thinking, H\u00e4gglund wants to persuade you that this is bad faith. We are creatures who care, whose nature is to grow infinitely attached to finite things. What we truly believe is worth our time, the natural things and the cultural forms in which we find the richness of this life, gives us an imperative to take responsibility for them.\n\nThis book might be, in other words, not so much about why to be an atheist as how\u2014how to embrace emotionally hazardous forms of existential commitment as weighty as religious devotion, and without the nominal assurances of religion. It is also perhaps less about why to be on the left than about how. I am not sure that anyone who has signed on contentedly for growing inequality mitigated by a little redistribution will be moved to democratic socialism by H\u00e4gglund\u2019s conception of freedom. But for those who start with some version of his politics, the idea that we should be fighting for control over our time might prove powerful. What does \u201cfree college\u201d or \u201cMedicare for all\u201d come down to, other than saying that our lives should be our own to use well, not parceled out in years of debt service and cramped by fear of future medical bills? What is the Green New Deal but an explicit engagement with the value of life, an effort to secure a humane future in a world where we do not live by exploiting one another?\n\nThe old labor slogan\u2014eight hours for work, eight for rest, and eight for what we will\u2014sticks around because control over our time really is the beginning of all other forms of autonomy. To understand our lives this way can illuminate rather abstract considerations, tying them to the most immediate, felt concerns of a finite life. What are we fighting for? For more of the only thing we will ever have, the time of our lives. Why do we fight for it? Because it goes so fast, and, for a human being who faces the tragedy of our situation, there can, and should, never be enough of this life."

At the edges of precipices I feel it as a sudden absence, a classic \u201cbottoming out.\u201d Not only is the floor gone but my entire body with it: Nothing stands between the void and my core being. Vertigo is not so much a feeling about life or death as some sudden and horrific mixture of the two.\n\n\n\nFree Solo, a new documentary by filmmaker E. Chai Vasarhelyi (Meru) and photographer/climber Jimmy Chin, gets very close to capturing this sensation on film. It follows Alex Honnold\u2014described by a rock climber friend of mine as \u201ca nut\u201d\u2014on his quest to climb Yosemite\u2019s El Capitan cliff face. He wants to do it without a rope.\n\nSeveral people try to explain just how unhinged this idea is. Tommy Caldwell, a role model to Honnold, asks us to \u201cimagine an Olympic gold medal level achievement, but if you don\u2019t get the gold medal\u2014you die.\u201d It\u2019s a sheer face of granite, 3,200 feet high. Honnold picks a route, then tests it out with the safety gear on, for practice. His confidence is beyond belief; so far, he has simply never fallen. But now he falls, falls again, then again. There seems to be no way that he could survive a \u201cfree solo\u201d climb.\n\nWhy would a person want to do such a thing? As the documentary gets closer to Honnold the man, it only gets harder to understand what drives him. He has enormous brown eyes and a fidgety affect. He has a reasonable income, presumably from sponsorships (it\u2019s not explained), but he lives in a van and calls himself a \u201cdirtbag-climber.\u201d He\u2019s committed to environmental issues, but finds it hard to relate to people."

    "text": "The international community\u2019s response to mass detention in China has been \u201canemic\u201d so far, Sophie Richardson, the China Director of Human Rights Watch told me. Western diplomats and U.N. human rights officials have denounced China\u2019s actions in Xinjiang, and Vice President Mike Pence is the most senior Trump administration figure to condemn it. But as of yet, the administration\u2019s intense focus on tariffs to punish Chinese trade malfeasance has not included threats of targeted sanctions to punish human rights violations. \u201cWhat does it say when a permanent member of the UN Security Council can do this in view of the whole world?\u201d Richardson said, referring to China\u2019s mass detention program. \u201cWe can\u2019t say we didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nBut not only has the U.S. known about China\u2019s Uighur detentions\u2014at crucial points, it has in fact bolstered Beijing\u2019s case for the persecution.\n\nThe modern Chinese state has long treated the Turkic-speaking Uighurs with anxiety and unease over their distinct culture and Islamic identity forged over centuries. Xinjiang\u2014almost the size of Alaska\u2014is China\u2019s largest region, a land of vast deserts once so inhospitable that it is believed to have been among the last places on earth to be settled, requiring irrigation techniques for habitability. After Mao Zedong seized power in 1949, the Chinese government encouraged the migration of ethnic Han to the territory to fend off independence efforts in the region. Tensions simmered for decades as the government sought to mold Uighurs into loyal supporters of the Communist Party. The government pushed policies to spread the Mandarin language and Chinese culture, and imposed restrictions on how Uighurs could express their faith. Today, 11 million mostly Muslim Uighurs\u2014nearly half of Xinjiang\u2019s population\u2014call it their homeland.\n\nThe U.S. designation of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement as a terror organization after the 9/11 attacks represented an \u201cinflection point.\u201d\n\nThe crisis in Xinjiang is worsening under Xi Jinping, the nation\u2019s most powerful ruler since Mao, and who continues expanding the Communist Party\u2019s influence in Chinese society after six years in power. \u201cThe party sees Islam as a threat to their continued rule over China,\u201d said Dr. Rian Thum, a researcher focusing on Uighur society at the University of Nottingham.\n\nBut the Chinese government\u2019s policies, Thum adds, have also been intensified by Western Islamophobia\u2014meaning that inaction in the present isn\u2019t the only way the United States has contributed to Uighur persecution. Thum says the U.S. designation of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement as a terror organization after the 9/11 attacks represented an \u201cinflection point\u201d that realigned the Chinese government\u2019s approach towards Xinjiang. Beijing subsequently portrayed any protest as a sign of disloyalty and desire for independence, and more frequently alleged separatist coordination with Islamist groups beyond its borders, leading to heavy-handed security crackdowns when unrest broke out. In 2009, mass protests that left almost 200 people dead in the capital of Urumqi prompted the government to cut off internet, phone, and text messaging services for a year in the region. Though few Uighurs turned to religious militancy, the government connected its security policies to the U.S.-led \u201cwar on terror,\u201d thanks partly to the precedent set by the United States\u2019 extended Guantanamo Bay detention of 22 Uighurs captured in Afghanistan in 2001\u2014now widely seen as a mistake. In 2004, Amnesty International claimed to have evidence the U.S. had even hosted a Chinese interrogation of the detainees in 2002."

    "text": "In the summer of 1902, a 20-year-old Puerto Rican woman named Isabel Gonzalez set sail for New York City from San Juan. She was pregnant, a recent widow, and had few economic options in Puerto Rico. Her brother was working in a factory in New York, and her aunt had also recently moved there and married the well-connected Puerto Rican journalist Domingo Collazo. With their help, Gonzalez must have thought, she could make a new life in the city. So that summer, she left her two-year-old daughter with her mother in San Juan, telegraphed ahead to her family to meet her, and got on a ship with just eleven dollars in her pocket. She could not have known that her arrival in the mainland United States would set in motion a controversy that would change how we interpret the U.S. Constitution itself.\n\nALMOST CITIZENS: PUERTO RICO, THE U.S. CONSTITUTION, AND EMPIRE by Sam Erman Cambridge University Press, 288 pp., $49.99\n\nWhen Gonzalez boarded her ship in San Juan, she likely would have expected to be admitted without trouble in New York. Her aunt, after all, had made the same trip just a year before. And American officials carefully avoided treating Puerto Rican immigrants as aliens because they did not want to give anti-imperialist politicians, especially those in the Democratic Party, a way to attack the new colonial system the United States was developing to govern Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and the Philippines. But unfortunately for Gonzalez, U.S. immigration policy changed sharply while she was sailing north. Under new rules, Puerto Ricans were to be treated like immigrants from foreign countries. So instead of meeting her family on the docks in New York harbor, Gonzalez was sent to Ellis Island, where immigration officials detained her as an unmarried mother \u201clikely to become a public charge.\u201d Her uncle offered to provide for her, but inspectors eventually classified her as an undesirable alien and refused to let her in.\n\nGonzalez was a proud and intrepid woman, and she fought for her right to enter the country. She even hid the fact that she got married once she was out on parole\u2014which would have allowed her to stay in New York but also would have ended her court case\u2014so that she could continue her legal battle for citizenship. With the help of her uncle and the New York lawyer Frederic Coudert, she appealed her case all the way to the Supreme Court. The Court\u2019s decision was fundamentally ambiguous\u2014it held that she was not an alien and so could enter the country, but it did not decide whether she was a U.S. citizen. That very ambiguity, however, helped clarify the status of Puerto Ricans under a burgeoning U.S. empire at the turn of the twentieth century: more than foreigners, but less than full citizens with genuine self-determination and the complete suite of constitutional rights. Though Congress has subsequently extended citizenship to Puerto Ricans by statute, Gonzalez\u2019s case still stands as Supreme Court precedent for what rights the Constitution guarantees to Americans living in the territories, including Puerto Ricans today. It remains the case that Puerto Ricans cannot vote in presidential elections, that their representatives cannot vote in Congress, and that the federal government can and does provide substantially less funding for programs like Medicaid in Puerto Rico than it does in the states.\n\nSam Erman tells Gonzalez\u2019s story in his absorbing new book Almost Citizens: Puerto Rico, the U.S. Constitution, and Empire. In Erman\u2019s account, Gonzalez is one of a number of activists who fought a 20-year battle to redefine the Constitution after the United States acquired Puerto Rico and the Philippines in 1899 out of the Spanish-American War. Erman is a law professor at the University of Southern California with a background in American Studies, and Almost Citizens shows off both his range and his substantial chops as a historian: The book is deeply researched and densely footnoted, but Erman\u2019s writing is also lively and lucid, and he has an eye for catchy stories and compelling characters. Most importantly, he has recovered a crucial history of the struggle over democracy, rights, race, and gender in America, a set of conflicts we have not left behind."

    ],
    "text": "To say these states currently have the death penalty is somewhat misleading. The death penalty is illegal in 20 states, either because the legislature abolished it or the courts forbid it, and most of the other 30 states no longer practice it. Fewer than a dozen states regularly carry out executions, and even in those states, juries are sentencing fewer people to death. Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement last year all but guaranteed that the Supreme Court won\u2019t abolish capital punishment for at least a generation, and yet the system seems less stable than ever.\n\nThere are myriad causes for the death penalty\u2019s decline since the late 1990s, when executions peaked. Violent crime dropped precipitously over the past 25 years, reducing the number of defendants charged with offenses that might qualify for it. The Supreme Court shrank that pool even further in 2002 by forbidding the execution of people with intellectual disabilities and those who committed crimes as juveniles in 2005. In 2008, the court explicitly limited capital punishment only to crimes \u201cin which the life of the victim was taken.\u201d\n\nExternal factors also played a role. Prosecutors sought fewer death sentences than they did in the tough-on-crime era of the 1980s and 1990s, and juries handed them down less frequently. Defendants who are sentenced to death go through a complex appellate process in both the state and federal courts, which can last years or even decades. Executions have become harder to perform as well. Under pressure by activists, U.S. and European drug manufacturers stopped selling lethal-injection drugs to the states over the last decade. While some states have found willing providers of those drugs, others have begun exploring alternative execution methods or simply given up. (In the latest example, the South Carolina Senate approved a bill last month to bring back the electric chair and allow firing squads, too.)\n\nIn some Western states, lawmakers would be finishing what the other branches of government started. Washington\u2019s state Senate voted to repeal its capital punishment statute last week after the state Supreme Court struck down the death penalty in 2018. The judges had pointed to evidence that it was being imposed in a racially discriminatory manner. Washington Governor Jay Inslee, a Democrat, had already imposed a moratorium on executions in 2014, citing concerns about \u201ctoo many flaws in the system.\u201d One of those flaws was the geographic disparity in how local officials wielded it. \u201cThe use of the death penalty in this state is unequally applied, sometimes dependent on the budget of the county where the crime occurred,\u201d he said.\n\nLawmakers in some states have been vocal about their frustrations with the current state of affairs. Almost 80 prisoners await execution on Nevada\u2019s death row, though none have been put to death since 2006. \u201cWe waste so much money pretending to be harsh on crime and putting people into custody and telling them we\u2019re going to kill them, and it never ever happens,\u201d Ozzie Fumo, a Democratic state assemblyman who introduced the bill, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. \u201cThis bill will just codify what the will of the people is, and it\u2019s to stop this absurdity.\u201d With Democrats in control of both legislative chambers and the governor\u2019s mansion for the first time since the 1990s, the bill has a reasonable chance of becoming law."

    "text": "With all the shouting it was easy to miss, but something new happened in Washington this week. If you can\u2019t see it yet, put yourself back in 2006, when everything about a Somali-American, Muslim congresswoman tweeting a line from a Puff Daddy song\u2014as Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar did Sunday evening\u2014would have been unthinkable.\n\nIn March 2006, two established, neo-realist foreign policy wonks named John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt published an article in the London Review of Books. They argued that outsized U.S. support for Israel, which receives more U.S. military aid than any other country on the planet, made little sense in a post\u2013Cold War context in which Israel was no longer a \u201cvital strategic asset.\u201d Mearsheimer and Walt attributed the irrational persistence of this policy to highly effective lobbying efforts \u201cto steer US foreign policy in a pro-Israel direction.\u201d The Israel Lobby, as they called it, was not a cabal or a conspiracy, but something altogether ordinary in Washington, like the gun lobby or the steel lobby: a \u201cloose coalition of individuals and organizations\u201d encompassing Christian evangelicals, neo-conservatives, and the powerful America Israel Public Affairs Committee, whose support or opposition could make or break a candidate. \u201cThe bottom line,\u201d they wrote, \u201cis that AIPAC, a de facto agent for a foreign government, has a stranglehold on Congress, with the result that U.S. policy towards Israel is not debated there.\u201d\n\nTo almost anyone with experience in American electoral politics, Mearsheimer and Walt were stating the obvious: The near unanimity of politicians\u2019 support for Israel resulted not from inborn Zionist sympathies, but rather organizing and influence\u2014which in Washington invariably involves money. The uproar was nonetheless fierce. Pundits lined up to get their kicks in. Jeffrey Goldberg, writing in The Atlantic, called the two authors \u201cneo-Lindberghians\u201d and characterized Walt as a \u201cgrubby Jew-baiter\u201d who \u201cmakes his living scapegoating Jews.\u201d David Rothkopf, in Foreign Policy, was only slightly more generous: While Mearsheimer and Walt \u201cmay not be anti-Semites themselves,\u201d he allowed, \u201cthey made a cynical decision to cash in on anti-Semitism.\u201d Jonathan Chait went after them repeatedly in the pages of The New Republic, dismissing their views as \u201csimply kooky.\u201d\n\nBy the time Ilhan Omar walked onto the national stage, a lot had changed, and not much at all. Since 2006, we\u2019ve seen three devastating and overwhelmingly one-sided Israeli assaults on Gaza, the massive expansion of settlements in a brutal and seemingly endless occupation, the collapse of U.S.-sponsored peace negotiations and anything that could be called an Israeli \u201cleft,\u201d a widening gulf between Israeli and American Jews, and an Israeli prime minister who went out of his way to embarrass a popular Democratic president and to embrace the neo-fascist right. Ever-larger cracks are appearing in the defensive wall the U.S. media has for years erected around Israel: Critical voices\u2014even Palestinian ones\u2014are increasingly making it into the op-ed pages. Space for debate is finally opening up. And the controversy that blew up around Omar is a foretaste of how bitterly that space will be contested."

    "title": "How the United States Reinvented Empire",
    "authors": [
      "Patrick Iber"
    ],
    "text": "At first, the United States carried out its conquests of Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Philippines in the name of liberation from Spanish tyranny. But hopes for genuine self-rule among the people in those former Spanish colonies soon met the reality of U.S. occupation. Cuba gained technical independence but with compromised sovereignty, as the United States insisted on the right to intervene in its affairs and frequently did so. In the Philippines, pro-independence forces led by Emilio Aguinaldo suffered a brutal counterinsurgent campaign, which cast doubt on the efficacy, not to mention the morality, of U.S. policy. Mark Twain, who became the most prominent anti-imperialist in the mainland United States, imagined colonial subjects thinking: \u201cThere must be two Americas: one that sets the captive free, and one that takes a once-captive\u2019s new freedom away from him, and picks a quarrel with him with nothing to found it on; then kills him to get his land.\u201d\n\nAs Immerwahr puts it, the United States faced a trilemma. It could have at most two of the following three things: republicanism, white supremacy, or overseas expansion. It was republicanism that lost out. In a 1901 ruling, the SupremeCourt established that the Constitution did not fully apply to overseas territories. Their residents did not have the same rights as mainland Americans. Immerwahr details the many consequences of making these legal gray zones: counterinsurgency in the Philippines followed by colonial government; medical experimentation and sterilizations in Puerto Rico, and an economy arranged around exploiting its status as a tax haven; and Hawaii turned over to the military after Pearl Harbor. By the end of World War II, Immerwahr reckons, there were more people living in colonies and under U.S. occupation\u2014including in Japan and the U.S. zones of Germany\u2014than in the mainland.\n\nIn an era of airplanes and wireless communication, territory was not required for dominance; indeed, it could be a source of friction.\n\nThis was a temporary condition. The third era in the history of U.S. empire, from the postwar period to the present, saw a retreat from formal occupation. The Philippines obtained independence in 1946; Alaska and Hawaii got full incorporation; Puerto Rico, Guam, and Samoa got civilian rule. But the United States was not necessarily acting out of altruism. The struggles of colonized people for independence, anti-Filipino sentiment in California, and America\u2019s desire to claim the mantle of freedom in the Cold War conflict with the Soviet Union were all part of the picture. The United States was also strategically shedding the undesirable parts of its power: the obligation to maintain order, to support colonial administrations, and, from the racist point of view of many white Americans, the colonial ties that facilitated migration to the United States.\n\nInstead, it now kept an empire of bases: signing a 99-year lease for land in the Philippines, keeping control of Vieques in Puerto Rico, Guant\u00e1namo in Cuba, Okinawa in Japan, and many hundreds of other locations. In an era of airplanes and wireless communication, territory was not required for dominance; indeed, it could be a source of friction. Immerwahr, borrowing a term from historian Bill Rankin, calls this new geography of power the \u201cpointillist empire,\u201d and others have called it an \u201carchipelago.\u201d\n\nImmerwahr\u2019s book will arrive as perhaps the most hotly anticipated release in American diplomatic history in some time, in part because of an unusual professional dispute: He debuted the arguments of this book in early 2016 in the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations\u2019 prestigious Bernath lecture; the text of his speech was published, as is customary, in the field\u2019s leading journal, Diplomatic History. So far, so normal. What set tongues wagging was Diplomatic History \u2019s decision to publish, on the eve of the appearance of Immerwahr\u2019s book, an article-length rebuttal to the Bernath lecture, written by Paul Kramer, a historian of the Philippines, and entitled \u201cHow Not to Write the History of Empire.\u201d Since its appearance in September last year, the Immerwahr-Kramer affair has been one of the first subjects of conversation among historians in this field.\n\nFor an article in an academic publication, Kramer\u2019s piece made an astonishingly personal attack. It accuses Immerwahr\u2019s essay of \u201creflecting deep historical currents of nationalist arrogance and short-sightedness.\u201d Kramer says that in Immerwahr\u2019s account, the people of the colonies rarely appear and only count when they are part of empire; that the colonies matter to him only for the way they affect the history of the United States. Kramer also objects to Immerwahr\u2019s claim that mainstream American history has not accounted for the imperial role of the United States. Who, Kramer asks, counts as mainstream? His article includes an eight-page bibliographic appendix, listing books and dissertations on the subject of American colonialism.\n\nIf How to Hide an Empire resembled the work described by Kramer\u2019s critique, it would indeed be a problem. Yet as How to Hide an Empire makes clear, Immerwahr\u2019s argument is mostly intended for a mass audience, who won\u2019t likely be familiar with the large body of work on this subject. Its goal is to convince a reading public of the centrality of empire to U.S. history. To do this, it does anchor parts of the argument with familiar figures; it is written from the mainland out, rather than the colonies in. Making the opposite choice would also yield an interesting and valuable book, but it would be a different book. \u201cThe history of the United States is the history of empire\u201d is the line that closes How to Hide an Empire, and that is the point. On this, Kramer and Immerwahr would surely agree, in spite of the sparks.\n\nKramer\u2019s strongest argument is that writing a history of U.S. empire as a history of territory leaves out a great deal, since \u201cmost expressions of American global power in the twentieth century\u201d do not involve the conquest of new lands. Generations of American political leaders and government officials have sought and successfully developed more informal mechanisms of control, from economic pressure to CIA intervention. Parts of How to Hide an Empire bear out this critique. Writing of the 1960s, by which time Alaska and Hawaii had become states and the only colonies that remained were the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam and other parts of Micronesia, Immerwahr asks, \u201cWhere had [America\u2019s] imperialist spirit gone?\u201d But in a decade that saw major escalation of the war in Vietnam, the U.S. invasion of the Dominican Republic, and America\u2019s encouragement of political violence in Brazil and Indonesia, it\u2019s not hard to find the \u201cimperialist spirit\u201d at work."

    "title": "Amazon Shoots Its Hostages",
    "authors": [
      "Alex Shephard"
    ],
    "text": "Just a few months ago, it looked as if Amazon had pulled off one of the greatest scams in corporate history. Having dangled 50,000 jobs and $10 billion in investment in a proposed second headquarters in front of every struggling city and municipality in the country, they sat back as lawmakers debased themselves in a race-to-the-bottom to see who could offer the largest set of tax breaks and other incentives. When it came time to decide, Amazon told Detroit and Cleveland to shove off and settled in the two areas that least needed them, New York City and Northern Virginia.\n\nIt was the perfect plan\u2014for Amazon. The company collected valuable, often confidential data about infrastructure, educational offerings, and future development plans from areas they would have never considered moving to, which it will use to help perfect its logistics and business strategy. It also got some good PR, at least at first. While some cast the exercise as a capitalist Hunger Games, the HQ2 sweepstakes, as it came to be known, was also a massive marketing ploy, a yearlong corporate Bachelor in which cities wooed the trillion-dollar company. In doing so, it drove up the asking price. The result in New York was nearly $3 billion in tax breaks and a suite of other goodies.\n\nIn Virginia, things have mostly worked out for Amazon. Earlier this month, Governor Ralph Northam took a break from embarrassing himself to sign a deal that would provide up to $750 million in incentive cash. But in New York, the HQ2 deal was met with furious resistance. There were protests over the shameful corporate welfare being doled out to one of the most valuable companies in the history of the world, and the impact 50,000 white-collar jobs would have on New York City\u2019s already strained housing and transportation. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the newly sworn-in congresswoman who represents parts of Queens, slammed the \u201ccreeping overreach of one of the world\u2019s biggest corporations,\u201d while Senator Kirsten Gillibrand criticized the deal for its \u201clack of community input and the incentives Amazon received.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe case being put forward by the deal\u2019s critics was a good one. If Amazon wanted to move to New York City, they could absolutely do so\u2014just without the billions in free money that it absolutely doesn\u2019t need. Amazon brought in $233 billion in revenue in 2018. Bezos is worth $135 billion. And New York City is hardly thirsting for tens of thousands of white-collar jobs. But this was still too much for Amazon, which said in a statement:\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter much thought and deliberation, we\u2019ve decided not to move forward with our plans to build a headquarters for Amazon in Long Island City, Queens. For Amazon, the commitment to build a new headquarters requires positive, collaborative relationships with state and local elected officials who will be supportive over the long-term. While polls show that 70% of New Yorkers support our plans and investment, a number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward with the project we and many others envisioned in Long Island City.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that polling suggested that a majority of New York residents approved of the Amazon deal, though it\u2019s unclear if they also approved of the generous subsidies the company would rake in. But Amazon soon realized that the politics of the deal were not in their favor, and that they would face years, perhaps decades, of scrutiny from city and state lawmakers. The deal itself, moreover, would likely become a crucial issue in legislative elections, skewing both the City Council and the state legislature further against Amazon. And with activists bringing negative attention to HQ2\u2019s impact on housing and homelessness and the company\u2019s work with ICE, the deal was clearly becoming a non-starter in America\u2019s media capital.\n\n"

    "text": "In May 2017, Erin Kearns, an adjunct instructor at American University, gave a lecture on terrorism in the United States. Jihadists, she said, commit only a small portion of attacks on American soil, just 12 percent\u2014far fewer, in fact, than right-wing extremists do. People with far-right beliefs, like white supremacists and nationalists, were responsible for 35 percent of the attacks that had happened on American soil over the previous seven years, up from 6 percent in the 2000s. Not long after Kearns\u2019s lecture, conservative media sites the Daily Caller and College Fix ran articles attacking her and her methodology. PJ Media said she had been \u201ctrying to indoctrinate college students.\u201d (Jihadists, they pointed out, had killed a greater number of people.)\n\nThe data Kearns used was solid, however. It had been gathered by the University of Maryland\u2019s Global Terrorism Database, which was founded in 2002, shortly after the September 11 attacks. Since 2005, officials at the departments of State and Homeland Security have used the GTD\u2019s roughly 180,000 entries, each one listing a terrorist incident around the world, to analyze patterns of violence and develop counterterrorism strategies. The entries date as far back as 1970. Homeland Security provided much of the funding for the project in its early years, and since 2012, State has taken it on.\n\nThe summer after Kearns\u2019s lecture at American, Erin Miller, a criminologist who runs the GTD, learned that the federal government would no longer be funding the organization\u2019s work. The State Department had decided to give the contract to a firm based in Bethesda, Maryland, Development Services Group Inc., which had partnered with a terrorism center at George Mason University.\n\nIn August, the University of Maryland filed an official protest with the Government Accountability Office, alleging, among other things, that the State Department was biased against it. The Trump administration, for its part, claimed it made its decision on the basis of cost (Development Services had advanced a slightly lower bid for the contract), and the GAO dismissed the charge. But the Global Terrorism Database is not the first program to be shuttered after it called attention to the rise in violence on the right. Shortly after Donald Trump took office, the administration rescinded a $400,000 grant to Life After Hate, a group dedicated to stopping right-wing extremism in America. The Department of Homeland Security also backed out of a $867,000 grant promised to researchers at the University of North Carolina who were developing a program to stop young people from embracing ideologies like jihadism and white supremacy. The Office of Community Partnership, an arm of DHS whose mission is to prevent violent extremism before it begins, had administered those grants. After Trump took office, its name was changed, its staff cut in half, and its budget slashed by more than 85 percent."

    "authors": [
      "Josephine Livingstone"
    ],
    "text": "Constantine (2005) epitomizes the sillier side of Weisz\u2019s career. Starring Keanu Reeves as a hardboiled detective in a kind of purgatory, the movie makes use of Weisz as a psychic who helps the hero save the world. She\u2019s beautiful, she\u2019s inoffensive, and she doesn\u2019t really have to act very much.\n\nThese kinds of roles led to Weisz\u2019s blurring among her 2000s peers. She briefly became almost indistinguishable from Rose Byrne, Kate Beckinsale, or Keira Knightley. It doesn\u2019t take a lot of skill to be the kind wife from The Lovely Bones (2009), the scientist-girlfriend of The Bourne Legacy (2012), or a sweet girl named Summer in Definitely, Maybe (2008). Each of these roles is like her character in The Constant Gardener, in that Weisz plays a beauty who inspires affection in those around her, but that movie was made utterly distinct by her pairing with Ralph Fiennes and its direction by Fernando Meirelles.\n\nAnd so two different Rachel Weiszes are apparent: the eye candy who can fit herself into any sort of feminine template, fading neatly away into the background, and the serious actor who can transform a woman-shaped cutout into a living, breathing human being. It all depends on how good her colleagues are, and how much intelligence they ask of her.\n\nA turning point in Weisz\u2019s career came with The Lobster (2015). Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, the movie shows single people visiting a facility where they have 45 days to find a life partner, or alternatively be turned into the animal of their choice. She played Colin Farrell\u2019s love interest, \u201cShort Sighted Woman.\u201d The eerie film swept the European festival circuit, winning the Jury Prize at Cannes. Weisz was superb in the role, which demanded a rich, suppressed humanity. She has not made a bad movie since (Denial (2016) and My Cousin Rachel (2017) were both solid), and Lanthimos would later cast her in The Favourite, her finest picture to date.\n\nThree and a half decades after her first TV show appearance, Rachel Weisz still has the coltish grace but none of her teenaged self\u2019s reticence. After reliably trudging through the 1990s and 2000s as a pretty sidekick in movies about men, Weisz has managed to unlock a level of success rare among actors, let alone the \u201cgirlfriend\u201d type. She already has one best supporting actress Oscar, for The Constant Gardener, and this year she\u2019s nominated for the same award for her portrayal of Lady Sarah Churchill in The Favourite.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say who should get the \u201ccredit\u201d for an actor\u2019s work. Of course, Weisz deserves all the credit for Disobedience, which she herself adapted for the screen, and she doesn\u2019t deserve to have the stupidity of The Bourne Legacy laid at her feet\u2014she just followed the script. But those basic facts seem to indicate that an actor\u2019s worth is all in the hands of the producers and director, which doesn\u2019t quite fit the bill.\n\nIn the end, the only real power an actor has over her career lies in her ability to choose\u2014if she\u2019s lucky. In decades to come, Rachel Weisz\u2019s choice to elevate intelligent lesbian narratives is going to be seen as a historic moment in Hollywood. The key word here is intelligent: neither of her gay roles have anything like the gaudy foolishness of Blue is the Warmest Color or the nostalgic tint of Carol. Mainstream cinema about lesbians has long been near-irredeemable. From Chasing Amy to the gay bits of Black Swan, queer relationships between women have tended to work as ciphers for male desire, or strained metaphors for male genius. Either that, or a vague pretext for murder\u2014see: Heavenly Creatures (1994), Monster (2003).\n\nSo, one wonders why it took this long for a wise actress to do this work. The inspiration seems to have been with Weisz for a while: In a 2009 interview, she said, \u201cI want to be a lesbian icon.\u201d The interviewer asked Weisz about a 2008 English newspaper poll naming her a lesbian viewers\u2019 favorite. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic, don\u2019t you think?\u201d she said, adding that she would be keen to play a lesbian on screen. \u201cSomething like Ang Lee did [Brokeback Mountain] with a history of women.\u201d\n\nShe told The New York Times in 2018 that she\u2019d done a lot of research on lesbian love stories, reading \u201ca cycle of pulp fiction novels from the \u201950s called The Beebo Brinker Chronicles by Ann Bannon\u201d and \u201ca French lesbian novel called The Illusionist by Fran\u00e7oise Mallet-Joris about a girl who has a love affair with her dad\u2019s older mistress.\u201d On the press circuit, Weisz has not glorified herself as the savior of queer women, or been anything less than joyful in her accounts of what her lesbian roles were like\u2014as the glorious and viral supercut of her \u201cSupporting the Gay Rights\u201d attests, in detail.\n\nIn the end, the viral supercut is just the key to understand the Weisz phenomenon. She\u2019s respectful, she\u2019s enthusiastic, and somehow she manages to convey the feeling that her work is in service of the queer community, rather than performed on our behalf. It\u2019s not rocket science, perhaps, but it\u2019s a feat that nobody (pace Timothee Chalamet) in recent years has managed to quite pull off. We underestimated the woman who fled scarab beetles in 1999, and every unobtrusive girlfriend she has played since. Queer roles are a simple way to take the female love interest out of the margins, and bring her into the center. \u201cI really enjoy all the thousands of movies I\u2019ve seen about men,\u201d Weisz told the Times last year. We are lucky that her imagination goes further."

    "text": "Trump insists that the situation at the southern border constitutes a \u201cnational security crisis,\u201d but the facts don\u2019t support his justification for declaring a state of emergency. Border crossings have been in steady decline for more than a decade, undocumented immigrants commit fewer crimes than American-born citizens, most drugs are smuggled into the U.S. through or near legal ports of entry. If Trump really cared about stopping the illegal drug trade, he wouldn\u2019t reportedly be plundering $2.5 billion from the Defense Department\u2019s drug interdiction program as part of his executive gambit to secure more wall funding.\n\nTrump has now set the stage for yet another grueling slugfest in the courts. He\u2019s thrown Senate Republicans in politically treacherous waters by forcing them to choose between the public\u2019s antipathy towards the wall and the GOP base\u2019s enthusiastic support for it. And he\u2019s set a precedent that may allow Democrats to achieve key policy goals without the Senate\u2019s consent the next time they take the White House.\n\n\n\nFirst, Trump\u2019s declaration will likely have little practical impact in the short term. Legal challenges could place the wall funding in limbo for months or even years, like virtually every other major unilateral policy initiative rolled out by the administration. \u201cDid I ever say I was filing a legal challenge?\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters on Thursday. \u201cI may. That\u2019s an option. And we\u2019ll review our options.\u201d A federal appeals court allowed House Democrats to intervene in an Obamacare-related case earlier that day. Even if Democrats or other plaintiffs don\u2019t prevail in the end, delays in the lower courts could effectively run out the clock before the 2020 elections.\n\nWe\u2019ve been here before, most notably with the travel ban. His executive order to bar visa applicants from a several Muslim-majority countries went through three iterations before the Supreme Court signed off on it last June. It\u2019s impossible to know whether the justices would also approve Trump\u2019s state of emergency. Much would depend on the exact legal circumstances of the case, including who brought it and the grounds on which they challenged the declaration. No matter whether they win or lose, Democrats would likely reap some long-term benefits.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine that the Supreme Court strikes down the declaration. Perhaps the justices decide that Trump didn\u2019t act in response to a genuine national emergency, because border crossings have been declining for almost 20 years. Perhaps they decide that the National Emergencies Act of 1976 delegated too much of Congress\u2019 power to the executive branch. In either case, a ruling that constrained the executive branch\u2019s discretion would be welcome under Trump and beyond. Many of Trump\u2019s worst policies\u2014the travel ban, the family-separation policy, and more\u2014came from broadly worded legislation by Congress. Lawmakers should change that approach to lawmaking, and a nudge from the justices wouldn\u2019t hurt."

    ],
    "text": "Yet even they admit that because it\u2019s not a mandatory program, there will likely still be places where parents can\u2019t access good, affordable care. An analysis by Mark Zandi of Moody\u2019s Analytics found that Warren\u2019s plan would increase the number of children in childcare from 6.79 million now to over 12 million within a decade. Still, that\u2019s far from \u201cuniversal\u201d childcare in a country forecast to have over 25 million kids under the age of 5 by then, even if not all of their parents would want or need care.\n\nIn this country, childcare is an infrastructure problem. There are simply not enough providers in operation, either in formal centers or in informal home settings, with enough openings to meet current demand. That demand is only likely to increase if Warren\u2019s plan makes childcare far more affordable and better quality than it is today. Significantly increasing the funding available to provide care and compensate providers adequately will certainly entice more people to jump into the business. But there is nothing in the plan that absolutely ensures that enough providers open up shop and create new slots so that all families can take advantage of it.\n\nA universal childcare plan, then, will need to get the federal government directly involved in solving this infrastructure problem. Luckily there are models, both past and present, for the government doing just that. The first was also the only time that the U.S. actually had a universal, affordable childcare program. It came during World War II, when the country was trying to fill factories with the women left behind after men were sent to fight abroad and their young children needed somewhere to go. Lawmakers turned to the Lanham Act, legislation meant to fund infrastructure projects for the war effort, and reinterpreted its \u201cpublic services\u201d provision to also cover building childcare centers. Federal infrastructure funds were doled out to communities to create and staff new centers. The care was then made available to anyone at a heavily subsidized price of just $9 or $10 in today\u2019s dollars for 12 hours of care. They operated in every state except New Mexico.\n\nThey were wildly successful. Mothers loved them, and their children experienced concrete benefits that lasted well into their lives, increasing their employment and earnings as adults.\n\nThat effort was shuttered when the war came to an end, despite the protests of children\u2019s and women\u2019s rights advocates. But we still have a similar program in operation today. The federal government currently runs a network of high-quality, affordable childcare centers for the families of military members, called child development centers. They weren\u2019t always paragons of quality, however. In 1982, the Government Accountability Office issued a report that said military childcare facilities were in dismal shape, failing to meet fire and safety codes and all but falling apart. That eventually led to the Military Child Care Act of 1989, which increased funding and ultimately resulted in the construction of more than 200 centers and required the military to get directly involved in regulating and inspecting them."

    "text": "Croly\u2019s overriding political goal was to centralize regulatory power at the federal level, an objective he shared with ex-President Theodore Roosevelt, who had concluded that trying to use antitrust enforcement to reduce the scale of business conglomeration, as advocated by decentralist Louis Brandeis, was futile. But Croly\u2019s aspirations for the \u201cNew Nationalism\u201d Roosevelt advocated in his 1912 run for the presidency went way beyond deploying federal regulation to bring power-hungry capitalists to heel. He also fantasized that creating a strong national government would ipso facto result in the emergence of a cohesive national community that could replace the small \u201cisland\u201d communities being rapidly depopulated by advancing urbanization.\n\nIt is here that Croly\u2019s fundamental republican vision, along with its historical limitations, come into view. Although, despite their republican leanings, the Founding Fathers did not provide for direct citizen involvement in political affairs, the New England town-meeting model served as a viable substitute, as Tocqueville observed\u2014until it was rendered obsolete. Republican nationalist Croly remained committed to ensuring that the political economy of the nation be one that produces assertive citizens with a driving concern for the common good. Even as he proselytized for such a system, however, the activist \u201cproducer ethic\u201d of early America was being upended by the new model of passive consumerism. Both Lippmann and Weyl, in a very real sense, went over to the enemy, advocating consumer society as the desirable path for America\u2019s future.\n\nCroly\u2019s project of building a strong national government has been eminently successful, but it was na\u00efve of him to think that this achievement would necessarily produce an actual continentwide community. A nation of any significant size cannot feasibly constitute a genuine \u201ccommunity,\u201d but only (in Benedict Anderson\u2019s inventive phrasing) an \u201cimagined\u201d one. Yet even the status of imagined community has been difficult for the American nation to sustain, given its longstanding and deep-seated racial division. \u201cEgalitarian liberalism\u201d\u2014the phrase the political philosopher Michael Sandel uses to describe America\u2019s version of social liberalism\u2014has some outstanding achievements to its credit (Social Security, civil rights, Medicare), but its underlying ethic of mutual social obligation has not taken deep root in the American psyche. The withering of local community, together with the attenuation of the civic ethic, doomed America\u2019s once-vibrant republican tradition to a long period of retreat, though it has recently begun showing signs of a possible resurgence.\n\nThere is a striking similarity between the political challenges we face now and those Croly and his cohort confronted a century ago, the most noteworthy being the prevailing scandal of gross economic inequality. The solutions advocated by The New Republic of today will frequently differ from those favored by Croly\u2014for instance, we will call for significant political and economic decentralization, \u00e0 la Brandeis\u2014but they will all involve, as did his, an interplay between the two political traditions of liberalism and civic republicanism.\n\n\n\n* A previous version of this article wrongly identified the subject of the photo. It is Louis Brandeis, not Herbert Croly."

    ],
    "text": "A 2020 Sanders campaign, then, theoretically would lack both the novelty of his surprise showing in 2016 and the distinctiveness of his positions within the Democratic field. There will be other formidable challengers representing the left, like Elizabeth Warren, as well as a number of more establishment candidates, like Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand, who support policies Sanders popularized such as Medicare for All and a $15 national minimum wage.\n\n\n\nBut just because the space is more crowded doesn\u2019t mean that Sanders doesn\u2019t have something unique to offer. Julian Castro\u2019s 2020 announcement speech on Saturday is a case in point. He expressed support for Medicare for All, universal pre-K, and the Paris agreement, while pledging to \u201cnot take a dime\u201d in PAC money. But the speech itself was not exactly a Sanders-esque jeremiad against a rigged system. At times, he sounded like a second-rate motivational speaker. \u201cToday,\u201d he said, \u201cwe live in a world in which brainpower is the new currency of success.\u201d\n\n\n\nSanders is hardly alone in having clear weaknesses as a Democratic candidate. Voters remain angry that the economy disproportionately benefits a tiny sliver of Americans; if anything, that feeling has been exacerbated by Donald Trump\u2019s kleptocratic administration, which, with the help of a Republican Congress, redistributed $1.5 trillion in taxpayer money to corporations and the wealthy. And yet, some in the likely Democratic field\u2014including Harris, Gillibrand, and Cory Booker\u2014have begun courting Wall Street. This isn\u2019t necessarily prohibitive, but it lacks the purity of Sanders\u2019s stance.\n\nEven Warren, the candidate who most closely resembles Sanders, has stark differences. As David Dayen argued in The New Republic in October, they represent opposite approaches to the organization of the economy: \u201cWarren wants to organize markets to benefit workers and consumers, while Sanders wants to overhaul those markets, taking the private sector out of it.\u201d Finally, while a new generation has taken the spotlight in recent months, rising stars like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are too young to run, meaning that what could be termed \u201cthe Sanders lane\u201d will still be occupied by a single candidate.\n\nDespite claims of the Sanders movement\u2019s waffling momentum, he is still an enormously popular politician. Recent polling, both national and in Iowa, suggests that he is a frontrunner, trailing only Joe Biden. (Sanders is the second choice among Biden supporters; interestingly, despite his long history of favors for the financial industry, Biden is the second choice among Sanders supporters.) It seems possible that it\u2019s Sanders continued popularity\u2014and the role that some believe he played in Clinton\u2019s defeat\u2014that concerns figures, like Moulitsas, who are questioning his electability.\n\n\n\nThere are legitimate arguments for Sanders to sit this one out. His age is a serious concern\u2014he\u2019ll be 79 on inauguration day\u2014though that\u2019s also true of the 76-year-old Biden. Sanders benefited enormously from not being taken seriously in 2016; Clinton rarely attacked him, while the press, \u201cBernie Bro\u201d takes aside, went relatively easy on him. That won\u2019t be the case in 2020, especially with an emerging scandal from the 2016 primary: a number of former staffers have alleged lately that the campaign did not do enough to stop sexual harassment.\n\n\n\nBut it\u2019s simply wrong that Sanders can no longer stand out in a race for the Democratic nomination. While it\u2019s true that most of the 2020 candidates will claim the mantle of progressivism, none exemplifies it quite like he does. In his ideology as well as his personality, Sanders still occupies a singular place in American politics. Only people who are nervous about that enduring fact would argue that it\u2019s a compelling reason for him not to seek the highest office in the land.\n\n"

    "text": "The murderous spirit of Ventril Dease, unfortunately, appears to inhabit his works. One by one, the movie\u2019s key players are picked off by violent \u201caccidents\u201d that take place when they\u2019re near art. A rude handler reaches a sticky end while next to a tacky gas station print of some dogs. Somebody else gets their arm eaten by an expensive sculpture. It\u2019s all very schlocky, a little \u201880s, and extremely fun.\n\nThe criteria for suffering supernatural death seems to be simple: If you have profited off the artwork of Ventril Dease, which was never supposed to be exhibited, then you\u2019re in for it. That seems a straightforward critique, on first glance: Commerce destroys the spirit of art, and in this case the art is out for revenge. But the form that the violence takes suggests a more interesting and complex theme. You always know that a death is about to happen when some nearby object\u2014a doll, a painted face\u2014starts glowing out of its eyes. And the art that kills people is uniformly bad: graffiti canvases, a stupid installation, an overpriced objet.\n\nGyllenhaal\u2019s Morf is a ridiculous figure. He\u2019s rich beyond all reason for a critic, and likes to do ostentatiously transgressive things like write naked and get very, very close to the art he is appraising. He\u2019s also a dreadful writer. Dease was \u201cusing the art to dive deep into his own psyche.\u201d He calls another exhibition a \u201csnoozefest.\u201d (In an interview, Gyllenhaal has said that he based the character on New York\u2019s Jerry Saltz.) As Morf\u2019s mind starts to disintegrate in the wake of Dease\u2019s killings from beyond the grave, the celebrated critic visits an optician, because he has started \u201cseeing things.\u201d Josephina accuses him of \u201closing his eye.\u201d\n\nSo when those horrible little eyeballs start glowing, you know that a bad artwork is about to fight back against the over-privileged human eye of the critic. Graffiti paint creeps up the body of a woman who hates graffiti, ruining her minimal aesthetic; a Brancusi-like bronze tries to crush a woman who has just gotten too rich. It\u2019s as if every painting or sculpture deemed unworthy or otherwise abused by the industry (exploited for quick cash, say, or insulted) is revolting against their overlords. The critic is the last one they\u2019ll chase, and the most significant.\n\nAs Josephina puts it in a key line, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of art if nobody sees it?\u201d Morf\u2019s \u201ceye\u201d has been imbued with too much power, which has upset the balance between artwork and viewer. In between the glamorous silliness of the Basel scenes and Morf\u2019s bespectacled antics, director Dan Gilroy appears to be making a kind of John Berger-style argument about the way we relate to visual culture. In his famous TV series Ways of Seeing, Berger posited that premodern art often presented objects on canvases (food, women, landscapes) as a kind of subservient offering to the viewer-patron. In the twentieth century, he said, the artwork retained its status as a luxury object, but became newly swaddled in the \u201cfalse mystifications\u201d of concepts so inaccessible and mysterious that they required an interpreter. \u201cWhat may become part of our language,\u201d Berger said, \u201cis jealously guarded and kept within the narrow preserves of the art expert.\u201d"

      "Rachel Syme"
    ],
    "text": "The main creative team behind Documentary Now! is all men, which means that they mostly choose documentaries with male subjects to spoof: The Kid Stays in the Picture, Salesman, History of the Eagles. The scarcity of episodes with a woman at the center is disappointing\u2014I long for them to parody 20 Feet From Stardom\u2014but it does result in quite a few instances of both Hader and Armisen openly dissecting and critiquing patriarchal systems from the inside. Making a documentary can be an act of intrusion and manipulation as much as it can be an act of responsibility and care, and Documentary Now! investigates just how thin that line can be.\n\nIn the show\u2019s third season, its tone has shifted. For one thing, Bill Hader, who clearly loved the movies he lampooned, does not appear in these episodes; he is off making the second season of Barry, his HBO comedy series about a hitman who aspires to be an actor. Without him, the season has a harder edge: It doesn\u2019t just gently rib its subjects, it eviscerates them.\n\nIn \u201cLong Gone,\u201d the season\u2019s sixth episode, Fred Armisen plays an aging jazz musician named Rex Logan in a smoky, black-and-white re-creation of Bruce Weber\u2019s 1988 film about Chet Baker, Let\u2019s Get Lost. The original film was a near-sycophantic love letter to a jazz legend, presenting Baker as a cool cat who traveled with the wind, floating through hazy noir shots of cosmopolitan streets at night. \u201cLong Gone\u201d is far more sinister: Armisen plays a self-centered and dissociative musician, who at one point decides to abandon his wife (Natasha Lyonne) and child to live in a tiny European country and gets mixed up with a fascist dictatorship. The episode attempts to grapple with the men behind the original movie. Chet Baker was a libertine and an addict, and Weber has experienced a reputational reckoning of his own, after recent accusations of sexual misconduct. (Weber is challenging the accusations.) But the episode is weighed down with mea culpas and dramatic lighting, and never makes a really coherent political statement.\n\nOne finds the same sloggy heaviness in \u201cBatsh*t Valley,\u201d a two-episode arc that parodies last year\u2019s breakout Netflix series Wild Wild Country (with a dash of The Source Family, the 2012 documentary about a New Age cult in 1970s Los Angeles). Owen Wilson does a guest-turn as the charismatic leader of a religious group that takes over a small town in Oregon in the 1980s, just as the Indian mystic Rajneesh and his followers did. The episode drags because it doesn\u2019t bring a fresh gag to the proceedings; it simply replicates the story of Wild Wild Country, with a few added jokes about the FBI and vegan cuisine. When Documentary Now! shines, it does so because its fake films raise new questions about the real documentaries. I ended my viewing of \u201cBatsh*t Valley\u201d with nothing new to believe.\n\nThe third season, however, brings two standout episodes, both dominated by women. Renee Elise Goldsberry and Paula Pell star in \u201cOriginal Cast Album: Co-op,\u201d a parody of D.A. Pennebaker\u2019s documentary about the cast recording session for Sondheim\u2019s Company. The comedian John Mulaney co-wrote the episode, along with several brand-new show tunes, which so closely resemble Sondheim\u2019s rapid-patter style that I had to pause my viewing several times because I was laughing so hard. Goldsberry is brilliant as an ingenue who belts out a number about 1970s interior decoration, celebrating the colors beige and brown, and Pell does a spot-on tribute to Elaine Stritch. It is clear that everyone involved with the episode is having fun making it. How could they not? They are performing an entirely fictitious Broadway musical in period costumes straight out of Taxi Driver."

    ],
    "text": "Though Reese\u2019s arguments are compelling, he doesn\u2019t believe that this kind of reasoning is what will ultimately drive a change. He expects that to come from advances in animal-less meat technology, and from the growing problems with production of food from animals. \u201cThe ace in the hole for the inevitability of the end of animal farming,\u201d he asserts, \u201cis the incredible inefficiency of making meat, dairy, and eggs from animals.\u201d That is, an animal\u2019s body does more than produce meat\u2014it builds bones and hair, it breathes and moves and senses, all of which consume energy, so that for every one calorie of meat produced, a farm animal takes in ten calories or more. Lab-grown meat doesn\u2019t perform any of these functions, of course, and so it has a much higher caloric conversion ratio than animals, which are, in Reese\u2019s words, \u201cinefficient producers of flesh.\u201d\n\nHe profiles some of the main companies in the meatless technology field, which he hopes will take clean meat mainstream. Hampton Creek, now called JUST, creates plant-based alternatives to eggs and dairy, and wants to target average consumers, not just vegans. Impossible Foods takes an analytical approach to isolating the components and characteristics of meat, and builds plant-based versions that have more in common with animal flesh than with the veggie burgers and Tofurkeys of yore. Beyond Meat makes products similar to those from Impossible Foods, but whereas Impossible Foods was initially marketed to restaurateurs like David Chang, Beyond Meat goes for the home cooks, selling to Whole Foods and other grocery chains.\n\nFor all these companies\u2019 efforts, Reese is also aware that changing people\u2019s diets and food cultures\u2014which foods they consider delicious or luxurious, or which they incorporate into traditional dishes\u2014is a deeply social project. He recognizes that advocates for animal-free food will need to work on social change, to ensure that as the technologies continue to develop (\u201cwhich seems fairly inevitable\u201d), people actually choose to eat the products. If scientists and businesses lead, recipes must follow.\n\nReese\u2019s book isn\u2019t likely to win the hearts and palates of many meat eaters. Its tone is coolly dry, bordering on mathematical. Part of this comes from Reese\u2019s commitment to effective altruism, whose adherents say they use \u201cevidence and careful analysis to find the very best causes\u201d rather than \u201cjust doing what feels right.\u201d It might be a refreshing shift in tone from the extreme compassion and occasional sanctimony that can surround arguments for animal welfare, and it\u2019s certainly a sensible way to organize the activities of an advocacy group\u2014but as the engine of a work of nonfiction, the constant emphasis on efficiency runs a little cold. Even Reese\u2019s discussion of suffering itself is mathematical, as he calculates the amount of harm a farm does by the number of animals it keeps and the number of hours they spend there, without accounting for differences in their consciousness. He gives the suffering of a fish the same weight as the suffering of a pig.\n\nYet despite its structure and tone, the book\u2019s underlying argument itself is important. Reese makes plain that eating meat causes an enormous amount of avoidable pain and suffering, and refuses to accept ignorance as an excuse. Most people have long known that farmed chickens live in tight wire cages where they go crazy with stress, or that hogs will get so depressed that they don\u2019t fight back when nearby animals bite their tails. People who know these facts and eat meat anyway (I do both) may tell ourselves that it\u2019s just the way things are, or cultivate an internal moral firewall, refusing to think about the processes that brought our protein to our plates.\n\nReese also rejects measures intended to make eating animals a little less morally objectionable. Michael Pollan has, for instance, envisioned not the abolition but the transformation of animal farming, into a system in which animals can live outdoors, \u201cin contact with the sun, the earth, and the gaze of the farmer,\u201d and in which consumers know where their meat comes from. A neat way to make the industrial meat system kinder, he thought, might begin with simple visibility: \u201cMaybe all we need to do to redeem industrial animal agriculture in this country,\u201d he wrote in The New York Times Magazine, \u201cis to pass a law requiring that the steel and concrete walls\u201d of the slaughterhouses \u201cbe replaced with \u2026 glass.\u201d Then, surely, conditions would have to improve. Why end the practice altogether when the cruelties can be eliminated?\n\nReese concedes that some smaller specialty farms might operate more ethically than the factory behemoths, but insists that exploiting sentient beings \u201cis a moral misdeed even if those sentient beings live happy lives.\u201d Most significantly, he argues that these specialty farms provide a \u201cpsychological refuge\u201d for meat eaters, who can take solace in the fact that they sometimes eat ethically farmed meat, even though most meat isn\u2019t produced this way. By occasionally choosing the \u201chappier\u201d meat option, people are able to imagine that their choices don\u2019t contribute to the big, brutal system, that the meatballs on their kitchen table have nothing to do with those shadowy stories about deranged chickens and terrified cows.\n\nAgain, he\u2019s right. Cruelty is all but impossible to eliminate from an industrialized meat-production system that prizes profitability above all else. Up to the 1940s and \u201950s, typical animal farms in the United States were pasture-based and raised various types of animals. Now they are concentrated operations\u2014the term of art for a factory farm is a \u201cconcentrated animal feeding operation,\u201d or CAFO. This consolidation has made it possible for Americans to eat more meat, more cheaply, and it has brought horrific conditions. The current system tasks workers with stunning live birds by dunking them in electrified water and docking the tails of pigs, in settings where the primary concern is keeping costs low. (Pollan pointed out that in ancient Greece, slaughter was entrusted to priests: \u201cpriests!\u2014now we entrust the job to minimum-wage workers.\u201d) In 2018, the average American ate more than 200 pounds of red meat and poultry, a record high. The way this plentiful meat is produced is simply hard to stomach.\n\nReading Reese\u2019s book, I found myself thinking of Matthew Scully\u2019s Dominion: The Power of Man, the Suffering of Animals, and the Call to Mercy, published in 2002. Like Reese, Scully describes the abuse of animals as a moral wrong, but unlike Reese, Scully\u2019s assessment is suffused with fellow-feeling. Scully comes to the issue as a Christian (though, by his own assessment, \u201cnot a particularly pious\u201d one) and as a conservative. And so it\u2019s surprising that his book also includes scathing critiques of capitalism throughout: \u201cMy copy of the Good Book doesn\u2019t say, \u2018Go forth to selleth every creature that moveth.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t say you can baiteth and slayeth and stuffeth every thing in sight, either, let alone deducteth the costs,\u201d he writes. He criticizes his fellow conservatives for their posture in animal-welfare conversations, for their \u201clazy disdain of moral inconveniences,\u201d and their belief \u201cthat somehow the free market will right all things and any cruelty will be redeemed by the miraculous workings of capitalism.\u201d And this from a man who worked as a speechwriter for George W. Bush.\n\nIt is something of this kind of fiery radicalism that I was hoping to find in Reese\u2019s book. His idea is radical. But The End of Animal Farming proceeds blandly through its points like a slide deck at a pitch meeting. Instead of critiquing the capitalist logic that gives us factory farming, Reese proposes replacing the meat business with another, more technically advanced model. And that\u2019s fine and sensible. But it seems unlikely that such a dispassionate approach will be enough to spark the major changes in eating habits and foodways that could bring about a slaughterless future. Reese\u2019s idea\u2014that people will give up something pleasurable and familiar without the spark of something deeply felt, be it shame or compassion\u2014relies on a very generous view of the human animal."

    "text": "Undercover officers solicited from Timbs, buying just under four grams of heroin for less than $400. He was arrested and charged with dealing a controlled substance and conspiracy to commit theft. Timbs pleaded guilty and received a six-year sentence to be served outside prison walls. The state also tried to seize his Land Rover, kicking off the legal battle that ultimately brought him to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe trial court refused to authorize the seizure. Indiana law only allowed a $10,000 fine for Timbs\u2019s sentence, and the court concluded that seizing a vehicle worth four times as much as that threshold would be \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d relative to Timbs\u2019s crime. The Indiana Court of Appeals upheld the decision after their own review of the circumstances. But the Indiana Supreme Court intervened and approved the seizure.\n\nThe judges\u2019 unanimous opinion rested on a precedent, or lack thereof: The U.S. Supreme Court has never applied the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Excessive Fines Clause to the states. Other lower courts have chosen to do so without waiting for the top justices, but Indiana\u2019s Supreme Court was uninterested in following that path for Timbs\u2019s benefit. \u201cIndiana is a sovereign state within our federal system, and we elect not to impose federal obligations on the State that the federal government itself has not mandated,\u201d the court declared.\n\nTimbs, with his petition in January, is now asking the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn that ruling. Doing so would require only a little bit of constitutional legerdemain on the high court\u2019s part. In the beginning, the Bill of Rights only constrained federal power over Americans. States were largely left to their own devices when protecting their own citizens\u2019 liberties. After the Civil War, Reconstruction\u2019s overhaul of the founding charter also rewrote the balance of power in favor of federal protections. The Supreme Court has spent the last century using the Fourteenth Amendment to apply the Bill of Rights to the states, amendment by amendment and clause by clause.\n\nThat process, known as selective incorporation, is now almost complete. The most recent advance came in 2010, when the Supreme Court ruled in McDonald v. Chicago that the Second Amendment right to bear arms also applied to the states. Justice Samuel Alito noted in his majority opinion that the court had yet to weigh in on incorporating only two portions of the Bill of Rights: the Third Amendment\u2019s ban on peacetime quartering of troops in private homes, and the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of excessive fines."

    "text": "Undercover Indiana police officers eventually arrested Timbs for trying to buy less than four grams of heroin for $400. Timbs received a six-year suspended sentence for the crime, saving him from a stint behind bars, but the police tried to seize his Land Rover. Timbs challenged the seizure in court, arguing that the confiscation of a $42,000 vehicle for a few grams of heroin violated the Constitution\u2019s ban on excessive fines. The Indiana Supreme Court disagreed, ruling that the U.S. Supreme Court had never held that the Excessive Fines Clause applies to state governments. Timbs then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to change that.\n\nIn their original form, the Bill of Rights only applied to the federal government: In other words, the federal government couldn\u2019t restrict freedom of speech or right to bear arms, but the states could. Over the last century, however, the Supreme Court has used a legal doctrine known as selective incorporation to apply the Bill of Rights\u2019 protections to state and local governments as well\u2014amendment by amendment, clause by clause. The most recent incorporation came in 2010\u2019s McDonald v. Chicago when the justices ruled that the Second Amendment right to individual gun ownership also bound state legislatures and city councils.\n\nIndiana Solicitor General Thomas Fisher, who had the unenviable task of arguing for Indiana\u2019s right to confiscate Land Rovers on Wednesday, only managed to utter two sentences before Justice Neil Gorsuch interrupted him. \u201cGeneral,\u201d he asked, \u201ccan we just get one thing off the table? We all agree that the Excessive Fines Clause is incorporated against the states.\u201d That assertion did not bode well for Indiana, since the question presented to the court for its consideration is literally \u201cwhether the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Excessive Fines Clause is incorporated against the states under the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d\n\nIt only got worse for the state from there. After briefly recounting the Anglo-American legal tradition\u2019s long history of skepticism towards excessive fines, the justice pressed his point again. \u201cWell, whatever the Excessive Fine Clause guarantees\u2014we can argue, again, about its scope\u2014but whatever it in fact is, it applies against the states, right?\u201d Gorsuch asked. Indiana\u2019s solicitor general declined to give a straight answer. \u201cWell, again, that depends,\u201d Fisher replied. \u201cI mean,\u201d Gorsuch answered, \u201cmost of the incorporation cases took place in, like, the 1940s, and here we are in 2018 still litigating incorporation of the Bill of Rights. Really? Come on, General.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make this vehicle somehow like a pirate ship that had been sailing the high seas.\u201d\n\nOther justices chimed in. \u201cIsn\u2019t it just too late in the day to argue that any [part] of the Bill of Rights is not incorporated?\u201d Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked Fisher. The court\u2019s newest member had a point: The Excessive Fines Clause is one of only four provisions in the Bill of Rights not currently held against the states. Indiana took fire on its left flank as well. Justice Sonia Sotomayor implicitly compared seizures like the one against Timbs to the Star Chamber, a medieval English court that universally represents injustice in the American legal mind."

    "text": "The long-running intimacy between tech and the Defense Department has not gone unchallenged. In the 1970s, for example, Computer People for Peace protested the Vietnam War from within Silicon Valley, targeting Honeywell Aerospace for manufacturing fragmentation bombs augmented to kill humans, and IBM for what the activists called \u201ccorporate racism.\u201d (The company was trying to expand its business into apartheid South Africa.) But Computer People for Peace only ever had a few hundred members. It is hard not to feel that tech\u2019s complicity with the military is too deep to be undone, the ties too strong to be broken. And it\u2019s difficult to predict the prospects of this nascent opposition. Some of the movement\u2019s energy may result from having an antagonist in the White House. \u201cWhen you\u2019re watching the news and seeing family separation at the border and realize your company works with ICE, that doesn\u2019t feel good,\u201d one woman, who used to organize the tech sector, told me. If a Democratic president takes office, or these images go away, it seems at least conceivable that the walkouts, protests, and petitions will disappear, too.\n\nBut at least one organizer I spoke to (on condition of anonymity) did not think so. \u201cIf Trump got impeached tomorrow,\u201d the Google employee told me, \u201cwe\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d His efforts would outlast Trump, he believed, because Trump was not their sole object. A Democratic president will also use technology to wage war on other nations and police our own. As the Google worker cast it, the opposition is to state violence broadly conceived, not merely a particular defense contract at a particular company. Some of the efforts aren\u2019t even focused on American policies; Google employees have, for instance, objected to Chinese censorship.\n\nMore likely than the possibility of losing momentum after Trump is gone is the possibility that some of the first organizers will leave their companies for different ventures. At Google, some have already resigned in protest, and more could follow; in Silicon Valley, engineers change jobs frequently. A strong union might once have funneled new leaders in behind the first generation, but the organizing against state-sponsored violence has happened on its own. Still, strong internal networks are forming within these companies, along with groups like Tech Workers Coalition, Tech Action, and Tech Solidarity, which are springing up across the country to call protests, hold meetings, and build up a leadership pipeline. These groups offer the beginnings of a kind of infrastructure that unions provide in other industries. Should momentum continue to build, they might even be in a position to organize a strike. In an industry where talent is scarce, strikes could cripple operations.\n\nCompany executives will never voluntarily forgo profits. Even as Google was conceding on Project Maven, praising its employees publicly for working to \u201ccreate a better workplace,\u201d in private the company was urging the government to narrow legal protections for workers\u2019 organizing. If Google gets its way, it could legally punish anyone who used company email to organize protests, circulate petitions, or form a union. (Google told Bloomberg in January that the limitations were floated as just one possible strategy in a legal brief filed to the National Labor Relations Board.) Even so, what organizers have already been able to achieve is significant, and the tech industry as a whole is so powerful that its choices reverberate loudly. A strong internal revolt may lead, eventually, to policy changes on questions of war and surveillance. A few years from now, engineers may be organizing with those who work the supply lines, from warehouses to the cobalt mines of the Global South, and with those directly touched by the implacable force of the state."

    "text": "Conservatives have obsessed over Warren\u2019s Native American claim because it allows them to attack two foes at once. They\u2019re using it not only to discredit Warren herself\u2014an accomplished intellectual with an impressive academic and political career\u2014but also the very legitimacy of affirmative action. The idea is that Warren only got ahead in the professional world by fraudulently taking advantage of a liberal policy.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy would Warren pretend to be an American Indian in the 1980s if later she downplayed the matter as a misunderstanding based on family lore?\u201d James J. Robbins wrote in USA Today on Thursday. \u201cFairly obviously it was for career advancement. Despite the current leftist mania to call out supposed \u2018white privilege,\u2019 the fact is that even in the 1980s minority status could confer distinct advantages in hiring and promotion in career fields dominated by liberals for whom affirmative action is an article of faith.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd yet, there\u2019s no evidence that Warren claimed minority status for preferential treatment. She has been remarkably consistent about her background. While she never belonged to any of the three federally recognized Cherokee tribes, she has always described her mother as \u201cpart Cherokee\u201d and said she learned of this heritage through her family\u2019s oral tradition. The most recent iteration of the scandal, involving Warren\u2019s Texas bar card, supports this. The information on that card was private; Warren would not gain any advantage from listing herself as Native American. Even the aforementioned Post story eventually gets around to that truth, albeit not until the eighteenth paragraph:\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no indication that Warren gained professionally by reporting herself as Native American on the card. Above the lines for race, national origin and handicap status, the card says, \u201cThe following information is for statistical purposes only and will not be disclosed to any person or organization without the express written consent of the attorney.\u201d\n\nThere is a scandal here, it\u2019s just not the one the right\u2014and, too often, the mainstream media\u2014is talking about. In October, Warren released the results of a DNA test that showed \u201cstrong evidence,\u201d a geneticist said, of Native American ancestry \u201c6-10 generations ago.\u201d She was rightly criticized for doing so. As The New York Times\u2019s Astead Herndon reported two months later, the move \u201ctroubled advocates of racial equality and justice, who say her attempt to document ethnicity with a DNA test gave validity to the idea that race is determined by blood\u2014a bedrock principle for white supremacists and others who believe in racial hierarchies.\u201d\n\n\n\nWarren, to her credit, has apologized for the DNA test. But the story continues to roll on. Despite admitting several times that Warren never received any advantages from identifying as Native American\u2014the core of the right\u2019s argument against her\u2014CNN nevertheless declared that \u201cElizabeth Warren\u2019s Native Problem just got even worse\u201d after the Texas bar story dropped. But that revelation didn\u2019t change what we already knew. All it did was give the media yet another reason to assert that her Native American claim is haunting her presidential campaign."

But Cernovich is right. Americans increasingly recognize that the world needs to decarbonize quickly. To prevent the planet from warming by 2 degrees Celsius, which many scientists consider the tipping point, the world must become carbon neutral by 2070. How can it meet that goal without the kind of massive government intervention that the Green New Deal proposes? I put that question to the plan\u2019s critics.\n\nThe Green New Deal is based on the idea that the only way to solve a problem as enormous as climate change is to change the way society works: to reform American capitalism itself. That\u2019s why, in addition to transitioning the country to 100 percent renewable energy and installing a high-speed rail system to reduce our reliance on cars, Ocasio-Cortez and Markey\u2019s resolution calls for universal health care, a federal job guarantee program, and affordable housing for all. It also says the public should have \u201can appropriate ownership stake\u201d in the achievements of the Green New Deal.\n\nThe latter policies are what bother Joseph Majkut, the director of climate policy at the Niskanen Center, a think tank that describes itself as a group of \u201cglobalists\u201d who support \u201ceconomic and social inequality\u201d but also a \u201cbelief in the wealth creating power of free markets.\u201d \u201c[The Green New Deal] is a whole portfolio of things that aren\u2019t necessarily aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand the perspective that this is supposed to be a reorganization of the social and political economic order, and climate is a part of that. But to me it feels like climate is just one part of this larger progressive reorganization of society.\u201d\n\nMajkut and the Niskanen Center argue that a federal climate plan should stick to climate-specific policies. He advocates for a nationwide carbon tax; investment in \u201cadvanced research and development\u201d for reducing carbon emissions from industry and agriculture; more government subsidies for low-carbon energy sources like wind and solar; and stricter efficiency rules on buildings.\n\nBut will those policies be enough to achieve net-zero carbon emissions within several decades? Majkut said he\u2019s not sure, but added that he\u2019s not sure how the Green New Deal would do it, either. \u201cI don\u2019t see how having Medicare for All makes it easier to achieve decarbonization,\u201d he said."

    "text": "There may be no moment where it\u2019s more important to have a cleric of one\u2019s faith than at the moment of one\u2019s death. Ray, who was a devout Muslim, asked if his imam could be present instead. The state said no. He asked if the minister could be excluded from the execution chamber. The state refused that request as well. Five days after the meeting, on January 28, Ray filed a lawsuit in federal court to halt his execution. He argued that the prison\u2019s policy violated federal religious-discrimination laws as well as the First Amendment\u2019s Establishment Clause, which forbids government officials from elevating one faith or denomination above another.\n\n\n\nAlabama responded by citing the court\u2019s need to maintain prison safety and control who is present during an execution. The state also waived its requirement that the prison chaplain be present in the execution chamber when officials administered a lethal injection to Ray. But this merely changed the discrimination instead of curing it: A Protestant Christian prisoner would still be able to have a cleric of their faith by their side when they died, while those from other denominations and faiths would not.\n\nThe district court denied Ray\u2019s appeal on timeliness grounds on February 1. Ray had told the court he only learned about the policy five days before he filed the lawsuit, and Alabama offered no evidence to the contrary. Despite this, the judge ruled that Ray should have filed the complaint after the state set the execution date in November. On Wednesday, a three-judge panel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals overruled that decision and stayed Ray\u2019s execution until it could gather more evidence. Judge Stanley Marcus wrote that \u201cit looks substantially likely to us that Alabama has run afoul of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority, in quashing the panel\u2019s stay on Thursday and letting the state of Alabama kill Ray hours later, offered no explanation beyond a short, unsigned statement that cited the late timing of the appeal. So it\u2019s unclear why they ruled as they did. But Kagan\u2019s dissent shows how they made three unjustifiable decisions along the way. First, the majority didn\u2019t just let the execution go ahead on schedule; they squelched the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s effort to find out more facts before rendering a final judgment. \u201cThe Eleventh Circuit wanted to hear that claim in full,\u201d Kagan explained. \u201cInstead, this Court short-circuits that ordinary process\u2014and itself rejects the claim with little briefing and no argument\u2014just so the State can meet its preferred execution date.\u201d In doing so, the majority sent the message that the convenience of state officials ranks higher than the religious-freedom claims of a condemned prisoner.\n\nSecond, the majority did not acknowledge that Alabama had come nowhere near proving its case. The state had to justify its religious discrimination by proving it had exhausted all other options when pursuing the \u201ccompelling interest\u201d of prison security; it did not. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t Ray\u2019s imam receive whatever training in execution protocol the Christian chaplain received?\u201d Kagan asked in her dissent. \u201cThe State has no answer. Why wouldn\u2019t it be sufficient for the imam to pledge, under penalty of contempt, that he will not interfere with the State\u2019s ability to perform the execution? The State doesn\u2019t say.\u201d Nor does the majority, which stuck to the procedural aspects of the case."

    ],
    "text": "\u201cAll signs suggest that Rubio has assumed an increasingly prominent role in shaping conversations in and out of the White House about U.S. policy toward Latin America,\u201d said Michael Bustamante, a professor of Latin American history at Florida International University in Miami. \u201cThe question that\u2019s on everybody\u2019s mind is whether Venezuela is the first step, and if they\u2019ll move onto Cuba as the next target.\u201d\n\nFrom an early age, Rubio admired the politics of first-generation Cubans who crossed the Straits of Florida on shrimp fishing boats and wooden rafts in 1960s, \u201970s, and \u201980s. He began his career working with staunchly pro-embargo politicians, like Cuban-born Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen from Miami. Because of his old-school conservative politics and boyish looks, some Spanish-language media outlets have described Rubio as un joven viejo\u2014a young fogey. \u201cRubio is very much a product of West Miami politics, a small, mostly blue-collar, reliably Republican municipality in the greater Miami area,\u201d said Ricardo Herrero, who directs Cuba Study Group, a pro-engagement organization of Cuban-American business leaders.\n\nAs a voting bloc, Cuban exiles in Miami have formed a near-unified stance against the Cuban government and in support for the embargo, in the hopes that it will one day bring down the Communist Party. \u201cMiami has often been a place where those who find themselves in the crosshairs of left-leaning Latin American governments end up,\u201d said Michael Bustamante, a professor of Cuban history at Florida International University in Miami. \u201cThere\u2019s a long tradition in the Cuban exile community of seeing like-minded left-leaning governments in the hemisphere, particularly those that are closest to Havana, as enemies.\u201d\n\nWhile many second- and third-generation Cuban-Americans identify as Democrats and support an end to the embargo on Cuba, their parents, especially elites who lost property or had family members imprisoned during Cuban Revolution, remain steadfast in their hardline stance, which extends to Venezuela. \u201cThe triumph of the Castro Revolution in 1959 dispersed a lot of right-wing elements into the United States and injected the right with a new kind of constituency, Cuban \u00e9migr\u00e9s,\u201d said Grandin, the professor of Latin American history at NYU. Today 67 percent of Cuban Americans in Miami between ages 60 and 75 support the embargo, while only 35 percent of Cuban adults under age 40 do , according to the Florida International University\u2019s 2018 Cuba Poll. \u201c[West Miami] is one of the few pockets here where taking a hardline stand against Cuba still yields electoral rewards,\u201d said Herrero. \u201cAnd Venezuela is really an extension of the position on Cuba.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, fifteen miles west of Miami, the affluent city of Doral, Florida\u2014which some call \u201cDoralzuela\u201d for its growing population of Venezuelan exiles\u2014is a hub of support for U.S.-backed regime change in Venezuela. In Doral, it\u2019s common to see Venezuelan flags and bumper stickers with the message \u201cPray for Venezuela.\u201d On February 1, Vice President Mike Pence, a close ally of Rubio\u2019s, traveled to Doral to speak to Venezuelans about ending Maduro\u2019s rule. \u201cThis is no time for dialogue,\u201d said Pence to a cheering crowd of Venezuelan exiles at a church. \u201cIt is time to end the Maduro regime.\u201d\n\nSince August 2017, when news broke that a powerful lawyer in Caracas had plotted an assassination attempt on Rubio, the Florida senator says he has talked to Trump at least once a month about Venezuela. He has reminded him of the payoffs in Florida in 2020 for supporting regime change: \u201cThere could be electoral rewards,\u201d Rubio recently told the Associated Press.\n\n\u201c[Rubio] has been relentless ... working hard to earn the president\u2019s trust in this policy area,\u201d former Representative Carlos Curbelo, a Florida Republican, told The New York Times. \u201cHe owns it and it has clearly paid dividends for him.\u201d\n\nIn order to win Florida in 2020 and by extension a second term in the White House, Trump must turn out Cuban and Venezuelan voters. In the 2018 midterms, only 31 percent of Latino voters in Miami cast ballots for Democratic candidates. Older Cuban-Americans tend to vote for politicians with the most conservative stances on relations with Cuba and Venezuela. \u201cForeign policy is domestic policy in South Florida,\u201d Democratic Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who lives in south Florida, recently said.\n\nAside from short-term electoral gains, Trump himself appears to care little about what happens in Latin America. That is not the case for Rubio. After taking office in 2017, Trump payed lip service to Cuban-American voters by taking rhetorical rather than substantive steps to roll back relations with Cuba. U.S. businesses with investments in Cuba wanted to keep the relationship open, and Trump understood this. (At one point, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts scouted land in Havana.) But Rubio was not satisfied. In recent months, he has pressured the White House to put Cuba back on an international terrorism list, impose sanctions on Cuban officials, and end U.S. travel and academic exchanges to the island. Last year, at Rubio\u2019s urging, the United States withdrew most of its diplomats from Cuba. The real feather in his cap will be if the Maduro government falls in Venezuela, which could have devastating effects on Cuba, since it relies on subsidized oil from Venezuela.\n\n\n\nWith Trump bowing to his wishes, Rubio has also started exerting his influence on other Pink Tide countries. Starting in 1999 with Hugo Chavez\u2019s ascent to power in Venezuela, there was a leftward turn in Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Uruguay, Honduras, and Ecuador. Until a right-wing lurch in the mid-2010s, these governments rode a commodities boom, increasing public welfare spending and lowering Latin America\u2019s poverty rate from 45 to 25 percent between 2000 and 2014.\n\nIn 2019 only a few leftist governments remain. Rubio\u2019s agenda has disquieting parallels to the Cold War years when the United States supported the removal of governments in eight countries across the region, ushering in a wave of dictators in their stead. Despite Rubio\u2019s opposition to socialist governments on the grounds of human rights violations, he has praised authoritarian right-wing leaders, such as Brazil\u2019s new president, Jair Bolsonaro, a military strongman who has extolled dictatorship, joked about raping women and killing civilians, and called for the wide-scale deforestation of the Amazon. In January Rubio penned an op-ed for CNN.com with the headline \u201cU.S. Should Go Big on Brazil.\u201d\n\nOver the past year, Rubio has directed U.S. policy on a range of smaller issues affecting the region. In May, in his role on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he suspended funding for Guatemala\u2019s anti-corruption commission, CICIG, which was investigating right-wing President Jimmy Morales, his sons, and his brother on accounts of fraud and corruption. In October, he handpicked Mauricio Claver-Carone, a prominent contributor at the conservative blog Capitol Hill Cubans and a pro-embargo lobbyist, to lead the department of Western Hemisphere affairs at the National Security Council. In August, he boasted on Twitter about drafting legislation to cut off aid to El Salvador for moving its embassy from Taiwan to China. On February 6, Foreign Policy reported that Rubio convinced the Trump administration to abandon its nomination of career diplomat Francisco \u201cPaco\u201d Palmieri as ambassador to Honduras, insisting that his politics were not hardline enough. On February 8, Rubio condemned Mexico for continuing to recognize Maduro as president of Venezuela.\n\nThese activities paint a picture of Rubio\u2019s vision for Latin America\u2014a return to Cold War policy. There\u2019s a long history of the U.S. meddling in Latin American affairs to assert U.S. hegemony, and it tells us that what comes next could be bloody and ultimately transformational for the region. How far Rubio is able to push his agenda hinges, most pressingly, on his success in Venezuela."

Swaigen was wary of Vice\u2019s flashy ethos, and left feeling dubious about the project.\n\nIt was FuckJerry that had hyped up the festival into an Instagram craze, using mysterious orange squares to tease its announcement.\n\nAt this point, Swaigen recalled, \u201cthere was no talk of FuckJerry\u201d being involved in Vice\u2019s film. It was FuckJerry that had hyped up the festival into an Instagram craze, using mysterious orange squares to tease its announcement. According to the Hulu documentary, FuckJerry was aware of the problems in the festival\u2019s production, but proceeded full steam ahead anyway. A source from Vice explained that the Vice/Smith team collectively approached Jerry Media for footage in December 2017, which Netflix also confirmed.\n\nAfter the Vice office visit, Swaigen returned to California, where he met with Ja Rule, the foremost celebrity involved in Fyre Festival, to find out his angle on the post-Fyre landscape. Ja Rule mentioned that Hulu was in talks to make a documentary. Swaigen emailed the filmmaker Jenner Furst a photograph of himself with McFarland, and Furst replied immediately. \u201cIt just felt better than anything that I had been through with [Vice],\u201d Swaigen said.\n\nThe key difference between the Hulu project and the Vice project, Swaigen said, was that \u201cit didn\u2019t feel like anything shady.\u201d At this point, Swaigen was \u201cspying with integrity,\u201d in his words, feeding information about the Vice documentary back to the other camp. In a statement, Cinemart, the company that produced Hulu\u2019s Fyre Fraud, told me that \u201cMichael was a big part of this story and his investigation during the aftermath of the festival was really insightful. We are grateful that Michael took everything into consideration when deciding who he would work with and that he ultimately chose to work with us.\u201d\n\nIn January of 2018, Swaigen met with Mick Purzycki, who had been busy rebranding FuckJerry as a media \u201cstudio\u201d through its subsidiary Jerry Media. The new studio\u2019s first project was Fyre, which was FuckJerry\u2019s first ever film production. Purzycki was by now a producer of the documentary; Swaigen speculates that he managed to finagle that role because Purzycki had direct knowledge of the Fyre debacle and could possibly negotiate an appearance from McFarland.\n\nBy February of 2018, Swaigen says, Bluestone and Fitzgerald had stopped talking to him. Furthermore, there was \u201cno more talk of Vice\u201d from director Chris Smith or Purzycki. Gabrielle Bluestone remains one of the documentary\u2019s executive producers, but Purzycki told Swaigen that Vice was \u201ckind of still involved in this peripheral sense, but Chris\u2019s production company is running the team. And we\u2019re Jerry Media now,\u201d according to Swaigen.\n\nAfter early screenings at Cannes in May 2018, Smith took Fyre to Netflix, which announced its acquisition of Fyre on December 10. Netflix said that the movie was directed by Smith, and that the executive producers were Elliot Tebele and James Ohliger from Jerry Media; Gabrielle Bluestone of Vice; and Max Pollack, Matthew Rowean, and Brett Kincaid of Matte Projects. So by the time of Netflix\u2019s announcement, the producer list had become dominated by personnel from companies contracted directly by Fyre Festival: The show was run by Matte Projects (Swaigen\u2019s employer, which owned most of the behind-the-scenes footage you see in Fyre) and Jerry Media itself. Although the Vice logo appears in the movie\u2019s credits, the company seems to have been edged out.\n\nJa Rule and Billy McFarland, during the Fyre Festival commercial shoot. Michael Swaigen/Cinemart\n\nFuckJerry has some serious answering to do related to its involvement in Fyre Festival. The company released a statement saying that \u201call actions taken by Jerry Media were done at the direction of the Fyre Festival,\u201d suggesting that it was just as innocent as the scammed ticket-holders. But as several journalists have observed, none of the tickets would ever have been sold if it hadn\u2019t been for FuckJerry\u2019s efforts to spam social media with Fyre\u2019s false advertisements. Furthermore, former FuckJerry employee Oren Aks has said that the company was aware of Fyre Festival\u2019s problems far earlier than it has claimed, and therefore needs to be held accountable in Billy McFarland\u2019s fraud.\n\nOf course, Jerry Media denies such accusations. But the accusations at least appeared in the Cinemart/Hulu documentary, which has no vested interest in exonerating any parties involved; they did not appear in the Netflix documentary, which was co-produced by the CEO of Jerry Media and several other FuckJerry staffers, including its founder Elliot Tebele, who is now receiving an intense backlash for plagiarizing other creatives\u2019 content, led by the social media hashtag #FuckFuckJerry. In fact, Fyre posits that the blame was solely McFarland\u2019s. Those facts alone are strong evidence that Fyre is partially a cover-up, shot and edited to conceal FuckJerry\u2019s mistakes under garish anecdotes about blowjobs-for-Evian. Furthermore, in an email to Michael Swaigen sent by Mick Purzycki dated March 25, 2018, he wrote: \u201cI have final cut on the film and will not be approving anything that is not done with integrity.\u201d\n\n\n\nThose facts alone are strong evidence that Fyre is partially a cover-up, shot and edited to conceal FuckJerry\u2019s mistakes under garish anecdotes about blowjobs-for-Evian.\n\nNetflix disputed Purzycki\u2019s \u201cfinal cut\u201d claim, telling me that \u201cJerry Media did not have final cut. There was an initial agreement that either party could walk away at any point and retain the rights to what they came into the project with. This was superseded by the distribution agreement where the final cut was with the director.\u201d Purzycki confirmed that he sent the email to Swaigen, but that eventually \u201call production companies ultimately agreed that final cut belonged to the director and the distributor of the film.\u201d (Purzycki also told me that McFarland was originally supposed to appear in the Netflix movie, according to a deal cut with Jerry Media for 12 percent of the film\u2019s backend revenue to pay back ticket-holders, but he failed to show up at the last minute.** Vice confirmed the proposed arrangement, undermining Smith\u2019s accusations of unethical behavior by Hulu.)\n\nBut whoever was in the room when that final cut was made, FuckJerry was still heavily involved. Purzycki has pivoted the old, tainted brand to video, dressing it up in the credibility of names like Netflix and Vice. These companies have been used, in effect, as the washing machine through which FuckJerry (and Matte, to some extent) laundered its involvement in a catastrophe.\n\nFyre Festival was the kind of international news flashpoint that encourages us to draw conclusions about the times we\u2019re living in, but we\u2019ve been failing to connect the dots between the festival and the coverage that has followed it. It\u2019s scary to think about how Fyre Festival would have been portrayed if Hulu hadn\u2019t rushed its movie out. The great thing about twin films is that, through different treatments, the competing accounts end up pointing the viewer toward the truth. Fyre Festival is a story about insidious digital marketing, corporate irresponsibility, and the misdeeds of a handful of men who control the images that appear on your social media and shape your opinions. They are doing it again, just under a different name.\n\n*An earlier version of this article stated that Brendan Fitzgerald \u201cfounded\u201d Viceland, and dropped out of the Fyre Festival documentary. He launched Viceland as its head of development, and left Vice altogether during the making of the documentary.\n\n**An earlier version of this article stated that McFarland had reached an agreement with Jerry Media to appear in Fyre in exchange for revenue to pay McFarland\u2019s debts. The agreement stipulated the revenue would pay back ticket-holders who had been scammed."

    "text": "Like many tech CEOs of the current era, Bezos counted on his mission statement inspiring and lifting up his employees with the sense that they were transforming the world for the better. What the protests make apparent, however, is that it also instilled in them a sense of responsibility, even guilt. Bezos is learning what many tech executives have learned over the past year: that a mission statement only commands loyalty when employees believe it is being consistently upheld; that when they see that it isn\u2019t, they will use it as reason to foment dissent, to strike, to leave.\n\nGoogle\u2019s ideals were famously articulated in the 2000s with the shorthand \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d (those three words appear in Google\u2019s 2004 IPO filing), but its stated mission, first laid out by founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1998, is far more concrete: to \u201corganize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful.\u201d In 2014, Page considered revising this formulation of the company\u2019s goals. After all, Google was no longer just \u201corganizing the world\u2019s information\u201d; it had expanded its operations into self-driving cars and experiments in biotechnology. But Page decided against a change, and that original mission statement has come to haunt them.\n\n\u201cEmployees at Google have been fairly vocal about making sure that the company upholds its pledge to not be evil,\u201d Liz Fong-Jones, an engineer on Google\u2019s Cloud Platform, told Fast Company last year. In 2016, she was among 2,800 tech workers at Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and other companies who signed a pledge not to work on software that assisted discriminatory policies like President Donald Trump\u2019s Muslim ban. When news broke last year that Google was planning to create a censored search engine called Dragonfly for use in China, they once again criticized the company for failing to live up to its values. How was a censored search engine, they asked, making information \u201cuniversally accessible\u201d?\n\n\u201cOur mission is to serve everyone,\u201d Google\u2019s CEO Sundar Pichai said at an event in November. His explanation was a subtle but profound redescription of Google\u2019s stated goals. According to him, the point was not to make information \u201cuniversally accessible,\u201d but to make Google itself universally available, even if the information it provides is censored. What Pichai was doing wasn\u2019t unusual. Corporate mission statements are cooked up in C-suites, and CEOs can\u2014and often do\u2014change how they are interpreted. Perhaps predictably, though, Pichai\u2019s comments failed to placate his employees, and protests over Dragonfly continued. Google was finding out what it meant to possess a mission with real content, one that isn\u2019t full of \u201cbizspeak and bromides,\u201d as a 2007 New York Times article described the vast majority of statements. The more technical the mission, the more likely it can be wielded as a tool to organize employees against leadership.\n\nIn its early years, Facebook articulated its goals in much the same way as Google. At an event for developers in 2007, Mark Zuckerberg spoke of wanting to \u201chelp users share more information,\u201d a phrase that echoed Google\u2019s aims of making information \u201caccessible to everyone.\u201d But whereas Google\u2019s language remained the same over the years, Facebook\u2019s evolved to become more communally and socially oriented. In 2009, Facebook\u2019s goal was to \u201cmake the world more open and connected,\u201d but by 2017, the company had changed it to giving people \u201cthe power to build community and bring the world closer together.\u201d"

    ],
    "text": "He is so unpresidential that when he meets the minimum requirements of decency, he is praised as if he has done something consequential. When he addressed a joint session of Congress early in his presidency, he managed to read his prepared speech from a teleprompter without the bluster that characterized his campaign rallies or press conferences, and at one point honored the wife of a slain Navy seal. \u201cHe became president of the United States in that moment, period,\u201d CNN\u2019s Van Jones declared. No matter that the speech contained outright falsehoods about immigration, crime, welfare, the federal budget, and that it overstated the impact the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines would have on job creation (not to mention the disastrous environmental impact and displacement of indigenous people). What mattered was his presentation. Trump briefly sounded like a president. That should not have been enough. But for a moment it was.\n\nThe Resistance is not about whether one agrees or disagrees with Trump on the issues, whatever those may be. It is not about policy. It is about the threat that Trump poses to the idea of progress, the comforting notion, entrenched by the election of Barack Obama, that things in this country could get better without anyone having to give anything up to make that so. When Trump refuses to denounce white supremacist groups that have endorsed him, the issue becomes less that his beliefs line up with theirs, and more that he has not rhetorically separated himself from avowed white supremacists. It becomes embarrassing to witness him on a global stage push past other world leaders so that he can be in front of a photo-op. His sophomoric speaking style is far below the level of what presidents are supposed to be able to employ. He watches television compulsively and live tweets his favorite Fox News shows. He refuses to release his tax returns to be reviewed by the American people. He is deeply incurious and proudly so, refusing to sit for traditional presidential briefs or to read anything that doesn\u2019t mention him by name. During a ceremony to reintroduce the National Space Council, he responded to Buzz Aldrin\u2019s sarcastic exclamation of \u201cInfinity and beyond!\u201d by saying, \u201cIt could be infinity. We don\u2019t really don\u2019t know. But it could be. It has to be something\u2014but it could be infinity, right?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not good to have someone with so little interest in knowledge as president, someone who flaunts his ignorance as a badge of populist pride. And that is the dilemma the Resistance faces in exercising any meaningful political power. Trump has defied the norms and expectations of the presidency, and American politics more generally, and succeeded. The Resistance has made heroes of those who have pointed this out. But it has not questioned the basic nature of the presidency, or the country. It is dangerous to believe there is some victory in removing one person from an oppressive system while leaving the system intact. This is a dynamic the Resistance has shown no interest in addressing. Until it does, it can never be a movement.\n\nThere is a gross underestimation of how norms produced the Trump presidency. The Electoral College is an American norm. Placating racist voters is the norm, and cuts across both parties. Distrust and disdain for women in positions of power is the norm. Executive orders that overstep the constitutional powers granted to the presidency are now the norm. Some norms need to be challenged. America\u2019s liberals have only been willing to challenge them to the extent that they do not uncomfortably burden its ruling classes with drastic calls for change. The Resistance has reflected that stance. It is the major impediment to consolidating this would-be movement around an agenda worth fighting for. Even if the principal objective is the removal of Trump from office, what drives that cannot be a desire for a return to what was once defined as normal. That would only set the stage for another Trump to rise. The goal has to be a complete reconsideration of the American system of governance.\n\nResistance is a reactive state of mind,\u201d Michelle Alexander wrote in The New York Times. \u201cWhile it can be necessary for survival and to prevent catastrophic harm, it can also tempt us to set our sights too low and to restrict our field of vision to the next election cycle, leading us to forget our ultimate purpose and place in history.\u201d Viewed this way, the word resistance itself provides the wrong framework for understanding what must be done. James Baldwin refused to say the \u201cCivil Rights Movement\u201d because it was a term applied by white media onlookers. He instead referred to the period of heightened activism in the 1950s and \u201960s as the \u201clatest slave rebellion.\u201d The contrast in meaning is stark. The enslaved possess no rights to be protected, only a system of dehumanization and exploitation to rebel against. Phrasing it this way captures a very different, very dire political terrain, one that requires a higher level of militancy to effectively counter.\n\nThe Resistance is something else entirely. Its active distancing from militancy reveals as much. On January 20, 2017, the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration, thousands of protesters in Washington, D.C., took part in a different kind of demonstration than the one that would follow the next day during the Women\u2019s March. Two hundred and thirty-four people would be arrested and face charges including felony inciting to riot, conspiracy to riot, rioting, and destruction of property. The J20 march, as it came to be known, was not just anti-Trump but anti-capitalist and anti-fascist. Its participants left a trail of thrown objects and smashed windows. Police teargassed and arrested them.\n\nThese protesters were roundly denounced by those who supported the next day\u2019s events. Indeed, the virtual absence of arrests among the estimated 500,000 to one million people at the Women\u2019s March in D.C. (or among demonstrators at any of the other sites across the country) the next day was heralded as a sign of its success. These were peaceful participants in democratic action, unlike the rabble-rousers of J20.\n\nThere is something immensely powerful about orchestrating the largest single-day march in the history of this country, as the Women\u2019s March is believed to be. Many of its participants had previously never attended a march or thought of themselves as actively political. But there is also something shortsighted about not simultaneously embracing the J20 protesters. Those repelled by their tactics see only destruction and chaos, rather than the inevitable direct confrontation of state power\u2014inevitable if there is a goal past the removal of Trump. The two years of his presidency have shown that he is a uniquely dangerous president, but his ascent was made possible by entrenched interests that predate him. He is only the latest representative.\n\nConfrontational resistance is justified because conventional processes can only do so much to mitigate harm. Voting, in particular, is effective only to the point that it is understood that the citizenry will forcefully dissent from governance if its will is not honored. But it must also be understood that the problems Trump represents do not only exist at the state level. What is now called the \u201calt-right\u201d has been organizing itself, in the shadows, for decades. Its adherents have developed alternative information channels, formed online communities, adopted a common language, and mobilized in ways that have found a home in the Republican Party.\n\nTheir agenda is best understood in the simplest terms: white supremacy. And yet they have been treated with an inordinate amount of benign curiosity, as if they present some fresh ideological viewpoint worthy of consideration in what is, in name, a multiracial democracy. Profiles of their supposedly dapper media leaders have portrayed them as fairly innocuous.\n\nBut as the killing of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville in August 2017 showed, the violence of white supremacy is both broader and deeper than the apparatus of the state under Trump. The young men photographed clad in polos and khakis, carrying torches and yelling \u201cJews will not replace us!\u201d are not minor actors in a political game. They are a vicious threat.\n\nThe Resistance has not settled on an adequate response to this threat. Months before Heyer was killed, the alt-right provocateur Richard Spencer made headlines, not for his inflammatory rhetoric, but for being the subject of a viral video in which an antifa activist punched him in the face. The violence was decried, in some circles, as the wrong approach to his growing influence. It was also suggested by some liberal voices that other tactics, like protesting paid speaking engagements for the likes of Milo Yiannopoulos and Steve Bannon, were also outside the bounds of civility and proper discourse. Better to expose their ideas and debate them with a superior vision of an American future.\n\nThis misjudges the extent of their appeal, the composition of their threat, and naively places faith in the American populace that it will reject nativist, xenophobic, racist ideologies for their core maliciousness. There is less progress on that front than many would like to believe.\n\nIt also presumes that alt-right white supremacists can be somehow shamed into receding from public life or driven from it by force of argument. But no simple denunciation is capable of producing the level of shame needed to elicit the desired effect. Nor is the political terrain conducive to the task. Nonviolent protest, aside from its moral dimensions, has been successful as a tactic because the imagery of the violence it seeks to provoke has had the ability to shame those in power on a global scale. In the United States, however, that was most effective when there was a competing global superpower that could exploit discord within the country as propaganda in an anti-U.S. crusade. With America\u2019s current hegemony, there is little that can be done to shame our leaders, and the grassroots of the alt-right are no different. When confronting people who gleefully rip children away from their families and place them in cages at the border, under the guise of criminality but actually in an effort to establish a white ethnonationalist state, shame, as strategy, fails.\n\nThe Resistance has had its greatest success in elections. There have been meaningful defeats of Republican candidates in key races. The first came against Roy Moore in the December 2017 special election in Alabama to fill then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s vacated Senate seat. Democratic nominee Doug Jones was able to beat the Trump-endorsed candidate, due in part to multiple allegations of sexual assault against Moore, including that he had improper relationships with minors. As narrow a victory as it was, it nonetheless counted and served as an important signal that Democrats could win contests outside their traditional strongholds.\n\nBut the party has had to contend with the split that showed itself during the 2016 presidential campaign. Senator Bernie Sanders mounted an impressive campaign that tapped into the concerns of many young people, and reflected a potentially far-reaching ideological shift. Yet the Democratic establishment, and cautious party members, nominated Hillary Clinton, who ultimately lost. Sanders\u2019s success, and Clinton\u2019s failure, were clear signs to those on the left that their time had come. The reluctance of party officials to concur has frustrated those who feel the Democratic Party, as currently constructed, cedes too much ground to Republicans and cannot serve as an effective opposition against Trump. When Maxine Waters, one of the president\u2019s most boisterous critics, voiced her agreement with activists disrupting Trump officials\u2019 everyday activities, such as eating dinner in a public restaurant, Senator Chuck Schumer denounced the idea from the floor of the Senate, saying, \u201cI strongly disagree with those who advocate harassing folks if they don\u2019t agree with you\u2026. If you disagree with a politician, organize your fellow citizens to action and vote them out of office. But no one should call for the harassment of political opponents. That\u2019s not right. That\u2019s not American.\u201d\n\nAny real resistance would understand that the party ostensibly on its side has done little to advance its agenda, even within the narrow scope of defeating Trump. And yet, experienced, centrist Democrats are still viewed by many within the party as best equipped to lead, at least in the near term. They haven\u2019t given anyone any reason to believe they are.\n\nThe surprise primary win in June of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over the incumbent Joe Crowley in New York\u2019s 14th Congressional District was the first sign from within the party that big changes could be afoot. Ocasio-Cortez received little press attention before her win, and ran as a member of the newly reinvigorated Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nStill, it would be easy to overreact to this single win. Ocasio-Cortez prevailed in a blue district and faced an opponent who did not take her seriously enough. She was shocked by her victory on election night. But the midterms in November delivered exactly what her win seemed to portend: a wave of Democratic victories that consisted of important demographic shifts toward electing women of color who situate themselves in the left flank of the party.\n\nFor all the celebration of this development, it is far from certain that the party establishment will adjust course. The drug of bipartisanship is difficult to kick. \u201cFinding common ground\u201d might have seemed reasonable before Trump, although the agenda of the Republican Party has been practically the same for the past 40 years. But now a new question must be raised: What about white nationalism do Democrats think is worth negotiating?\n\nThe Resistance, if it is a movement, cannot be too preoccupied with the Democratic Party as an arm of its organization. Institutions as old as the party are primarily concerned with survival. The extent to which the Democrats can be pushed in any given direction will be determined by whether or not they fear a mass exodus from their ranks. With no viable alternative party available to liberal and left-leaning voters, there is no reason to believe such an egress will happen.\n\nThe Resistance will have to ask something more of the people who have taken it up. There is a politics beyond that which created Trump. There are labor strikes, sit-ins, boycotts, and, yes, smashed windows and Nazi punching. But if it is to persuade a meaningful number of people to consent to such tactics, much less adopt them, the Resistance has to show itself as a true movement, one worthy of the name it carries and more meaningful to the people who are participating. It needs to find a definition and purpose beyond Trump.\n\nAnd when those goals have been identified, the Resistance needs to settle in for the drudgery of movement work. It has to accept that this is a fight longer and more difficult than a presidential term, even two. The Resistance can be more than what it has shown thus far. It can be the very political movement that saves America from itself. If it wants to be."

    "text": "Two years ago, two Stanford professors teamed up with a journalist to survey more than 600 \u201celite technology company leaders and founders\u201d about their political views. The average executive, they found, believes in free markets, supports gay marriage, likes environmental protection, hates unions, and distrusts regulation. He says he wants higher taxes to fund social programs, but he\u2019d prefer it if entrepreneurs ran such programs instead of the government. (This may explain his fondness for charter schools.) Countless newspaper or magazine profiles have described his lifestyle. He microdoses LSD. Each year, he travels to Burning Man. He may well have attended the Women\u2019s March or protested the Muslim ban. These, we often hear, are the politics of Silicon Valley\u2014a distinctive mix of liberalism and libertarianism.\n\n\n\nDecades ago, two British media theorists came up with a term that encapsulates this set of views: \u201cthe Californian Ideology.\u201d In an influential essay first published in 1995, Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron described the politics of Silicon Valley as a synthesis of socially liberal attitudes inherited from the Bay Area counterculture with \u201can anti-statist gospel of cybernetic libertarianism.\u201d The philosophy \u201cpromiscuously combines the free-wheeling spirit of the hippies and the entrepreneurial zeal of the yuppies,\u201d Barbrook and Cameron wrote, while mixing \u201cthe social liberalism of New Left and the economic liberalism of New Right.\u201d It\u2019s why Wired magazine could run a flattering interview with Newt Gingrich on its cover.\n\nSince the 2016 election, politicians and pundits have begun to question the longstanding assumption that the internet is always and everywhere a force for good. But the \u201ctech backlash\u201d has yet to overturn another assumption: that the Californian Ideology still governs the tech industry as a whole. The upper rungs still clearly subscribe to its tenets. Yet those tenets are nowhere near as dominant among the workers who make up the majority. And a failure to differentiate the people who own the industry from the people who work in it is causing the media to misread the rising wave of rank-and-file rebellion.\n\nEmployees at companies like Google and Amazon are challenging their employers to drop contracts with the Pentagon, ICE, and other government agencies. They are organizing for workplaces free from sexual harassment and discrimination. They are demanding better wages, benefits, and working conditions for the contractors who supply much of the labor that makes the industry run."

On January 8, Macedo\u2019s son-in-law and a leading UCKG bishop, Renato Cardoso, used the Record TV show Intelligence and Faith to denounce the \u201cfake news\u201d attacks of Globo and other broadcasters over the years.\n\n\u201cMacedo uses his cable channel as a kind of Fox News for Bolsonaro and his preferred candidates, providing all positive coverage, all the time,\u201d says Nelson Jobim, a former TV Globo news editor and correspondent for Jornal do Brasil.

Macedo argues that God has a \u201cdream\u201d to free nations from the godless left and their cultural agenda, just as the Jews were freed and brought to the Promised Land. \u201cGod has a great national project developed by Himself and it is our responsibility to put it into practice,\u201d writes Macedo. All that\u2019s required is for Evangelicals to understand their power to implement God\u2019s plan.\n\nThe establishment of the State of Israel opened the operational era of that plan. Since then, \u201cthe sleeping giant\u201d of Evangelical Christianity has awoken, and Brazil is at the heart of the unfolding Biblical drama. \u201cTo be an Evangelical in Brazil is like being a foreigner in Egypt at the time of the Pharaohs,\u201d writes Macedo. \u201cMoses\u2019 mission was to liberate the people of Israel, recover their citizenship and guide them to possession of their own kingdom,\u201d he continues. \u201cThis book is like the burning bush that revealed God and his great national project to Moses.\u201d\n\nMacedo in action does not possess the power of a Hollywood Moses, or even a cartoon hellfire and snake-handling Pentecostal. He is bald, thin, squinting into the light, a bit shy, with a birth defect resulting in slightly deformed hands. His preaching relies on quantity as much as quality. Hours and hours of it. He talks quietly: \u201cDo you love your wife? Yes or no? Of course you do. Amen.\u201d The sermon drifts, while the congregation nods along. And then you realize that, somehow, he has started talking about the \u201cwell-known\u201d danger that Satanists will kidnap your children and sacrifice them. Yes or no? That demons will take you if you don\u2019t pay your tithes. Amen. That he is a poor man and asks only that you give all your money to God. Yes or no? But all in the same soft, reasonable-seeming voice, as if what he is saying is the most obvious thing in the world. If a demon-possessed congregant collapses in front of him, he steps diffidently over him, never missing a beat.\n\nPentecostalism has always been a religion of the poor, and is especially so in Brazil, where a quarter of the population, 55 million people, live in poverty. The religion arrived in Brazil just a few years after William Joseph Seymour, a one-eyed itinerant preacher from Louisiana, began holding \u201cBaptisms of the Spirit\u201d in the living rooms of Los Angeles\u2019s black working poor. In 1910, two Swedish immigrants to America brought Seymour\u2019s fire to the rubber-boom slums of the Brazilian Amazon. Amid the dense urban squalor of Belem and Manaus, they performed faith healing\u2014cura divina\u2014for indigenous and migrant workers ravaged by the gastrointestinal and infectious diseases rampant in areas without clean water and overrunning with human and animal waste. As the services grew, so did the first Pentecostal churches. They drew so many from the cities\u2019 large leper populations, they were barred from attending.\n\nPentecostal churches promised health and wealth, in a style that borrowed from, and resonated with, the \u201cdemon-filled\u201d religious groups of Afro-Brazilians.\n\n\u201cEven if the afflicted eventually succumbed to malaria [or] yellow fever \u2026 the therapeutic value of prayer, anointment with oil, and laying on of hands proved real,\u201d writes Andrew Chesnut, the Virginia Commonwealth University professor, in his book, Born Again in Brazil: The Pentecostal Boom and the Pathogens of Poverty.\n\nPoverty has provided the impetus and backdrop for Pentecostalism\u2019s rapid 20th-century growth in Brazil and throughout the Latin world. This was especially true during the late 1970s, when Macedo founded his church in a former funeral parlor in Rio. The 1970s was a decade of rising inflation and deepening poverty in Brazil. By 1980, more than a third of rural citizens were undernourished. Pentecostal churches promised health and wealth, in a style that borrowed from, and resonated with, the \u201cdemon-filled\u201d religious groups of Afro-Brazilians, in which Edir Macedo dabbled as a teenager.\n\n\u201cPentecostalism found a fertile terrain for development in Brazil for two main reasons: society\u2019s syncretic and intensely spiritual and mystical cultural-religious basis, and its economic and social inequalities, slums and social exclusion, ripe for a message of material and spiritual salvation,\u201d says Donizete Rodrigues of the University of Beira Interior.\n\nBetween 1970 to 2010, the Evangelical (mostly Pentecostal) population grew from five to 22 percent of Brazil\u2019s population. During an early 90s growth spurt, a galaxy of Pentecostal denominations, small and large, were opening new churches at the rate of one per day. The UCKG was in the forefront, with overflowing coffers that funded expansion into Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, and Colombia, and later to Europe, Africa and, with mixed results, the United States.\n\nEvangelicals in Brasilia pray for the recovery of Jair Bolsonaro, who suffered a knife attack during his presidential campaign. EVARISTO SA/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAna Keila Mosca Pinezi, the anthropologist at Federal University of Triangulo Mineiro, says Pentecostalism feeds into the Brazilian tradition of expecting a messiah figure to rescue the nation, which has origins in myths from the days of Portuguese rule. Lula was the most recent of these figures, and his fall opened a sustained period of scandal and political crisis that allowed Bolsonaro to claim the mantle. The image of the \u201cmessiah\u201d was perhaps even stronger during Bolsonaro\u2019s campaign than Lula\u2019s. Having helped destroy the credibility of the opposition, and attained the power to mute and counter criticism from other public figures and institutions, Brazil\u2019s right-wing Pentecostal religious celebrities have emerged as highly influential voices in society.\n\nThis influence is built from the money of indigent congregants, who are systematically targeted with warnings about the \u201cgodless left.\u201d Macedo\u2019s fortune, possibly the largest of any religious leader in the world, is the fruit of a notoriously aggressive tithing culture. UCKG membership\u2014the majority female, poor, and drawn from the country\u2019s African-descended, indigenous, and mestizo communities\u2014are asked to donate a minimum of 10 percent of their income, plus any extra \u201csacrifices\u201d they can afford. Tithing can take up one-third of every service, and often resembles a shakedown. \u201cThey intimidate people who visit the church,\u201d says Nelson Jobim, a journalist. Pastors may use an open Bible as a kind of fetish, entreating the crowd to cover it with cash, checks, watches, and jewelry. In the S\u00e3o Paulo headquarters, a conveyor belt behind the pulpit carries every holy haul directly past the gilded Ark to a safe room offstage. To stoke the spirit of giving, the voice of Satan himself sometimes rumbles out of congregants\u2019 mouths during exorcisms to describe hell in low, guttural dialogue straight out of a grindhouse horror flick.\n\nMacedo\u2019s love of money is no secret. In 2009, Globo aired a video from 1995 showing Macedo laughing like a low-rent mob boss as he divides up the week\u2019s take with his lieutenants. He has been accused multiple times of corruption and links to organized crime. Carlos Magno de Miranda, who ran the church\u2019s Brazilian operation while Macedo established the UCKG\u2019s U.S. operation in the late 1980s (there are tens of thousands of church members in California), has consistently claimed that Macedo did business with the Cali cocaine cartel in Colombia. He asserts that, in December 1989, he and his wife personally helped transport hundreds of thousands of dollars plus a bag of diamonds from Medellin to Brazil by private jet. This money, he alleges, was used to finance the acquisition of Record TV.\n\nTo stoke the spirit of giving, the voice of Satan himself sometimes rumbles out of congregants\u2019 mouths during exorcisms to describe hell in low, guttural dialogue.\n\nMacedo laughed off the charges; the Colombian police took them more seriously. After arresting and extraditing a senior cartel member named Victor Pati\u00f1o to the U.S. in 2002, they discovered the Colombian representative of Macedo\u2019s church, Maria Hern\u00e1ndez Ospina, living in one of his properties. (Brazil\u2019s leading news weekly, Veja, reported in 2009 that the Brazilian Organized Crime Unit had been asked to investigate allegations of UCKG money laundering by the Colombian police, but said they had forwarded the dossier to the U.S. authorities because Macedo held a U.S. passport. No prosecution resulted in either country. When contacted by The New Republic in December of last year, an FBI spokesperson neither confirmed nor denied having a file on Macedo, saying only that the agency is obligated to investigate any credible allegation of a violation of federal law.)\n\nThen there is the case of Grigore Avram Valeriu, a Romanian lawyer who headed the church\u2019s legal department in S\u00e3o Paulo. In 1995, he sued Macedo for the return of a family collection of gold jewelry he donated to the church. Valeriu claims church employees melted down the pieces into ingots and smuggled them out of Brazil to one of Macedo\u2019s homes in the United States\u2014a claim backed up by Miranda. Valeriu has set out detailed allegations in books and articles and on TV.\n\nThe church no longer bothers to deny the allegations. And if Macedo and his entourage did once traffic illicit jewels, their days of worrying about airport bag searches are long gone. Since 2006, Macedo has traveled by private jet on a Brazilian diplomatic passport, a privilege previously granted only to senior Catholic clergy.\n\nHaving seemingly established de facto legal impunity, Macedo glories in the repetition of old charges and the launching of new press attacks, using them as further proof of Satan\u2019s desperate campaign to defeat him. Despite many attempts at prosecution, he was only jailed once, in 1992, for 11 days. A photo of him sitting in a jail cell holding his Bible is one of his most valuable advertising images. A self-produced 2018 Macedo biopic called Nothing To Lose was the most successful Brazilian film ever, beaten only in absolute ticket sales by Avengers: Infinity War. The poster is a glamorized version of the jail photo. Left-wing journalists point out that the movie played to empty theaters in which Macedo\u2019s organization bought all the tickets and didn\u2019t even bother to give them away.\n\nThe Catholic Church has made adjustments in an attempt to stop the bleeding of converts to Pentecostalism. The Church\u2019s so-called \u201ccharismatic renewal movement\u201d has borrowed some of the entertainment trappings of Pentecostal services, with the Can\u00e7\u00e3o Nova, or New Song movement, targeting youth with stadium shows and radio programs. But this has also moved the Catholic Church in the direction of a fundamentalism and conservative politics that increasingly plays into the hands of the Evangelicals.\n\n\n\nThe temple of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God in S\u00e3o Paulo. Macedo has noted that it is twice as tall as Rio\u2019s iconic Christ the Redeemer statue. Miguel Schincariol/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cPentecostalism has been so successful in Brazil, especially since the 1970s, that in order to compete, both the Catholic Church and other Protestant denominations have had to Pentecostalize, offering spirit-filled worship that is very similar to that found in Pentecostal churches,\u201d says Chesnut. A recent Pew survey found that about half of Brazilian Catholics now identify as charismatics, practicing a Catholicism that can look and sound a lot like Pentecostalism with a Pope.\n\nThe Church hierarchy, meanwhile, has taken a more conciliatory approach to its brashest challenger. In the past, Catholic bishops and archbishops denounced Macedo\u2019s operation as criminal and blasphemous, with its blessed envelopes for donations and bottles of magic oil from Israel. But in 2016, the Archbishop of Rio, Cardinal Orani Tempesta, openly supported the successful candidacy of Macedo\u2019s nephew and UCKG bishop, Marcelo Crivella, for mayor of Rio. (When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a group of Brazilian Evangelicals in Rio last December, it was Crivella who welcomed him and hosted the ceremony.)\n\nPolitically, the Bolsonaro government provides a window into what Mauro Lopes, editor of Brazil 247 and a leading liberal journalist, sees as a convergence between right-wing Catholic fundamentalists and the Evangelicals. \u201cThe Catholics of the extreme right supported Bolsonaro in the elections and now they are receiving him as one of their own,\u201d he says. \u201c[This alliance] is getting clearer every day.\u201d\n\nThis Catholic-Evangelical alliance reflects Bolsonaro\u2019s own identity. Although now officially Born Again, he has not renounced his Catholicism. The make-up of the new government is similarly divided: Bolsonaro\u2019s minister for women, family and human rights, Damares Alvez, is an Evangelical pastor; his foreign minister, Ernesto Araujo, is a right-wing Catholic intellectual who quotes Wittgenstein and gives his Biblical quotations in Greek.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s \u201cguru\u201d on the moral turpitude of the left is a Virginia-based philosopher, Olavo de Carvalho, who argues that the left in Brazil is controlled by a corrupt elite that has abandoned its Marxist roots in favor of a \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d that promotes gay marriage and feminism. Carvalho also seems to believe that TV forms the intellectual and emotional lives of Brazilians, claiming that the 30 people at the top of Globo control the entire country.\n\nHow this arrangement of forces evolves, at least in the short term, depends on the performance of Bolsonaro\u2019s government on behalf of a newly unified Evangelical vote. A nationwide poll from Datafolha from mid-January shows large majorities, up to 70 percent of respondents, disagree with his actual policies. His promise to provide security was immediately challenged by an armed insurgency from drug gangs across Cear\u00e1 state, to which his government had no new response. \u201cThey will not be able to solve the serious problem of violence,\u201d says Donizete Rodrigues, who studies Brazilian politics at the University of Beira Interior in Portugal. \u201cBolsonaro represents the military class, which has already shown itself unable to contain the violence in Rio de Janeiro.\u201d\n\nCorruption scandals, meanwhile, have already begun swirling around Bolsonaro and his family, leading to a sense of business as usual. God seems to have sent some fresh challenges, too: The collapse of the Brumadinho dam in January is an epic catastrophe. The surgery that saved Bolsonaro\u2019s life after he was stabbed during his election campaign\u2014surgery he has described as a \u201cmiracle,\u201d and a sign that he was chosen by God\u2014has led to complications that have put him back in hospital.\n\nMacedo, for his part, has been quiet since the election. Rodrigues suspects he has more pressing concerns than the vicissitudes of national politics. \u201cMy guess is he\u2019s more interested in the development of Brazil CNN, a possible competitor, whose incoming CEO, Douglas Tavolaro, is a former longtime Record executive,\u201d says Rodrigues. Whatever happens with Bolsonaro or the new cable network, Macedo is surely looking ahead. If he understands anything, it is the many forms of power and what they can accomplish, in concert, not over years but decades."

    "text": "Despite the lack of evidence against Butina, however, prosecutors\u2014abetted by an uncritical media willing to buy into the idea of a Russian agent infiltrating conservative political circles\u2014were intent on getting a win. In the context of the Mueller investigation, and in the environment that arose after Trump\u2019s election, an idealistic young Russian meeting with influential American political figures sounded enough like a spy to move forward.\n\nButina told me her story over a number of long lunches starting last March at a private club in downtown Washington, D.C. She was always early, except on April 25, when she didn\u2019t show up.\n\nShe later apologized; a dozen FBI agents had raided her apartment. \u201cThey knocked on the door, and that knock I will never forget,\u201d she told me. \u201cThey pushed me inside, told me to sit down. I was completely in shock, but what could I do?\u201d The agents searched her apartment for approximately seven hours, apparently looking for hidden transmitters or other evidence of spy-craft. \u201cIt was a horrible day in my life,\u201d Butina said. The FBI found nothing, however. There was no mention of spy gear in her indictment, and there were no charges of espionage.\n\nThis was the second time the U.S. government had sifted through Butina\u2019s personal life. Nine days earlier, in response to a request from the Senate Intelligence Committee, she voluntarily turned over more than 8,000 documents and electronic messages and testified in a closed hearing for eight hours. But they also uncovered nothing incriminating.\n\n\u201cLook, I imagined I could be in prison in Russia. I could never imagine I could go to jail in the United States. Because of politics?\u201d Butina told me over the phone a few weeks after she was taken into federal custody. It was one of a series of exclusive interviews I conducted with Butina, Erickson, and other prominent figures involved in the case, none of whom have spoken previously to the media. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it became a crime to have good relations with Russia\u2014now it\u2019s a crime,\u201d she told me earlier. \u201cThey hate me in Russia, because they think I\u2019m an American spy. And here they think I\u2019m a Russian spy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m a spy,\u201d she added, \u201cI\u2019m the worst spy you could imagine.\u201d\n\n\n\nButina was born on November 10, 1988, in the remote Siberian city of Barnaul. Part of the first post-Communism generation, she developed a passion for politics and international relations. In 2010, she graduated from Altai State University in Barnaul with master\u2019s degrees in political science and education. After running unsuccessfully for a position in the local government, she opened a small chain of furniture stores. Hoping to expand her business, she moved to Moscow in August 2011, at the age of 22, but quickly realized that the commercial competition in the capital was too great for her to succeed. Instead, she turned back to political activism and the issue of gun rights.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Maria Butina\n\nGun ownership in Russia is highly restricted. With few exceptions, handguns are illegal, and guns for hunting and sport are difficult to obtain. \u201cThe checks were incredibly hard just for a shotgun,\u201d Butina told me. \u201cFor a rifle, you have to have been an owner of a shotgun with no problems with the law.\u201d But, as in the United States, support for gun ownership in Russia has been growing in rural areas. \u201cThe strongest support is outside Moscow,\u201d she said, particularly among conservative, middle-aged Russian men who view guns as a way to protect their families. \u201cSelf defense\u2014that was the issue that they were fighting for,\u201d Butina said.\n\nAt the time, the NRA was also looking to expand internationally, and Butina was surprised at how similar their outlooks were. \u201cThey were talking about guns in exactly the same way we do,\u201d she said. \u201cThat formed my idea that if we ever want to build a truthful friendship between the U.S. and Russia \u2026 it should be people based, not leaders based.\u201d\n\nThe idea that citizens should be allowed to carry firearms had been one of the most popular issues in Butina\u2019s campaign for political office, and she had started a small gun rights group in Barnaul. Soon after arriving in Moscow, she placed a notice on the internet asking anyone in the city interested in supporting the legalization of weapons to meet at a local restaurant. \u201cA lot of people showed up,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is how the whole movement started.\u201d As the organization grew, they chose a name, the Right to Bear Arms, and began to hold regular meetings. By 2014, they had collected 100,000 signatures in support of legislation that would grant citizens the right to defend themselves and their property using deadly force.\n\nThe group itself was consciously modeled after the NRA. \u201cIt was created as the Russian version of the NRA, and we wanted to have as much NRA involvement as possible,\u201d said a former member, who asked that his name not be used because of fear of retaliation in Russia. But unlike the NRA, which has become closely aligned with the conservative movement in the United States, Butina\u2019s group sought support from across the political spectrum. \u201cI\u2019m an advocate for gun rights,\u201d Butina said. \u201cFor me it didn\u2019t matter, I talk to left or right, in government or oppositional. I had a slogan written on the door of my office that anyone who supports gun rights may come in, but you leave your flag behind.\u201d\n\nButina became well-known for her public support of gun rights in Russia, appearing frequently on television, in newspapers and magazines, and at rallies and protests. The work was, at times, dangerous; Russian President Vladimir Putin instinctively distrusts activist organizations, and surveillance was pervasive. \u201cShe was under constant FSB surveillance in Russia,\u201d said Erickson, speaking of the Russian intelligence agency. \u201cThey would go to all the public meetings of her group, and they would go to all the rallies. Sometimes just show up in her offices once a week.\u201d Putin also has a long history of opposing gun rights. Last October, he ordered the Rosgvardia, the national guard, to get tougher when it comes to guns.\n\n\u201cWe were watched,\u201d Butina told me, \u201cbut unless you crossed the line, no one\u2019s going to go to prison. The question becomes: Do you cross this line? Do you become dangerous to the regime at a certain point? I had a bag packed in my hallway at home in case I\u2019m imprisoned, somebody can bring it to me. That\u2019s my reality.\u201d\n\nOn October 30, 2013, Butina drove to Moscow\u2019s Sheremetyevo International Airport to meet two Americans who she hoped would lend support to her fledgling organization: David Keene, a former president of the NRA, whom Butina had invited to speak at the second annual meeting of the Right to Bear Arms; and Paul Erickson, who had come along as Keene\u2019s \u201cbody man.\u201d The two men had deep ties to America\u2019s conservative power centers. In addition to serving as the NRA\u2019s president, Keene, now 73, was the former chairman of the American Conservative Union. If Keene had been a general in the conservative movement, Erickson was a seasoned guerrilla fighter. Between campaign stints for Ronald Reagan, Pat Buchanan, Richard Viguerie, and Mitt Romney were far-flung missions in support of anti-Soviet rebel forces in places like Angola, Nicaragua, and Afghanistan. (On February 6, a federal grand jury indicted Erickson on 11 counts of wire fraud and money laundering in a case unrelated to Maria Butina.)\n\nButina and Keene had become acquainted through a mutual friend: Alexander Porfiryevich Torshin. A passionate pro-gun enthusiast, Torshin, 65, was a senator in the Duma and the first deputy chairman of the Federation Council, the upper chamber of Russia\u2019s Parliament. Torshin was an early supporter of Butina and the Right to Bear Arms. \u201cWe will start organizing our own Russian NRA,\u201d he tweeted in 2012, shortly after meeting Butina. A month later, he invited her and other gun rights supporters to the Duma for the first of a number of meetings to discuss possible legislative action to loosen gun regulations.\n\nTorshin traveled frequently to the United States. \u201cHis obsessions were coming to the United States twice a year for the NRA and the National Prayer Breakfast,\u201d said Erickson. Keene, who described Torshin as \u201csort of the rabbi of gun rights in Russia,\u201d had met him years earlier on one of these trips, and the two had developed a friendship.\n\n\u201cKeene is a very astute judge of character,\u201d said Erickson. \u201cHe spoke to Torshin, got to know him a little bit, and came to decide that Torshin was an honest man, which is rare in Russian politics.\u201d At one point, Keene had invited Torshin to talk to the NRA\u2019s legislative affairs committee in Washington. That, in turn, led to the invitation from Butina that brought Keene and Erickson to Moscow.\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\nKeene and Erickson were convinced that the Right to Bear Arms was a genuine organization, and that Butina was a forceful leader. \u201cWe watched over the course of nine hours that day her run this thing like the Trans-Siberian Railroad, boom, boom, boom,\u201d Erickson said. \u201cWhat Maria had built, over that year and the next\u2014she eventually peaked at almost 10,000 members nationwide\u2014it was real. It was not a false front.\u201d For Keene, it was an opportunity to renew his friendship with Torshin, and also to assess Butina, a relative newcomer in the global gun rights movement. As Erickson recalled, Keene told him, \u201cWe think that this group is probably real, but we don\u2019t know. It\u2019s worth a trip to meet this woman.\u201d Erickson and Keene were initially skeptical of Butina\u2019s ability to lead a national group. \u201cThese were rural farmers and urban industrial workers; big men, hard men, and very dedicated,\u201d Erickson said. Would they really follow Butina? Their opinion changed when they saw her address the several hundred attendees at a conference center near the banks of the Moscow River. \u201cShe strides to the podium, steps up on the stage, slams a gavel, calls the thing to order, and in machine-gun Russian, staccato Russian, starts this thing off,\u201d Erickson said. \u201cAnd all the guys in the rear stepped back.\u201d\n\nFive months later, Butina made her first visit to the United States. Keene had invited her to attend the NRA\u2019s 2014 convention in Indianapolis and tour the group\u2019s headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia. On her public blog, Butina posted a photo of herself and Keene outside the building. \u201cAn experience at the Washington office of the NRA,\u201d she wrote. Butina updated her blog frequently with details about the places she visited, events she attended, and people she met, including politicians.\n\nBack home in Moscow, the Russian government was making note of her new friendships. The previous month, the United States and Russia had clashed over the invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea, and the United States had levied sanctions against Russia. Keene adopted the prevailing attitude of the government, and wrote an editorial in The Washington Times denouncing \u201cRussia\u2019s aggression.\u201d\n\nShortly after Butina posted the photo of her and Keene at NRA headquarters, Marika Korotaeva, a Kremlin official and the former head of the Department for Internal Policy at Putin\u2019s presidential office, got in touch with her boss, Timur Prokopenko. \u201cHey. Help please,\u201d she wrote. \u201cButina ... is now posting pictures with the president of the National Rifle Association at the main office in Virginia. Against the backdrop of statements about the supply of arms to Ukraine, I ask your help.... We have to shut her down completely.\u201d (The text was part of a large batch of messages made public by a group of Russian hackers who had targeted Prokopenko.)\n\nRussian authorities continued to monitor Butina and, according to Erickson, attempted to recruit her as an informant. As U.S. prosecutors later noted, during a search of Erickson\u2019s apartment in South Dakota, FBI agents discovered a handwritten note: \u201cHow to respond to FSB offer of employment?\u201d To U.S. authorities, this was evidence that Butina had ties to the Russian intelligence service. According to Erickson, however, the opposite was true. Butina had no interest in working for the FSB, he told me, adding that he was the one who had written the note before one of Butina\u2019s trips to Moscow. He was simply helping her prepare for the inevitable questioning she would face back home. \u201cA question they always asked is, \u2018Perhaps you\u2019d like to make a more formal relationship,\u2019\u201d Erickson said. \u201cHow do you answer that to say \u2018no\u2019 in such a way that it doesn\u2019t get you in trouble?\u201d\n\nIn January 2015, Torshin was appointed deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia, the equivalent of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Over the next few years, he and Butina traveled together to the annual NRA conventions and hosted senior NRA members in Moscow. Butina translated for Torshin, who spoke no English. At one point, after a host in the United States asked if they would like one hotel room or two, Torshin made business cards that listed her as his \u201cspecial assistant.\u201d Prosecutors would later use this made-up title as evidence that she was an employee of the Russian government, although Butina said the cards were meant to keep anyone from mistaking her relationship with Torshin for a romantic one. \u201cMy relations with Torshin are like my grandfather,\u201d she told me. \u201cHe never \u2018directed\u2019 me to do anything, since I didn\u2019t work for him or the government.\u201d\n\nIn April 2015, Torshin and Butina joined more than 78,000 people in Nashville at the NRA\u2019s convention\u2014\u201cnine acres of guns,\u201d according to one of the event\u2019s ads. With the presidential election a little more than 18 months away, a dozen Republican hopefuls also crowded in for short speeches. Butina circulated among the candidates and had her picture taken with Scott Walker, the Wisconsin governor and presidential candidate, to whom she was introduced by David Keene. She was surprised that Walker was able to speak a few words in Russian. \u201cWe talked about Russia,\u201d she wrote on her blog. \u201cI did not hear any aggression towards our country, the president or my compatriots. How to know, maybe such meetings are the beginning of a new dialogue between Russia and the US and back from the Cold War to the peaceful existence of the two great powers?!\u201d\n\nThe government later characterized this encounter as evidence of Butina\u2019s tradecraft as a spy, part of Russia\u2019s larger \u201cinfluence operation.\u201d According to the FBI\u2019s affidavit against her, Butina was a \u201ccovert Russian agent\u201d working \u201cat the direction\u201d of Torshin on behalf of the Russian government to\u201cdevelop relationships with American politicians in order to establish ... \u2018back channel\u2019 lines of communication.\u201d All of Butina\u2019s travels and meetings within the United States, in this light, were evidence of a plot \u201cto penetrate the U.S. national decision-making apparatus to advance the agenda of the Russian Federation.\u201d\n\nPhoto via Facebook\n\nKeene scoffed at the idea. \u201cShe was a typical mid-twenties young woman interested in politics, and she wanted to have her picture taken,\u201d Keene told me. \u201cShe was no different from 200 similar women you\u2019d meet here or anywhere else. If this is their idea of a spy, they\u2019re really hurting.\u201d\n\nIn February 2016, Butina traveled again to the United States to give a talk at the Conference on World Affairs in St. Petersburg, Florida. Before that, however, she traveled to the Safari Club International Convention in Las Vegas with Joe Gregory, a wealthy member of the NRA whom she had met in Moscow. An annual jamboree for camo-loving trophy hunters, held at the Mandalay Bay hotel, the Safari Club convention featured \u201cpay to slay\u201d auctions\u2014where attendees bid to join big-game safaris to kill animals like lions and leopards\u2014and live music from Merle Haggard and Blood, Sweat & Tears. Torshin was there, and Butina called Erickson to see if he wanted to join them. \u201cHe says, \u2018Well, I actually have a friend who is a big hunter and who likes Russia and believes in peace with U.S.-Russia friendship,\u201d said Butina. \u201cAnd if you would like to meet him, he\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nThe friend was George D. O\u2019Neill Jr., 68, great-grandson of John D. Rockefeller Jr. and an heir to the Rockefeller fortune. He and Erickson had known each other since the early 1990s, when Erickson was running Pat Buchanan\u2019s presidential campaign. In 2010, O\u2019Neill and his father sponsored a joint U.S.-Russia conference in Moscow. \u201cI met Torshin long before I met Maria,\u201d O\u2019Neill told me. \u201cHe was a Gorbi guy\u2014a Gorbachev person\u2014and that\u2019s where this impulse to work with America came from. That\u2019s what he told me.\u201d\n\nIn Las Vegas, Butina and O\u2019Neill discussed ways to bridge the differences between their two countries. A short while later, she received an invitation from him saying he would like to host dinners for \u201cintellectuals who believe in U.S.-Russia friendship.\u201d The purpose of the dinners was \u201cto promote a Realistic and Restrained Foreign Policy and work to substantially improve the relations between Russia and The United States. I have no other agenda.\u201d\n\nAs Butina was looking into master\u2019s degree programs in the United States, O\u2019Neill offered to assist with her finances. The help was critical, since her parents in Siberia could not afford the expense. Torshin, her supposed handler, never offered to help pay her two-year tuition. Instead, it was O\u2019Neill, and her boyfriend Erickson, who gave her the money to enroll at American University\u2019s Graduate School of International Service. Unlike Scott Walker, whom Butina met in passing, and whom she would later be accused of attempting to influence, her real ties were to men like Erickson and O\u2019Neill, who had a few connections in Washington but in reality had little to no power. Still, Butina was eager to play a role in O\u2019Neill\u2019s quiet campaign to open an informal U.S.-Russia communications channel on the eve of the election, and O\u2019Neill saw in Butina someone who could help with that project.\n\nTorshin did want to help Butina and O\u2019Neill, however. He was a \u201cGorbi guy\u201d after all, and had taken part in O\u2019Neill\u2019s earlier U.S.-Russia friendship conference in Moscow. He had also been a regular visitor to the United States for a decade or more, and he regarded Butina as a friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Butina told Torshin that O\u2019Neill \u201cenjoys proximity to the formation of the future White House administration (regardless of which side wins),\u201d and that the gatherings \u201cshould help the White House experts form the correct outlook towards Russia.\u201d Torshin conveyed his strong approval. Torshin was \u201cvery much impressed by you and expresses his great appreciation for what you are doing to restore relations between the two countries,\u201d Butina wrote to O\u2019Neill, according to the FBI\u2019s affidavit. \u201cHe also wants you to know that Russians will support the efforts from our side.\u201d It was one more piece of evidence the government used against Butina.\n\nIn April 2016, as the political season was heating up in the United States, Butina and Torshin also discussed the possibility of Torshin attending the NRA convention the following month, according to private Twitter messages the FBI recovered from Butina\u2019s computer. Torshin wasn\u2019t sure he could go, because the timing of the conference conflicted with his duties at the Central Bank of Russia. \u201cI hope your female boss will understand,\u201d Butina wrote to Torshin on April 28. \u201cThis is an important moment for the future of our country.\u201d\n\nThese were the na\u00efve hopes of a grad student, not the plotting of a Kremlin operative, as the U.S. government alleged. Had Butina been a spy and Torshin her handler, she surely would have been ordered to begin cultivating a real person of influence\u2014there were hundreds out there\u2014and not an idealistic outsider like O\u2019Neill. Yet U.S. authorities cited all these messages as evidence that she was working on behalf of the Russian government. (When I contacted Torshin for an interview, he replied, \u201cI consider it advisable to do this after the publication of the results of all the investigations in the United States.\u201d)\n\nThe May dinner was held in the Washington Room at the Army Navy Club, not far from the White House. A dozen people were seated beneath a copy of George Washington\u2019s yellowed parchment commission naming him commander-in-chief of the Continental Army. Made up of a cross-section of Washington literati, the group included the publisher of a conservative magazine, the head of a Libertarian think tank, a Hollywood producer, the liberal leader of a foreign policy discussion forum, and the head of a Eurasian policy group. \u201cMaria shows up with Paul Erickson,\u201d said a lawyer who attended but asked that his name not be used, \u201cand George introduced both of them to us.\u201d He added that Butina told everyone that she was a close friend and associate of Torshin, and that they had known each other for years. \u201cIf this woman\u2019s a spy, then getting up and disclosing this information is not the way you would do it,\u201d he said.\n\nO\u2019Neill preferred to conduct his friendship dinners in private, but in the summer of 2016, with the news filled with allegations of Russian interference in the election, maintaining a low profile was difficult. This was especially troubling for Butina. \u201cRight now I\u2019m sitting here very quietly after the scandal about our FSB hacking into the [Democratic Party\u2019s] emails,\u201d she wrote to Torshin in July 2016, referring to the messages released by WikiLeaks on July 22 by suspected Russian hackers. \u201cMy all too blunt attempts to befriend politicians right now will probably be misinterpreted, as you yourself can understand.\u201d Torshin was sympathetic but unable to help. He simply told her that she was \u201cdoing the right thing.\u201d\n\nAs she began classes at American University, Butina continued to help O\u2019Neill organize his dinners. Among the people she invited, at the urging of Erickson, was J.D. Gordon, a former Navy commander and Pentagon spokesman whom she had met at a social function on September 28, 2016. He had spent the previous six months as director of national security on the Trump campaign and was anticipating a position of continued influence if Trump was elected. The next day, according to documents I was able to obtain, Butina sent Gordon an email.\n\n\u201cThese dinners were started by George O\u2019Neill, a conservative American businessman who\u2019s also a public policy genius,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe dinners are private, off-the-record, and NO ONE is ever there in their \u2018official\u2019 capacity. It\u2019s just a chance to talk about what smart future diplomacy might look like.\u201d\n\nA few hours later, Gordon emailed back saying he couldn\u2019t make the dinner. But he did include a link to a Politico article that listed him as a member of Trump\u2019s \u201cNew Brain Trust,\u201d and that referred to him as the \u201cTrump national security adviser,\u201d who \u201cis shifting to the transition to focus on veterans and national security.\u201d A couple of weeks later, Gordon invited Butina to attend a Styx concert. She accepted, and later went to Gordon\u2019s birthday party, along with half a dozen other people. That was the extent of their relationship. Gordon sent Butina a few more emails asking to get together again. In one, he boasted about a recent trip to Europe where he \u201cmet with a couple of Foreign Ministers, a Deputy Prime Minister and dozens of other government officials,\u201d and added, \u201cone of my co-hosts, a former Hungarian Ambassador to the EU, said I rcvd more press in Budapest \u2026 than Vladimir Putin.\u201d But Butina never replied.\n\nThe nature of this relationship is important to consider in the context of what came later. To a Kremlin-directed agent of influence, as Butina supposedly is, Gordon would seem to have been the perfect catch: a senior military officer with high-level Pentagon connections, a widely quoted Washington insider, and, most important, a key national security link to Trump on the eve of the election. Yet instead of recruiting him, Butina dismissed him, because her interest was helping O\u2019Neill with his dinners, not Moscow with its spying. Equally strange for a supposed secret agent, she never bothered to tell Torshin about Gordon, something that would normally get both the secret agent and the handler a nice Kremlin promotion.\n\nFollowing Trump\u2019s election, and the barrage of allegations about Russian interference, the political climate grew even more toxic. But when Torshin announced that he was planning to bring a group of prominent Russians with him to the National Prayer Breakfast in February, just after the inauguration, O\u2019Neill agreed to host another of his dinners. Butina again helped with the guest list. Since first arriving in the United States, she had spent much of her time networking with conservatives and members of the Republican Party. Now she was actually going to bring them together with fellow Russians and hopefully establish an informal back channel of communication between the two countries. \u201cPeople in the list are handpicked by [Torshin] and me and are VERY influential in Russia,\u201d Butina wrote to Erickson on November 30, 2016.\n\nMonths earlier, Butina and Torshin had even flirted with the idea of getting Putin himself to lead the Russian delegation to the prayer breakfast. Ukraine\u2019s former prime minister had attended the 2016 gathering, where President Barack Obama had given an address. Butina and Torshin believed that Putin\u2019s attendance, so soon after the presidential election, would be a large step toward improved U.S.-Russia relations. \u201cTorshin says, \u2018Let me talk to somebody in the Kremlin and maybe the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\u2019\u201d Butina told me. But the idea went nowhere. And while Torshin was able to obtain approval to attend the 2017 prayer breakfast, the Russian government declined to send official representatives. \u201cThere will be no state leaders and delegations,\u201d Torshin told Butina in an email obtained by the FBI. Still, to U.S. authorities, the fact that Butina and Torshin were even talking to the Russian government\u2014and inviting \u201cinfluential\u201d Russians to attend O\u2019Neill\u2019s dinner and the prayer breakfast\u2014was proof that they were working for the Kremlin.\n\nThe FBI has never revealed why it began investigating Butina, but it was probably as part of an inquiry into Torshin\u2019s possible ties to the Russian mafia, which the FBI was alerted about in 2012. The special agent eventually assigned to Torshin\u2019s case was named Kevin Helson. Helson worked for the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation\u2019s forensics lab in Knoxville, analyzing blood smears and latent fingerprints, before joining the FBI. He was an odd choice to lead a complex, politically charged counterintelligence investigation of the deputy chief of the Central Bank of Russia. Helson\u2019s partner was Michelle Ball, who had previously worked as a local news reporter and part-time anchor for a Biloxi, Mississippi, television station. She appears to have had no experience in anything related to the law, Russia, or counterintelligence.\n\nBy the summer of 2017, about two years after the investigation began, the U.S. government had yet to find anything with which to charge Butina. Gregg Maisel and his team of prosecutors didn\u2019t give up, however. One idea was to show that Butina was the conduit for illegal cash going from Putin to the Trump campaign, via Torshin and Butina\u2019s ties to the NRA. The NRA had reported spending $30 million to support Trump, almost triple what it donated to Republican candidate Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nThe investigation was dutifully leaked to the press. \u201cFBI Investigating Whether Russian Money Went to NRA to Help Trump,\u201d read a McClatchy headline last January, with Butina mentioned as possibly involved. But the investigation produced no evidence of illicit cash transfers.\n\nThe inquiry by the Senate Intelligence Committee and the FBI\u2019s surprise raid on Butina\u2019s apartment also failed to turn up anything incriminating. Years of physical surveillance, which, according to a knowledgeable source, included secretly following her to interviews with me, at a cost of perhaps $1 million or more, also came up empty.\n\nLacking evidence of espionage, money laundering, passing cash to the Trump campaign, violating Russian sanctions, or any other crime, prosecutors finally turned to Section 951, acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign power. Based on the Espionage Act of 1917, the law was enacted in 1948 during the \u201cRed Scare,\u201d a time when Senator Joseph McCarthy exploited the exaggerated fears of Communist infiltration of government, the film industry, and other parts of society.\n\nThe few cases that have been brought under the statute involved targeting \u201csleepers\u201d and other deep-cover spies sent to the United States without diplomatic immunity, and therefore subject to arrest. But while rarely used, it is also very broad. \u201cWe used to joke,\u201d said a former FBI counterintelligence supervisor, \u201cthat\u2019s what you use if you didn\u2019t really have any evidence, because it would have been such an easy thing to find evidence whether it was there or not.\u201d\n\nIt was a weak case. According to the FBI\u2019s affidavit, Butina\u2019s low-level networking with conservative activists and politicians, her efforts to help O\u2019Neill with his dinners, and even her idealistic thoughts about bringing the two countries closer\u2014the affidavit cites a statement Butina made to Torshin that, by inviting NRA officials to Moscow, \u201cmaybe \u2026 you have prevented a conflict between two great nations\u201d\u2014were part of a sinister, anti-American plot. This sort of insinuation and assumption is, essentially, the beginning and the end of the case against Maria Butina.\n\nAmong the FBI\u2019s key pieces of evidence is a four-year-old email exchange with Erickson in which Butina fantasizes about a possible \u201cdiplomacy\u201d project aimed at building constructive relations between Russia and the United States and suggests that such a project would require a budget of $125,000, for her to attend conferences and the Republican National Convention. What Helson didn\u2019t mention in the affidavit, however, is that because there was never any funding from Torshin, the Russian government, or anyone else, there was no influence operation. It was talk, nothing more.\n\nHelson also described a search of Butina\u2019s computer, during which he discovered another four-year-old conversation, this time with Torshin, in which they discussed an article Butina had published in The National Interest calling for improved U.S.-Russia relations. \u201cBUTINA asked the RUSSIAN OFFICIAL to look at the article,\u201d the affidavit states, \u201cand the RUSSIAN OFFICIAL said it was very good.\u201d She sent him an article to read. Torshin read it and liked it. Therefore, Butina is a spy. This is the quality of the FBI\u2019s case. When Scott Walker announced his presidential candidacy, Torshin asked Butina to \u201cwrite [him] something brief,\u201d which she did. This, too, became another piece of evidence for Helson, further proof that Butina was a covert Kremlin operative. Such mundane revelations go on for a dozen pages.\n\nYet there was no evidence that Butina was under the orders, direction, or control of either the Russian government or Torshin. Torshin exhibited no power or authority over her, and she had no obligation to fulfill any order or request. She could not be fired, demoted, or reassigned by him. \u201cI\u2019ve never been employed, I\u2019ve never been paid by the government,\u201d Butina told me, and no evidence of it has ever been presented by the FBI or prosecutors.\n\nIt could, in fact, be argued that it was O\u2019Neill and not Torshin for whom Butina was working. He was the one paying her tuition, and she was assisting him with his dinners and events.\n\nArresting Butina on such grounds set an extremely dangerous precedent. Why couldn\u2019t the Russian government simply return the favor to the United States? Putin, in fact, even seemed to suggest that Butina\u2019s arrest would lead to retribution. \u201cThe law of retaliation states, \u2018An eye for an eye or a tooth for a tooth,\u2019\u201d he said in a news conference on December 20. On December 28, Russian authorities arrested an American citizen, Paul Nicholas Whelan, a former Marine attending a wedding in Moscow, and charged him with espionage. Like Butina, he had visited the country frequently, exhibited an affinity for it, was involved with guns as a licensed dealer\u2014and is probably innocent. Now facing a possible 20-year prison term in Russia, he was likely arrested simply in retaliation for Butina\u2019s arrest and with the idea of a trade.\n\nCourtroom sketch: Dana Verkoutern/AP Images\n\nProsecutors, faced with a humdrum case involving a grad student, friendship dinners, and little evidence, landed on the idea of sex, with Butina as the Kremlin\u2019s Red Sparrow. \u201cThey were interested in sex,\u201d one of the witnesses interviewed by the FBI told me. They \u201cwanted to know if George [O\u2019Neill] had sex with Maria. They couldn\u2019t establish that, but that\u2019s what they wanted.\u201d O\u2019Neill, who\u2019s married with five children, denied the allegation that he\u2019d had an affair with Butina. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he told me. \u201cMaybe these guys have been watching too much TV.\u201d\n\nThe FBI also seemed convinced, the witness said, that Paul Erickson had been seduced as part of what they called Butina\u2019s \u201choneypot thing.\u201d At Butina\u2019s arraignment, prosecutor Erik Kenerson argued that Butina posed a flight risk, because her relationship with Erickson was \u201cduplicitous\u201d and \u201csimply a necessary aspect of her activities.\u201d His evidence for this claim was that Butina had occasionally complained about Erickson, and also that she had offered another person sex \u201cin exchange for a position within a special interest organization.\u201d\n\nThe claim, however, was a false and deliberate \u201csexist smear,\u201d Butina\u2019s lawyers argued. What the government refused to reveal was that the basis for the accusation that she exchanged sex for access was a three-year-old joke in a text to a longtime friend, a Russian public relations employee at the Right to Bear Arms. Humorously complaining about taking her car for an annual inspection, he wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you owe me for this insurance they put me through the ringer.\u201d Facetiously, Butina replied, \u201cSex. Thank you very much. I have nothing else at all. Not a nickel to my name.\u201d The friend then wrote back in the same humorous vein that sex with Butina did not interest him. Butina was also a longtime friend of the colleague\u2019s wife and child. Butina\u2019s lawyers pointed out that prosecutors had \u201cdeleted sentences, misquoting her messages; truncated conversations, taking them out of context; replaced emoticons with brackets, twisting tone; and mistranslated Russian communications, altering their meaning.\u201d\n\nYet the prosecution\u2019s suggestion that Butina traded sex for influence worked very well as a publicity tactic. \u201cWho Is Maria Butina? Accused Russian Spy Allegedly Offered Sex for Power,\u201d read the headline in USA Today. CNN carried the breaking news banner, \u201cThe Russian Accused of Using Sex, Lies, and Guns to Infiltrate U.S. Politics.\u201d Within days, a simple Google search using the phrase \u201cMaria Butina\u201d and \u201csex\u201d produced more than 300,000 hits, and she became the butt of jokes on shows like Full Frontal with Samantha Bee.\n\nFor Butina, the slander was \u201cjust a pure sexist story,\u201d she told me. \u201cI\u2019m still considered to be the source of the money, a honeypot, all this crazy stuff.\u201d The government also accused her, falsely, of using her master\u2019s degree program, where she earned a straight-A average, as a cover to stay in the United States. She was frustrated and disillusioned. \u201cI came here because kids of my generation believed in the U.S., because our laws are based on yours. This is the human rights place. They just smashed my reputation.\u201d\n\nMonths later, when Butina\u2019s defense attorneys finally forced the prosecutors to reveal the innocent, underlying messages, Kenerson claimed it was a simple misunderstanding on their part. It was a claim Judge Tanya Chutkan didn\u2019t buy. \u201cIt took approximately five minutes for me to review those emails and tell that they were jokes,\u201d she said. Kenerson then asked for and received a gag order so that neither Butina nor her attorney, Robert Driscoll, would be able to talk to the press and tell their side of the story until the end of the trial.\n\nWhen I asked Frank Figliuzzi, the former head of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division, about the prosecution\u2019s conduct, he was angry. \u201cI am troubled and hope there is a full inquiry,\u201d he told me. \u201cThis is disturbing. The question is whether this is convenient ineptitude or something far deeper.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey manipulated the evidence,\u201d was the opinion of a former assistant U.S. attorney familiar with the Washington, D.C., office. It was a place he had spent many years prosecuting cases. \u201cThe government is basically calling her a whore in a public filing.... I think it was an attempt to influence media coverage.\u201d He added, \u201cThis seems like somebody panicked, they moved too early, now they\u2019re trying to figure out what to do.\u201d\n\nIt is also another example of the media marching in formation with the government, as it did in the lead-up to the war in Iraq. \u201cI think journalism skepticism stops at whatever a prosecutor says,\u201d the former assistant U.S. attorney told me. \u201cIf you\u2019re supposed to afflict the powerful, the most powerful people to afflict are the people who have the power to put you in jail. But those are the people reporters are so often most credulous about.\u201d\n\nA senior CIA official who held one of the highest jobs in the agency\u2019s Clandestine Service, and who worked closely with the FBI on many spy cases, offered a cynical view of the bureau\u2019s counterintelligence work. \u201cThey want to generate headlines. They don\u2019t care if the information is credible or not,\u201d he said, asking to remain anonymous because of his past clandestine work. \u201cI feel sorry for Butina; she got caught up in this whole vortex. They\u2019re just interested in putting another notch in their belt, and they don\u2019t care who gets hurt in the process.\u201d\n\nDriscoll, Butina\u2019s attorney, is a former deputy assistant attorney general with the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division and has handled political and national security-related cases for decades, but never anything like this. \u201cI wake up periodically at night and think this case is taking place in some alternative reality,\u201d he told me. \u201cA \u2018spy\u2019 who uses no tradecraft and posts her every move on social media; a \u2018handler\u2019 who travels with and communicates openly with his charge; and a \u2018mission\u2019 to somehow undermine the United States by having friendship dinners with Russians and Americans seeking peace.\u201d\n\nOn November 23, 2018, Butina went to sleep on a blue mat atop the gray cement bed in her cell, her 81st day in solitary confinement. Hours later, in the middle of the night, she was awakened and marched to a new cell, 2E05, this one with a solid steel door and no food slot, preventing even the slightest communication. No reason was given, but her case had reached a critical point. Prosecutors were hoping to get her to plead guilty rather than go to trial, and had even agreed to drop the major charge against her: acting as an unregistered foreign agent of Russia. Born and raised in Siberia, she is terrified of solitary confinement. Fifteen days later, still in solitary, she signed the agreement, pleading guilty to the lesser charge, one count of conspiracy.\n\n\n\nDuring our interviews before her arrest, Butina told me that she was \u201ca huge fan\u201d of Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland. \u201cI love the story,\u201d she said. \u201cFor some reason it fascinates me. It seems to be simple, but it\u2019s so complicated a story.\u201d Stepping off the plane to begin grad school at the start of the Trump-Russia maelstrom, she, like Alice, began her tumble down the rabbit hole."

    "authors": [
      "Josephine Livingstone"
    ],
    "text": "In a tiny gallery on Henry Street last week, the young artist Chang Yuchen taught me one of her father\u2019s drawing lessons: \u201cThere is no line in the real world.\u201d A subzero wind blew outside as she held up two fingers pressed together. You see a line between them, she explained, but that\u2019s an illusion: It\u2019s really just the place where two forms meet, and that\u2019s what the artist must remember as they draw. We think of drawing as a means of merely depicting the visible world, and the \u201cline\u201d as a neutral tool in that process. But drawing is a technology that has a generative force all its own, and like all technologies it is soaked in ideology.\n\n\n\nIn Chang\u2019s case, the technology came down from her father, who had been trained in the Chistyakov system at Beijing\u2019s Central Academy of Fine Arts (CAFA). As a child, he had stumbled across a banned book of Tang poetry. \u201cHe was so drawn to the imagery of traditional Chinese literature,\u201d Chang told me, \u201cbut he couldn\u2019t practice Chinese traditional painting, because it was considered anti-Revolutionary back then.\u201d Instead, he was trained in a strict new pedagogical system, imported from Russia.\n\nBefore the Revolution of 1949, fine art in China was dominated by ink painting, particularly in the sensitive literati style (wenrenhua). But the new communist government of the People\u2019s Republic of China condemned ink painting as \u201cfeudal,\u201d and instead encouraged a new national art form in the socialist realist style, similar to the kind of painting being produced in the Soviet Union. Mao Zedong named CAFA himself. In 1955, the Russian oil painter Konstantin Maksimov arrived at the prestigious art school, sent as a kind of cultural ambassador by his government. Maksimov, a Stalin Prize winner, immediately found great popularity among the CAFA faculty. He organized a two-year postgraduate course in oil painting, which burgeoned into a wave of influence that effectively institutionalized his style there.\n\nChang\u2019s work is a radical reconsideration of the pencil drawing. Chang Yuchen / Assembly Room\n\nOne of Maksimov\u2019s most enduring legacies was his introduction of the drawing system designed by Pavel Chistyakov. A nineteenth-century educator, Chistyakov emphasized a technique that requires the student to break down what they see into planes, practicing over and over again until the artist is capable of producing a three-dimensional effect on the canvas. Chistyakov\u2019s own paintings had an expressive texture. His figures leap brightly from the canvas, and you can see in them the seeds of socialist realism: the faithfulness to life, the romanticized activity."

    "text": "\u201cI was overwhelmed,\u201d Mitchell told me. \u201cThey collected our information, created lists of our names, then made up accounts to pretend to be in a rational debate while attacking us on the back end.\u201d\n\nIn the end, South By Southwest convened a separate Online Harassment Summit, at which security was so tight due to threats of violence that, Mitchell told me, she \u201chad a security detail the whole time.\u201d\n\nThe attacks on Mitchell and other panelists were vicious, while wrapped in a thin guise of concern about \u201cethics in games journalism.\u201d This was the rationale for the entire GamerGate harassment campaign, an ugly welter of death threats, stalking, SWATting, and precision targeting of women, particularly women of color, for abuse. But that rationale was taken seriously by both media outlets, which wrote up the controversy as if it were a genuine conflict between two sides of equal legitimacy, and by advertisers, which pulled support for media organizations targeted by \u201cOperation Disrespectful Nod\u201d\u2014a GamerGate brigading campaign.\n\nGamerGate was essentially a public test of weapons online trolls would use to inflict hell on anyone who they perceived as enemies, with a central focus on journalists. Its tactics have only grown in sophistication in the intervening years. In particular, it was notable for the way it used a consistent, specious narrative\u2014ethics in games journalism\u2014to cover for its ugliest actions.\n\n\u201cThe basis was that only white male gamers are actually good at games. So everyone else needs to go through some \u2018ethics\u2019 screening,\u201d Mitchell explained. \u201cThat women sleep around and minorities are only given jobs because of their skin not because they are qualified. So that became the ruse. The narratives are used as cover.\u201d\n\nGamerGate used sympathetic journalists to add a patina of legitimacy to its cover narrative\u2014a tactic that has been repeated with the ongoing harassment campaign called \u201cLearn to Code.\u201d\n\nWhen I smelled the putrid odor of a brigade attack, I decided to do a little research into the origins of this sudden, and plainly coordinated, bombardment of \u201clearn to code\u201d tweets. (There were also death threats and a flood of anti-Semitic Instagram comments.) It was a fairly simple operation: I clicked over to 4chan\u2019s /pol/ board and searched for the phrase.\n\n\n\nIn a thread entitled \u201cHAPPENING - Huffpo / Buzzfeed / other MSM garbage (((journalists))) FIRED,\u201d which discussed the extant and impending layoffs, there were dozens of responses laying out the \u201clearn to code\u201d plan.\n\n\u201cLearn to code is what should be spammed over and over. Fuck these elitist cunts,\u201d wrote one user.\n\n\u201cReminder to tell all the fired fucks to learn to code,\u201d wrote another.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not ready to declare victory until these maggots are killing themselves with a live stream,\u201d wrote a third.\n\nAn odd little narrative sprung up around this malevolence, postulating that journalists had condescendingly told coal miners who had lost their jobs to \u201clearn to code.\u201d The scant evidence for this quickly debunked narrative was a collage of several articles covering programs to retrain jobless former coal miners in the rudiments of coding, and bipartisan job-training efforts.\n\nBut as with \u201cethics in games journalism,\u201d the narrative was just a means to deflect attention from the ultimate goal of adding distress to a terrible week for journalists.\n\nMultiple right-wing media figures consciously took the bait. After the Wrap\u2019s Jon Levine misleadingly tweeted that simply typing \u201clearn to code\u201d might get Twitter users suspended, conservative figureheads leaped in, leveraging conservative paranoia about social-media censorship. \u201cOur nation\u2019s bravest firefighters must be protected from microaggressions like \u2018learn to code\u2019 jokes on Twitter. Pathetic,\u201d wrote Daily Wire pundit Ben Shapiro. Donald Trump, Jr. weighed in: \u201cCould someone explain to me why if I tell my kids to \u2018learn to code\u2019 it\u2019s likely sound parenting, but if I told a journalist the same it\u2019s grounds for a @twitter suspension?\u201d\n\nTucker Carlson, Fox News\u2019s most openly white-supremacist host and a frequent amplifier of far-right meme warfare, ran a segment about the trolling campaign for his roughly three million viewers.\n\n\u201cSomeone on Twitter came up with a pretty brilliant piece of advice for all those laid-off journalists trying to figure out what to do with their lives: Learn to code. Perfect. Suddenly \u2018learn to code\u2019 was everywhere on Twitter,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cBut journalists didn\u2019t see the humor in this at all. A former New Yorker employee called Talia Lavin called the phrase, quote, \u2018far right hate\u2019 ... so they complained to the censorship authorities at Twitter.\u201d\n\nFor me, the open hostility of \u201clearn to code\u201d was, from the first moment, compounded by escalating misogyny and anti-Semitism. One Twitter user posing as a Jew named \u201cMoshey Goldberg\u201d sent me a photo of a pizza with a crude caricature of a Jew on it. It said \u201cOven-Ready.\u201d Others utilized a photoshopped meme of Tucker Carlson in a skull bandana of the type favored by certain fascist groups. \u201cDay of the Rope,\u201d it read, a reference to a scene in The Turner Diaries, a novel that remains the ur-text of the American far right and was an inspiration for Timothy McVeigh, where political enemies are hanged en masse.\n\nThe experience of the \u201clearn to code\u201d campaign was being bombarded with harassment that others stridently claimed wasn\u2019t harassment; being told death threats were a joke; having my name broadcast mockingly on Fox News\u2014all for the temerity of tweeting about losing a column. It was an experience of being mugged by gaslight.\n\nI\u2019ve chosen to write and speak about it not to celebrate my own victimhood, or to claim that a harassment campaign against journalists is the most significant issue being faced by any American. I write about it because it shares such overt DNA with harassment campaigns born in GamerGate and perfected since\u2014and because it is long past time that far-right trolls stopped being granted any presumption of innocence and plausible deniability. I chose to expose this campaign, knowing it would bring me nothing but grief, because I didn\u2019t want to see such a campaign succeed without opposition. And I wrote about it because campaigns against journalists aren\u2019t going to go away; the moment trolls like these see an opening, whether the provocation is real or imagined, they will harass journalists again.\n\nAfter all, the goal was clear from the start: \u201cRub it in their fucking faces. Yell at them, call them names, accuse them of being pedos. DM them pics of nooses or gay porno. Zero fucking mercy. Make them regret ever standing against us,\u201d one 4chan user wrote in the thread that launched it all. \u201cYou know what to do, lads.\u201d"

    "text": "Lawrence Rosenthal, who heads up the Berkeley Center for Right-Wing Studies, disagrees. \u201cThe likelihood is good the [Republicans] will go after Booker for this,\u201d he said in an email. There is \u201cconsiderable precedent,\u201d he argued, for Republicans using personal behavior such as diet to portray Democrats as elitist and out of touch. A 2004 attack ad against Howard Dean, for example, portrayed him as \u201clatte-drinking\u201d and \u201csushi-eating.\u201d The idea, Rosenthal said, was to \u201cplay into the \u2018us versus them\u2019 sentiment (largely resentment) that is the prime motivator of populist politics\u2014the \u2018real Americans\u2019 versus the (in this case cultural) \u2018elites.\u2019\u201d\n\nObama experienced something similar during his first presidential run, in a pseudo-scandal known as \u201cArugula-gate.\u201d At an Iowa farm in 2007, Obama railed against the high price of produce in America. \u201cAnybody gone into Whole Foods lately and see what they charge for arugula?\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, they\u2019re charging a lot of money for this stuff.\u201d This was used by the right as evidence that Obama had \u201csimply worn silk stockings and rode in limos far too long.\u201d\n\nPresidential candidates from both parties often use food as a way to relate to voters on the campaign trail. But what constitutes relatable food is almost always unhealthy and animal-based. At the Iowa State Fair, presidential candidates seek photo ops with a 600-pound cow carved out of butter, fried candy bars on sticks, and hot beef sundaes. By campaigning as a vegan, Booker \u201crisks coming across as removed from the hoi polloi,\u201d Michael Dorf, an animal rights law professor at Cornell, wrote last year. \u201cHe cannot show his love for all things Americana by eating a stick of deep fried butter at the Iowa State Fair.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that, in an era where \u201cSoy Boy\u201d has become a popular alt-right insult, Booker\u2019s conservative opponents will use his veganism to belittle him. \u201cThe idea that soy is a phytoestrogen, and thus men who consume it are less masculine than meat-eaters, is often expressed by people on the far right,\u201d said George Hawley, an assistant political science professor at the University of Alabama. Hawley doesn\u2019t believe the far-right will be as active in the 2020 election cycle, but mainstream Republicans still use food to attack liberals. Ahead of last year\u2019s midterm elections, Senator Ted Cruz attacked his opponent, Beto O\u2019Rourke, by claiming he \u201cwants Texas to become like California, right down to the tofu.\u201d\n\nBut one should not expect to find disdain for Booker\u2019s veganism exclusively on the right. Americans from all political leanings tend to find vegans, well, annoying. Meat-eaters often feel that vegans are morally judging them, or even trying to impose their diets on everyone else. Booker\u2019s opponents, especially those who disagree with his environmental positions, may appeal to those sentiments for campaign ads.\n\nPundits have already shown it\u2019s done. In a 2015 op-ed in The New York Post, Eliyahu Federman accused Booker of \u201canimal-rights extremism\u201d for co-sponsoring a bill limiting antibiotics in livestock, supporting New Jersey legislation to ban gestation crates for pigs, and pushing for a no-kill animal shelter in Newark. In a then-recent interview, he wrote, \u201cBooker talked as if it\u2019s all personal, explaining how \u2018being vegan for me is a cleaner way of not participating in practices that don\u2019t align with my values.\u2019 Problem is, he plainly wants to impose those values on the rest of us.\u201d\n\nSuch attacks seem all but inevitable as the presidential campaign season accelerates. But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll work. Strict vegetarians and vegans may not be growing as an interest group, but Americans are warming to the idea that they should be eating more plants\u2014not just for the environment, but their own health. People who identify as \u201cflexitarians\u201d\u2014eating mostly plant-based, but cheating a little\u2014now make up about a third of the population, and 52 percent of people report trying to incorporate more plant-based meals in their diet.\n\nopensecrets.org\n\nThe meat and dairy industries haven\u2019t taken this cultural shift lightly. As the popularity of plant-based products grows, the dairy industry is lobbying Congress and the FDA to demand that soy and almond milk producers stop using the word \u201cmilk\u201d on their labels, and the beef industry wants to make sure plant-based burgers can\u2019t use the word \u201cmeat.\u201d The beef industry also spent millions making sure the Department of Agriculture didn\u2019t listen to scientists, health and climate advocates who said nutritional guidelines should be changed to recommend Americans eat less meat.\n\nThe meat industry has considerable political muscle to flex. It contributes about $894 billion in total to the U.S. economy, according to the North American Meat Institute. \u201cThat size translates into political influence,\u201d The Atlantic reported in 2015. \u201cIn 2014, the industry spent approximately $10.8 million in contributions to political campaigns, and an estimated $6.9 million directly on lobbying the federal government.\u201d An OpenSecrets analysis of agribusiness lobbying shows that the meat and dairy industries\u2019 political spending spikes as demand for those products fall. How will they respond when a vegan starts making waves on the campaign trail?\n\nEven the Iowa State Fair now has vegan options. \u201cCory Booker can come to my stand,\u201d said Connie Boesen, a Des Moines City Council member who\u2019s been running her Applishus stand for 34 years. She sells multiple things on a stick: peanut butter and jelly, fruit, and even salad (essentially a skewer of cubed peppers, mushroom, carrots, cucumbers and lettuce). If Booker doesn\u2019t want to partake in the usual candidate photo-op of flipping a pork chop, Boesen said, \u201cI\u2019ll invite him to come slice an apple.\u201d\n\n\n\n* A previous version of this story stated that there were no self-identified vegans in the House of Representatives."

    "text": "Chike Ukaegbu and his brother Chibueze Ukaegbu Jr. (left), in the campaign office in Abuja in January. Photographs by Pawel Slabiak\n\nNigerian politics, with its volatile mix of money, violence, and humor, is often surreal. Out of more than 70 candidates who initially declared intent to stand in the presidential election on February 16, 2019, only two have emerged as frontrunners. One is current president Buhari, who due to months\u2019-long medical leaves in the U.K. has had to publicly deny rumors that he has died and been replaced by his double, a hypothetical Sudanese named Jubril. \u201cIt\u2019s the real me,\u201d Buhari assured an audience of Nigerian expatriates at a U.N. climate summit in Poland in December. Despite Transparency International placing Nigeria 148th out of 180 countries on a corruption index last year, with scores virtually unchanged during a four-year presidency premised on fighting corruption, Buhari has titled his reelection manifesto Next Level, unironically vowing even greater progress.\n\nBuhari\u2019s chief rival is Atiku Abubakar, a 72-year-old businessman who has been unable to travel to the U.S. since 2005, when an American investigation implicated him in a transatlantic bribery case involving an FBI sting, a telecommunications deal, and $90,000 stashed in a Louisiana congressman\u2019s freezer. Abubakar finally managed a visit to Washington, D.C. in January, reportedly helped by Brian Ballard, a lobbyist with extensive links to the Trump administration. In Nigeria, Abubakar has faced numerous corruption allegations.\n\n\u201cThe surest way to riches and power,\u201d former U.S. ambassador Joseph Campbell and Chatham House fellow Matthew Page wrote of Nigeria in 2018, \u201cis through elected office and the opportunities for kleptocratic state capture that it offers.\u201d Successful candidates today are often \u201cgodfathered\u201d by prior office holders who have amassed great wealth from public funds, bankrolling party and campaign costs in exchange for a continued cut of national treasure once the sponsored candidate assumes office. Political parties resemble businesses, low on ideology or policy objectives, funded top-down by the godfather, the top office holder, or, during campaigns, by the candidate for highest office.\n\nUkaegbu\u2019s eccentric campaign began with a chance encounter at a Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies event last April. Ogunleye, who worked on political campaigns while at a Nigerian communications firm from 2012 to 2015, was visiting with a delegation of Lagosian entrepreneurs\u2014he currently runs a T-shirt and mug customization website called Suvenia.com. The two men bonded over a passion for tech innovation: Ukaegbu had been reaching out to Nigerian officials and one presidential candidate with a technology blueprint for the country, a platform politicians could adopt and promote, with no response. \u201cYou should run,\u201d Ogunleye told him.\n\nIn June, Ukaegbu began holding daily videoconferences from New York with a core team: his older brother Chibueze, who runs a coding academy and software firm in Aba; Ogunleye in Lagos; and a banker in Abuja. The four began planning how to introduce Ukaegbu to voters, raise funds, and obtain a political party nomination, as required by law. They found inspiration, Ogunleye told me, in an Old Testament anecdote in which four lepers, rather than starve in a city besieged by the Syrian army, set out for the Syrian camp, hoping for nourishment or swift death. When they arrive, they find it full of provisions but abandoned: The Syrians heard the thunder of charging chariots and fled in haste. \u201cHow do you with four lepers create the sound of chariots?\u201d asked Ogunleye, the sleeves of his suit pinned with card cufflinks featuring the ace of diamonds and ace of spades. \u201cLead with the media.\u201d\n\nNigerian news media didn\u2019t bite, but through a contact in D.C. Ukaegbu landed interviews on CNN, BBC, and Al Jazeera. \u201cEveryone got interested,\u201d said Ogunleye. \u201cWho is this guy who is on all these global platforms? What kind of backing does he have?\u201d\n\nIn August, after 16 years in New York, Ukaegbu moved back to Nigeria to launch his campaign. Other parties showed up to offer him office nominations and cabinet positions with them\u2014a standard tactic to neutralize political opponents. During one meeting Ogunleye found particularly gratifying, a consultant from Atiku Abubakar\u2019s People\u2019s Democratic Party, eager to demonstrate that the unknown Ukaegbu stood no chance, tapped a bystander. \u201cDo you know this guy?\u201d she asked. The man squinted. \u201cDon\u2019t force yourself,\u201d said the consultant. But the man kept looking at Ukeagbu. \u201cHey, aren\u2019t you the guy on CNN?\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re good.\u201d\n\nAt this point, the scrappy #Chike4Nigeria team included Re:LIFE cofounder Isaacs, now a New York high-school teacher of graphic design and photography, producing all campaign graphics during early morning hours and school recess. Ukaegbu\u2019s older brother, Chibueze Ukaegbu Jr., CEO of a coding academy and software firm named LearnFactory Nigeria, contributed personal funds to the campaign\u2019s shoestring budget and directed efforts of his eight full-time and four part-time staffers to building websites, apps, and WhatsApp broadcasts. In New York, Ezinne Kwubiri, head of inclusion and diversity at H&M, worked her contacts to generate media coverage and organize fundraisers, in addition to helping Ukaegbu manage his increasingly chaotic calendar.\n\nBy fall, which is when I came across the campaign on social media, Ukaegbu had become the nominee of the new Advanced Allied Party (AAP). AAP chose Safiya Ibrahim Ogoh, a woman from the country\u2019s predominantly Muslim north, as his running mate\u2014balancing out Ukaegbu\u2019s roots in the mostly Christian south."

    "text": "Trump insists that the situation at the southern border constitutes a \u201cnational security crisis,\u201d but the facts don\u2019t support his justification for declaring a state of emergency. Border crossings have been in steady decline for more than a decade, undocumented immigrants commit fewer crimes than American-born citizens, most drugs are smuggled into the U.S. through or near legal ports of entry. If Trump really cared about stopping the illegal drug trade, he wouldn\u2019t reportedly be plundering $2.5 billion from the Defense Department\u2019s drug interdiction program as part of his executive gambit to secure more wall funding.\n\nTrump has now set the stage for yet another grueling slugfest in the courts. He\u2019s thrown Senate Republicans in politically treacherous waters by forcing them to choose between the public\u2019s antipathy towards the wall and the GOP base\u2019s enthusiastic support for it. And he\u2019s set a precedent that may allow Democrats to achieve key policy goals without the Senate\u2019s consent the next time they take the White House.\n\n\n\nFirst, Trump\u2019s declaration will likely have little practical impact in the short term. Legal challenges could place the wall funding in limbo for months or even years, like virtually every other major unilateral policy initiative rolled out by the administration. \u201cDid I ever say I was filing a legal challenge?\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters on Thursday. \u201cI may. That\u2019s an option. And we\u2019ll review our options.\u201d A federal appeals court allowed House Democrats to intervene in an Obamacare-related case earlier that day. Even if Democrats or other plaintiffs don\u2019t prevail in the end, delays in the lower courts could effectively run out the clock before the 2020 elections.\n\nWe\u2019ve been here before, most notably with the travel ban. His executive order to bar visa applicants from a several Muslim-majority countries went through three iterations before the Supreme Court signed off on it last June. It\u2019s impossible to know whether the justices would also approve Trump\u2019s state of emergency. Much would depend on the exact legal circumstances of the case, including who brought it and the grounds on which they challenged the declaration. No matter whether they win or lose, Democrats would likely reap some long-term benefits.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine that the Supreme Court strikes down the declaration. Perhaps the justices decide that Trump didn\u2019t act in response to a genuine national emergency, because border crossings have been declining for almost 20 years. Perhaps they decide that the National Emergencies Act of 1976 delegated too much of Congress\u2019 power to the executive branch. In either case, a ruling that constrained the executive branch\u2019s discretion would be welcome under Trump and beyond. Many of Trump\u2019s worst policies\u2014the travel ban, the family-separation policy, and more\u2014came from broadly worded legislation by Congress. Lawmakers should change that approach to lawmaking, and a nudge from the justices wouldn\u2019t hurt."

    "text": "It could be said that Audemio set his own trouble in motion, in 1993, when he paid a coyote $300 to help him cross the border outside Tijuana, as a 20-year-old seeking adventure and good pay in California\u2019s fruit and almond orchards. He crossed back and forth between Mexico and the United States a number of times that year, and he says he was caught on eight occasions, but never officially deported. Things were different then. The consequences for getting caught rarely amounted to more than a free ride back to the border. For Audemio, as for millions of Mexican laborers, skirting the official immigration system was a way of life.\n\n\n\nAfter about a year of border-hopping, Audemio returned to Michoac\u00e1n with his earnings. He fell in love with a young waitress named Amparo \u00c1ngel, who worked at a restaurant in La Huacana. They were married, and soon after, Amparo gave birth to Juan Lu\u00eds. Before Juan Lu\u00eds\u2019s first birthday, Audemio led his new family north on a two-day bus journey to Tijuana, where the couple paid a coyote $2,000 to guide them across the border. They had passed Juan Lu\u00eds off to a couple who had visas, and who claimed the infant as their own as they went through the Border Patrol checkpoint at San Ysidro, California. Audemio and Amparo collected Juan Lu\u00eds safely on the other side, joining millions of undocumented families living the shadow side of the American dream.\n\nOver the ensuing decade, Audemio found work as an electrician, a mechanic, a fruit picker, a welder, and a tractor driver. Living in and around Merced, California, where Amparo gave birth to five of the couple\u2019s children, the family blended easily with the large population of Chicanos and Spanish-speaking immigrants. But they were building a life on a fragile foundation, and in September 2011, whatever pretensions of security they had were shattered when ICE raided a field in Mariposa County where Audemio was working, sweeping him up along with several others and deporting him across the California border the same day. In the next six weeks, Audemio would be caught trying to cross the border three times, once with a counterfeit Mexican passport and B-2 tourist visa in the pedestrian lane at San Ysidro. (He had provided passport photos, signed official-looking documents, and paid almost $600 for the fake documents, which he believed to be real.) Following these four deportations in a short period, Audemio received his 20-year ban. With the removal orders on his record, he would probably never again have a case for legal immigration. For Audemio, this was a hassle, but not an insurmountable one. By early December, he\u2019d found another hole in the border and was back with Amparo and the kids.\n\nIf there\u2019s a precise date when things went irreparably wrong for Audemio, though, it was October 2, 2013. By that time, Audemio had moved his family\u2014nine people\u2014to Sidney, where he\u2019d found work maintaining rental housing for oil workers on the\n\nMontana-Dakota border. That morning, he was on his way to work, riding in the passenger seat of a coworker\u2019s truck, when a Sidney police officer stopped the driver for speeding. The officer demanded Audemio\u2019s identification, too, even though he had nothing to do with the traffic violation. Sensing the risk, Audemio protested as best he could in his halting English, but he eventually handed over an ID from Washington state, where he had been living with his family for a brief time before moving to Montana.\n\nThe officer retreated to his squad car, returning a few minutes later with a cell phone, which he handed to Audemio. A man on the other end began asking questions: Did Audemio have papers? Was he in the United States legally? The man let on that he was a Border Patrol agent, and Audemio confessed that he didn\u2019t have papers. The Sidney officer detained Audemio until an agent from the closest Border Patrol station arrived to take him into custody. (California, Illinois, and many municipalities throughout the country have implemented policies that limit collaboration between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities; other states, including Arizona, Alabama, and Georgia, have passed laws to give local law enforcement greater freedom to probe suspected immigration violations. As for the Sidney officer who questioned Audemio, he appears to have been operating outside of his authority. According to the Montana Immigrant Justice Alliance, \u201cLocal police or the Montana Highway Patrol are not immigration officers. They are not authorized by law to investigate or arrest people for their immigration status, and have no right to ask questions about your immigration status.\u201d)\n\nBorder Patrol agents transported Audemio to two different jails over the course of two days, until he arrived late in the afternoon of Friday, October 4, at the Jefferson County Criminal Justice Center in Boulder, Montana, more than seven hours from Sidney. He was issued a pair of orange pants and an orange shirt, a gray blanket, a blue bedsheet, a towel and washcloth, and orange socks. As the jailer placed Audemio into a group cell called A-Pod, he told the nine inmates already in the cell that Audemio was an immigrant who was going to be deported. Audemio made his bed on the only empty bunk and took stock of his new companions. They scared him. He could understand a lot of English, but he couldn\u2019t speak more than a few phrases. No one spoke Spanish in his cell, and neither did the two guards, who didn\u2019t seem to be wearing official uniforms. The guards\u2019 clothing confused Audemio. He couldn\u2019t tell which agency they worked for or what level of authority they possessed. Likewise, he didn\u2019t know that he was entitled under DHS regulations to be in contact with an immigration services organization, and no one told him so.\n\nA couple of the men seemed to be leering at him, making lewd gestures and laughing. Perhaps, knowing that Audemio was about to be deported, they looked at him as an easy mark. One tall and scrawny man with a long neck appeared to be the group\u2019s ringleader. Audemio sensed that the other inmates were afraid of him. Near bedtime, the skinny man asked the guards for a pot of coffee, which they brought. Audemio drank two cups, then filled a third, which he set down to drink after his shower.\n\nWhen he returned from the bathroom, he finished his coffee and immediately felt drowsy. Soon he was fast asleep.\n\nAudemio awoke in the middle of the night face down on his bunk, gasping for air, unable to move his legs or his arms. His legs were angled off the bed so that he was almost on his knees on the floor. Someone was on top of him, and he felt the painful sensation of being anally penetrated. He tried to get free, but they had his feet and hands pinned. He attempted to look over his shoulder at his assailants, catching only a brief glimpse of shadowy figures standing around the bunk before someone forced his face back into his pillow. He was asphyxiating and thought he might die. He suffocated and passed out without ever managing to scream.\n\nThe following morning, he woke fully dressed. There was an acute pain in his abdomen and he could feel moisture in the seat of his pants. He felt groggy, suddenly certain that someone drugged his coffee the night before while he was in the shower. In the bathroom, he felt what he assumed to be semen drain from his rectum. He didn\u2019t tell anyone what had happened, because, as he later told investigators, there was no one he trusted enough to tell: No one spoke Spanish, and the guards seemed as afraid of the inmates as he was.\n\nFor two more days in A-Pod, Audemio waited out the nights sitting up in his bunk with his back to the wall, clutching sharpened spoons in each of his fists.\n\nBefore his rape, Audemio was certain to be deported. He did not even have the right to see a judge because of his prior removal order. But the sexual assault made him eligible for a special category of visa for crime victims. The U Visa, created as part of the 2000 Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act, is intended to help law enforcement investigate human trafficking, sexual assaults, domestic violence, and other mostly violent crimes. The idea is simple: Protecting undocu\u00admented immigrant victims and their families from deportation makes them more likely to assist law enforcement, which makes it more likely that criminals will be caught. Audemio would have been a strong candidate to secure a U Visa in 2013\u2014or at least a spot on the waiting list, which now numbers 128,000 people\u2014if Jefferson County authorities or ICE had been willing to certify his application. They refused.\n\n\n\nThe hitch was that in order for a U Visa application to be completed, a law enforcement official must fill out a \u201ccertification\u201d form attesting that the applicant has been the victim of a qualifying crime, has information that could be useful to investigators, and is cooperating in the investigation. In the case of a person escaping a sexual trafficking ring or of a domestic violence victim, the relationship between victim and law enforcement is straightforward\u2014but what happens when a crime occurs under the protection of the would-be certifying agency, as it did in Audemio\u2019s case? If Jefferson County had certified Audemio\u2019s U Visa application, it would have admitted, indirectly, that a rape occurred in its jail. This would have been an admission of failure to follow the protocols of the 2003 Prison Rape Elimination Act, which includes a stated \u201cgoal of keeping separate those inmates at high risk of being sexually victimized from those at high risk of being sexually abusive.\u201d (Inmates \u201cdetained solely for civil immigration purposes\u201d can be considered high risk according to the PREA criteria. Notably, two of the inmates in Audemio\u2019s pod were convicted felons who had been forced to enroll in the state\u2019s violent or sexual offenders registry.) ICE would have further had to admit that it contracts with jails that cannot guarantee the safety of immigration detainees, despite implementing a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy years before to prevent such incidents and to penalize contract facilities that do not meet the agency\u2019s standards. Not only did officials from Jefferson County and ICE refuse to certify Audemio\u2019s U Visa application, they denied the rape ever happened.\n\nAudemio didn\u2019t report the rape until three days later, when he got to another ICE way station in Rigby, Idaho. A Spanish-speaking ICE agent named Blanca Chapa was sufficiently concerned that she immediately sent him to the Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center, where a nurse gave him a sexual assault interview and a physical examination. She measured Audemio\u2019s pulse at 122 beats per minute\u2014about what you\u2019d expect for a fit person like Audemio after a few minutes of jogging. Using medical shorthand, she wrote, \u201cPt is tearful, appears embarrassed, looks at his hands and floor during interview.\u201d She wrote that Audemio\u2019s symptoms\u2014tenderness and inflammation in his anus\u2014were \u201cconsistent [with] rectal penetration.\u201d\n\nFor two days in A-Pod, Audemio waited out the nights sitting up in his bunk with his back to the wall, clutching sharpened spoons in each of his fists.\n\nThe nurse handed her report, bloodwork, digital photos, and swabs from Audemio\u2019s genitals and rectum under seal to an ICE detective, who sent these by next-day UPS to the Jefferson County Jail. That same day, ICE contacted the Jefferson County authorities to inform them of the incident. The jailers were able to retrieve Audemio\u2019s still-unwashed clothing and bedding, which may have contained critical DNA evidence from Audemio\u2019s attackers. They told the Jefferson County sheriff\u2014who had officially opened an investigation\u2014that they would review the security camera footage from the entirety of Audemio\u2019s stay.\n\nOn October 10, Audemio was transferred back to Montana, where he passed through an ICE office in Helena en route to the Cascade County jail. At the ICE office, a Jefferson County investigator and an ICE agent interviewed him, with Blanca Chapa translating via speakerphone from Idaho. They kept Audemio in handcuffs, as if he were the suspect and not the victim. Describing his rape, Audemio broke down and cried. He asked for the attorney he\u2019d hired with help from the Mexican Consulate in Boise, Idaho, but the officers told him his attorney was unavailable.\n\nThis was not true. In fact, Shahid Haque, a Helena, Montana-based immigration attorney, was in the building, but was not allowed to see Audemio until after the interview ended. Amid the ensuing media coverage of Audemio\u2019s case\u2014the alleged sexual assault of a deportee while in government custody was newsworthy\u2014there was speculation that Audemio made up the rape story for the purpose of securing a U Visa. Haque told me Audemio didn\u2019t even know what a U Visa was when he reported the incident. At the time, his most urgent concern was getting the HIV prophylactics that had been prescribed for him in Idaho.\n\nA week later, Haque secured Audemio\u2019s release on the order of supervision. In the following months, Audemio repeatedly offered to assist in the investigation\u2014to look at mug shots or a lineup, to comment on testimony from his cellmates\u2014but he would not hear from the investigators again. Still more concerning, when Haque acquired the security camera footage through a court order, he found there were gaps on the night of the assault totaling nearly three and a half hours, including a two-hour block from 2:13 to 4:10 a.m. that coincided with Audemio\u2019s estimation of when the rape occurred. Jefferson County Attorney Matthew Johnson\u2014who fought Haque\u2019s efforts to obtain the evidence, on the grounds that releasing it would jeopardize the pending investigation\u2014said the gaps resulted from motion-sensitive cameras turning off when there was no activity in the cell. \u201cWhen the video skips,\u201d Johnson said in an email to Haque dated November 7, 2013, \u201cit is because there was no movement for a period of time.\u201d This was a red flag: The video from Audemio\u2019s pod cuts out for the first time at 10:30 p.m., while people are still milling around and very much awake.\n\nHaque became concerned that Jefferson County was engaged in a cover-up. Hoping that public exposure would force Jefferson County\u2019s hand, Haque turned over the footage to John S. Adams, an investigative reporter for the Great Falls Tribune, who contacted the manufacturer of the jail\u2019s security cameras. In his subsequent article, Adams wrote, \u201ca Pelco technical support specialist . . . said it doesn\u2019t make sense that the motion-activated DVR would stop recording on its own when motion is clearly visible.\u201d In other words, Johnson\u2019s explanation for the gaps made no sense, and though he would later supply Haque with more video to fill in some of the gaps, he was never forced to supply the footage from the critical 2:13 a.m. to 4:10 a.m. window.\n\nAmparo worried about her own status, given the Trump administration\u2019s clear willingness to separate undocumented parents from citizen children.\n\nFor a year and a half, Audemio and Haque waited for the results of Jefferson County\u2019s investigation, hoping, at the very least, for an acknowledgment of the crime that would compel the county or ICE to certify Audemio\u2019s U Visa application. In 2015, with the investigation seemingly shelved, Haque filed a civil suit alleging that Jefferson County had violated Audemio\u2019s constitutional rights by detaining him puni\u00adtively and in unsafe conditions, causing him to suffer \u201cserious and severe emotional distress.\u201d Two weeks later, as if on cue, Johnson finally emailed Haque with the investigation results: \u201cMy review of this case concludes that there is not sufficient evidence to support the allegations of [Audemio],\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe investigation and a second investigation by Homeland Security\u201d\u2014DHS had cooperated in Jefferson County\u2019s investigation and conducted an investigation of its own\u2014\u201cconclude that there was no cover up, videos were not deleted nor blocked out, and a crime was not committed against [Audemio]. Therefore, the case will be closed.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, in November 2016, a few weeks after Trump\u2019s election, Jefferson County agreed to pay Audemio a $125,000 settlement, although without having to admit to any liability for the assault. \u201cThat to me is an indication they knew they did something wrong,\u201d Haque told me this past May at his office in Helena. As we talked, he occasionally dragged on an e-cigarette, exhaling clouds of vapor into the room. His work on behalf of immigrants had earned him an award from the American Civil Liberties Union the year before, but it had also drawn vitriol from right-wing groups who attacked him online and, occasionally, at public rallies. He seemed wearied by the work, and by the invasion of his privacy, but also defiant. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that our system allowed all of this to happen and then deported him, and there was no one along the way who helped him at all, in the entire system,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful that they could pay $125,000 but they couldn\u2019t just sign this U Visa. They couldn\u2019t just admit that this happened to him.\u201d\n\n"

    "text": "Coffin deemed sanctuary a moral imperative, the illegality of the act being precisely what made it powerful. His activism laid the groundwork for the sanctuary movement that later took hold in the United States in the 1980s, during a time of religious revival. In that era, more than one million Central Americans, fleeing violence largely caused by civil wars in Guatemala and El Salvador, tried to seek asylum in the U.S. The Reagan administration denied many of their applications, claiming they were economic migrants and not political refugees.\n\nThe sanctuary movement began in Tuscon, Arizona, before spreading across Mexico, the U.S. and Canada. It encompassed 400 congregations (including Columbus Mennonite) and comprised 60,000-70,000 participants, according to anthropologist Hilary Cunningham. These sanctuary workers developed a centralized network to cross refugees into the United States and provide them with shelter and transport. Secular groups joined the movement, and entire cities declared themselves sanctuaries.\n\nThis new kind of sanctuary was a \u201ccultural jurisdiction based in a believing community,\u201d as Cunningham wrote. The movement drew power from the separation of church and state, the idea being that border patrol officers bursting into churches would be seen as anathema to American civil society. It also drew power from the fact that it was not formally codified in any legal system. Rather, it was a purely moral declaration that the U.S. deportation regime was unacceptable and that human lives are sacred\u2014a declaration that gained added weight because it came from a church.\n\nSanctuary was a purely moral declaration that the U.S. deportation regime was unacceptable and that human lives are sacred.\n\nOne of the movement\u2019s biggest accomplishments was that it led to amnesty for nearly three million immigrants via the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, according to Judith McDaniel, a social science professor at the University of Arizona who participated in the 1980s sanctuary efforts. The law was passed just several months after eight sanctuary workers were convicted on various felony charges for their involvement with the movement. Their trial galvanized public support for sanctuary, and none of those convicted ended up going to prison. \u201cThe government wasn\u2019t stupid,\u201d said McDaniel. \u201cThat would have been asking for martyrdom.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s sanctuary movement, often referred to as the \u201cnew sanctuary movement,\u201d is far less centralized than that of the 1980s, according to McDaniel. And while it overlaps with efforts to protect the asylum rights of new immigrants, its primary benefactors are individuals who have already been living in the United States and are being threatened with deportation.\n\nThe goal of the new sanctuary movement is twofold: to stop such deportations, and to bear witness to a system so broken and inhumane that it is driving people to live in churches. It also poses a broader question: If society is willing to leave those people alone when they\u2019re in a church, why not expand that boundary? \u201cTo me, religion at its best is saying, \u2018What we\u2019ve decided is special someplace is actually special everywhere,\u2019\u201d Miller said.\n\nSanctuary cities\u2014where local law enforcement limit their cooperation with federal immigration officials\u2014have been deemed lawless outliers by President Trump and are regular targets for attack on conservative outlets like Fox News. But on a local level, the sanctuary movement has made inroads into white communities that have otherwise been hostile or indifferent to the fate of largely Latinx immigrants. \u201cIt\u2019s putting names and faces to the bigger problem,\u201d said Reiser. \u201cWhenever an immigration article is in the newspaper, I\u2019m reading it, to find out what\u2019s going on, because it could possibly affect Edith and her family.\u201d\n\nOver the past several months, Samantha Shivener\u2019s commitment to the sanctuary movement has deepened. \u201cWhen you have a relationship with somebody, it makes it harder to ignore,\u201d said Shivener, who is the ministry coordinator at First English Lutheran Church, also in Columbus. Since July, the church has been home to Miriam Vargas and her two young daughters. Vargas, who grew up in Honduras and came to the United States in 2005, is undocumented. She was first picked up by ICE officers in 2013, but was released because she was six months pregnant with her second daughter. In 2018, she was given a final deportation order.\n\nShivener has developed a particular fondness for Vargas\u2019s older daughter, who shares her love of Harry Potter. The young girl often drops by the office, and Shivener almost always stops her work to be with her. \u201cI know she probably feels like she bugs me but it actually brightens my day,\u201d Shivener said.\n\nThis is a common transformation in the churches that host sanctuary leaders. Becoming familiar with these women\u2019s stories is part of the process. For white congregants, so is confronting the privilege that allowed them to keep their distance for so long. \u201cFor a long time, white middle class churches just kind of did their own thing,\u201d said Pastor Sally M. Padgett of First English. \u201cAnd now this issue is being put in front of them and for better or worse, they\u2019re having to say, \u2018How am I going to live out my faith?\u2019\u201d\n\nThere is evidence that the sanctuary movement is moving out into suburban and rural churches, according to Jennie Belle, an organizer with the Church World Service. She points to the fact that, for the first time, a church in South Carolina recently announced it is willing to host undocumented immigrants. \u201cBut a lot of these rural and suburban areas don\u2019t have the relationships formed,\u201d Belle said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, we\u2019re ready to go, but it\u2019s like, no you need to slow down and make these relationships. If they\u2019re going to come and stay with you they need to know they can trust you.\u201d\n\nThe process of sanctuary is slow-moving. \u201cIt\u2019s not efficient,\u201d Rub\u00e9n Castilla Herrera, an organizer with the Columbus Sanctuary Collective, told me. But for a movement based on intense relationship-building between individuals, that is the point. The question is whether those relationships can grow to the point of affecting U.S. immigration and deportation policies.\n\nJoseph Mas told me he believes sanctuary is \u201ca terrible idea in the Trump era\u201d because the administration has \u201cno moral center.\u201d\n\nAs of January 2018, there were more than 1,110 congregations in the sanctuary movement, and the number has grown since then. These include not just churches, but mosques, synagogues, and other houses of worship. Only a small portion of these congregations have physically sheltered immigrants, because ultimately, it\u2019s not up to a church to make that decision. It\u2019s up to undocumented individuals to decide whether they want to seek sanctuary.\n\nThe movement would likely benefit from a larger scale. On an individual basis, dozens of lives have already been saved, but when does sanctuary become too big to ignore? \u201cI would love to see 1,000 sanctuary congregations say, we refuse to live by these rules,\u201d Pastor Miller said. \u201cICE would have to out themselves and start coming into churches, and that would really do something.\u201d\n\nWhen Espinal moved in, Columbus Mennonite was in crisis mode, according to Miller, fearing blowback from law enforcement. Once it became clear that she was safe for the time being, the congregation\u2019s attentions turned to her legal case and advocacy efforts. \u201cFor a little bit sanctuary is the solution because it kept her in the country, and it kept her with her family, and that\u2019s a success,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBut after that it\u2019s like, oh, yeah, here she is and here we are.\u201d\n\nEspinal is pushing for legislative relief on a number of fronts: local, state, and federal. So far not much has happened. Columbus City Council members have come to visit her, but they have yet to pass a (largely symbolic) resolution supporting her. Espinal has asked her congresswoman, Representative Joyce Beatty, to introduce a private bill (legislation that only applies to a particular individual) to grant her legal status in the U.S. Organizers don\u2019t expect such a bill to pass, but they say that introducing it could be enough for ICE to grant Espinal a stay of removal. Her team has also asked Ohio Senators Sherrod Brown and Rob Portman to help Espinal get deferred action from ICE.\n\nHer advocacy efforts have created some tension, both within her team and between national organizers and church leaders. \u201cShe has nothing to lose by publicly challenging Democratic public officials, for example,\u201d said Miller. Columbus Mennonite, on the other hand, needs to maintain relationships with local leaders who help the church with other initiatives. \u201cI\u2019ve felt uncomfortable at some points by how much she wants to push, and there have been some times where I\u2019ve said, \u2018We need to hold back on that,\u2019 and I was probably wrong.\u201d\n\nBut the broader challenge stems from forces beyond the control of Espinal or the sanctuary movement. Joseph Mas told me he believes sanctuary is \u201ca terrible idea in the Trump era\u201d because the administration has \u201cno moral center\u201d and the moral appeal of the sanctuary movement has nowhere to resonate. It seems doubtful that the religious and moral calls of the sanctuary movement will hold purchase with Trump\u2019s base of white conservative Evangelicals, whose views on immigration are shaped far more by militant conservatism than by scripture.\n\nIf ICE officers begin bursting into churches, however, the contemporary sanctuary movement could start to resemble the Civil Rights Movement, where it took violent state response to nonviolent resistance for white American lawmakers to begin changing policy.\n\nSome organizers worry that such images may not be enough. The cruelty of the Trump administration has already been laid bare on countless occasions, but nevertheless it continues. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t the death of a little Guatemalan girl at the hands of border patrol, why wouldn\u2019t that be the optic that would turn it around?\u201d asked Judith McDaniel, referring to Jakelin Caal, a seven-year-old who died in December while in Customs and Border Protection custody, shortly after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border with her father. Still, she recognized that there are differences: \u201cI guess because she\u2019s a brown girl and if ICE went into churches there would probably be white parishioners who would be pushed aside.\u201d\n\nMas told me he believes violent confrontation may be necessary for real change to take place, for the moral argument to resonate with the majority of white Americans. \u201cIt\u2019s a great irony that the history of the United States has shown that until bullets start flying, until people die, until people are gassed, that the nation doesn\u2019t pay attention,\u201d Mas said. \u201cAnd that is where we find ourselves at this moment. We\u2019re at that intersection now.\u201d\n\nThis story has been supported by the Solutions Journalism Network, a nonprofit organization dedicated to rigorous and compelling reporting about responses to social problems."

    "text": "Romantic love introduced the idea of a narrative into an individual\u2019s life\u2026. The telling of a story is one of the meanings of \u2018romance\u2019, but this story now became individualised, inserting self and other into a personal narrative which had no particular reference to wider social processes. The rise of the romantic novel more or less coincided with the emergence of the novel: the connection was one of newly discovered narrative form.\n\nA search for \u201clove\u201d in Google Books\u2019 Ngram Viewer adds weight to his theory: Use of the word peaked in the mid-1800s, coinciding neatly with the height of the romance-obsessed Victorian novel.\n\nBut on this side of the pond, contrary to that graph, the conventional wisdom is that love peaked in the 1960s\u2014specifically the \u201cSummer of Love,\u201d in 1967. I\u2019ll even go so far as to pinpoint an exact day: July 7, 1967. That\u2019s when Time magazine came out with a trippy cover featuring \u201cThe Hippies,\u201d a subculture famous for practicing \u201cfree love,\u201d and also when The Beatles released the single \u201cAll You Need Is Love.\u201d Written to be a simplistic anti-war slogan that anyone in the world could understand, the song is nonetheless a perfect example of how love can render delusional an otherwise reasonable, intelligent human being like John Lennon. Its chorus is demonstrably untrue. Love is quite far down on the list of things that humans \u201cneed\u201d\u2014in fact, it\u2019s not on the list at all. Humans need oxygen, water, and food, in that order. Everything else is optional (though clothes and shelter are nearly essential, depending on the climate). Humans are perfectly capable of living an entire life without love. Squirrels don\u2019t love and they seem to be doing just fine.\n\nAnyone who claims that \u201clove is all you need,\u201d like it\u2019s some kind of panacea, is no better than a snake-oil salesman slinging a bogus elixir. Love is at least as harmful as it is beneficial. What\u2019s odd is that our culture recognizes as much, and yet it venerates love while romanticizing the pain it can cause. Yes, we say, \u201dlove hurts, love scars, love wounds,\u201d but such are the risks. The thing is, falling in love is kind of awful, too! The symptoms are much the same as heartbreak: You can\u2019t eat because you\u2019re permanently queasy, can\u2019t sleep when she\u2019s not beside you, can\u2019t pay attention at work or think straight at all (I write and read books far less when I\u2019m infatuated with someone), and you spend most of your time crafting overwrought emails, looking at photos of her, and stalking her social media accounts. We wax lyrical about how love makes fools of us, but there is nothing admirable about being a fool.\n\nLove has certainly made a fool of me before\u2014I have the passport stamps to prove it\u2014but I can\u2019t say with certainty how many times I\u2019ve fallen in love. Maybe five times, maybe twice, maybe never. This is exactly the problem with being \u201cin love\u201d: It is the most subjective feeling in the human experience. \u201cYou\u2019ll know it when you feel it,\u201d people say. This is horseshit. I have been convinced several times of it, only for the feeling to fade (or be stomped out). Furthermore, several people who have told me \u201cyou\u2019ll know\u201d are no longer with the person who made them \u201cfeel it.\u201d The notion of \u201cone true love,\u201d that there is a single person in this world who you were meant to fall in love with, has mercifully fallen out of fashion\u2014although less because it\u2019s clearly an illogical fantasy and more because that would spell doom for many of us (what if your one true love happened to live in Papua New Guinea?). But \u201ctrue love,\u201d minus the \u201cone,\u201d somehow persists. It exists in opposition, apparently, to fleeting love\u2014to flings, crushes, and affairs. But really it\u2019s just another form of social elitism: If we believe we have found true love, we are better at life than those who have not."

    "text": "The bill\u2019s final text had not been released by noon on Wednesday, but it appears more performative than legislative for Democrats, too. Negotiators had privately pushed for a hard cap on the number of people who can be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Trump and his congressional allies responded by framing the request as an attempt to release hardened criminals onto America\u2019s streets. As Mother Jones\u2019 Noah Lanard noted, most of the people detained by ICE were originally arrested for minor offenses like traffic stops. But the pushback appears to have worked, as no such hard cap appears to be in the final package. (Instead, it reportedly sets funding for detention beds at 17 percent below current levels, but allows ICE to draw additional detention funds from other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security.)\n\nWhile a wall would undoubtedly stop some people from crossing the southern border, it also misunderstands how undocumented immigration works. Most of the nation\u2019s undocumented immigrants came to the U.S. legally and then overstayed their visas; most evidence suggests that unauthorized border crossings have steadily plummeted since the Great Recession. Nor would a wall stem the flow of illegal drugs into the country, as Trump has repeatedly insisted it. Almost all of those drugs enter through the nation\u2019s ports of entry, not the hinterlands that separate them.\n\n\n\nThe wall may thus sound like a solution in search of a problem, but that would be misunderstanding its purpose. The real problem is Trump\u2019s political self-image. The wall\u2019s main goal is to serve as a physical manifestation of the president\u2019s reactionary white nationalism. He pushed the idea so aggressively on the campaign trail because it symbolizes his xenophobic worldview, functioning more as rallying cry for his like-minded supporters than as a practical redoubt for the nation.\n\nThis explains why Trump has switched to lying about the border wall\u2019s status. News that a compromise had been struck first broke during Trump\u2019s rally in El Paso, Texas, on Monday, and he passed this along to his assembled supporters. \u201cJust so you know, we\u2019re building the wall anyway,\u201d he said to cheers. The White House has been floating the idea of declaring a national state of emergency to divert other government funds to make this a reality. Such a move would almost certainly end up in the courts, where the administration has a grim track record. What matters to Trump is not necessarily that he wins, just that he\u2019s not seen as losing.\n\nAll of this kabuki theater would be more bearable if it had no real-world impact. For the federal workers who endured lost paychecks because of the president\u2019s posturing, that\u2019s not the case. The rest of the nation lost something, too. Time is a finite resource that the Trump administration is nonetheless eager to squander. Members of Congress have spent months trying to fashion something that would satisfy Trump\u2019s voluble whims. All the energy and effort could have been spent on literally any other plausible legislative effort\u2014infrastructure funding, further criminal-justice reform, the opioid crisis, or drug-price reform. Instead it went toward soothing the president\u2019s bruised ego and burnishing his tattered self-image."

    "text": "Despite shortcomings, Madrid did succeed in bringing all the parties in the Arab-Israeli conflict to the negotiating table for the first time. The conference launched unprecedented multilateral cooperation between Israel and the Arab world on arms control and regional security, economic development, the environment, water, and refugees. It broke a taboo of Arab officials refusing to sit with Israeli officials. Gulf states like Oman and Qatar hosted Israeli delegations in subsequent years, with a surprising amount of engagement continuing even after the demise of the Clinton-era Oslo peace process by the late 1990s.\n\n\n\nTo develop the conference, Baker spent eight months in what is known as \u201cshuttle diplomacy,\u201d consulting regional and international partners on the meeting, even co-chairing the summit with the Soviet Union. The vision of the conference was clear: to capitalize on the war\u2019s conclusion to build a foundation for regional peace, with the resolution of the Israel-Palestinian conflict as the cornerstone of the effort.\n\n\n\nCompare that kind of preparation and vision with that of the current administration. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the summit in an interview scarcely a month ahead of the actual meeting, evidently without consulting key allies, even reportedly surprising its Polish hosts: In the midst of a Middle East trip to shore up regional pressure against Iran, Pompeo suggested an important element of the conference would be \u201cmaking sure Iran is not a destabilizing influence.\u201d\n\n\n\nJust a few weeks later, after pushback from Poland as well as European allies uncomfortable using an international summit to target one country, the administration broadened the aims of the meeting to focus on a range of issues, from extremism, to missiles, to terrorism (all topics of high relevance in the Iran file). With the administration\u2019s special envoy on Iran playing an instrumental role in organizing the forum, skepticism remains about the meeting being anything other than a vehicle to pressure and isolate Iran. \u201cThe first issue on the agenda is Iran,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu said Sunday, despite the word \u201cIran,\u201d according to the BBC, appearing nowhere on the official agenda. Needless to say, Iran has not been invited, and key global and regional players like Russia, Turkey, and the Palestinians declined to attend.\n\n\n\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict is also not on the agenda, though President Trump\u2019s \u201cpeace team\u201d is reportedly attending. This decision marks another key difference with the Madrid conference. While the Bush administration\u2019s team did not believe that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was the sole or even primary source of the region\u2019s instability\u2014after all, the United States just fought Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq in a war that had nothing to do with Israel\u2014they also correctly recognized that without a resolution to the conflict, Israel would never be at peace and the region would never be stable."

    "text": "\u201cBy any objective measure, the law has failed,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThirty states of emergency are in effect today\u2014several times more than when the act was passed. Most have been renewed for years on end. And during the 40 years the law has been in place, Congress has not met even once, let alone every six months, to vote on whether to end them.\u201d The Brennan Center tabulated 123 duly-passed laws that grant the executive branch sweeping new powers at the president\u2019s discretion, including the ability to lawfully commandeer telecommunications systems and declare martial law.\n\nThe lawmakers of an earlier age thus made an egregious oversight: They assumed that future presidents would use these extraordinary powers in good faith, to address genuine national emergencies. The Trump administration is a monument to their lack of foresight. In an unhappy syzygy, the areas where Congress has ceded the most power and the broadest discretion\u2014immigration and national security\u2014also happen to be Trump\u2019s favorite playgrounds for both policy and politics.\n\nTake the current state of the Temporary Protected Status system. Congress set it up in 1990 to give temporary legal status to foreign nonimmigrants in the United States if they are fleeing extraordinary hardship in their home country, such as civil war or a major natural disaster. Trump\u2019s predecessors used it to shield migrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and seven other countries from deportation. Trump used that discretion to decline to renew legal status for most of those groups. More than 200,000 people, some of whom who had spent more than two decades building lives in the U.S., are now at risk for deportation when their status expires over the next few years.\n\nThe administration has an uncanny knack for exploiting oft-overlooked provisions in American immigration law. Trump ad-libbed his first proposal for the Muslim travel ban on the campaign trail in December 2015, originally describing it as a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d No law authorizing such a ban would ever make it through Congress today. Nonetheless, he was able to implement a ban on several Muslim-majority countries by citing a provision in a 1952 federal immigration law that allows the president to \u201csuspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens\u201d for an indefinite period if he deems their entry to be \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nWhy did Congress give the president such sweeping powers? The State Department\u2019s Office of the Historian noted that two of the law\u2019s authors, Nevada Senator Pat McCarran and Pennsylvania Representative Francis Walter, had previously \u201cexpressed concerns that the United States could face communist infiltration through immigration and that unassimilated aliens could threaten the foundations of American life.\u201d The Supreme Court also typically gives its broadest level of deference to presidential power when it is invoked in the name of national security. Those precedents led the justices to narrowly uphold Trump\u2019s travel ban last June, effectively sanctifying the most bigoted presidential act in modern American history.\n\nCongress\u2019 past foolishness does not excuse Trump\u2019s current actions, but a declaration of emergency for political gain would not mark a terminal slide into authoritarian rule. It might even do some good by shining a spotlight on the mistakes and misjudgments of past Congresses\u2014and providing powerful evidence of the need for lawmakers to claw back the legal authority that was too freely granted to presidents over the past century."

    "text": "He is so unpresidential that when he meets the minimum requirements of decency, he is praised as if he has done something consequential. When he addressed a joint session of Congress early in his presidency, he managed to read his prepared speech from a teleprompter without the bluster that characterized his campaign rallies or press conferences, and at one point honored the wife of a slain Navy seal. \u201cHe became president of the United States in that moment, period,\u201d CNN\u2019s Van Jones declared. No matter that the speech contained outright falsehoods about immigration, crime, welfare, the federal budget, and that it overstated the impact the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines would have on job creation (not to mention the disastrous environmental impact and displacement of indigenous people). What mattered was his presentation. Trump briefly sounded like a president. That should not have been enough. But for a moment it was.\n\nThe Resistance is not about whether one agrees or disagrees with Trump on the issues, whatever those may be. It is not about policy. It is about the threat that Trump poses to the idea of progress, the comforting notion, entrenched by the election of Barack Obama, that things in this country could get better without anyone having to give anything up to make that so. When Trump refuses to denounce white supremacist groups that have endorsed him, the issue becomes less that his beliefs line up with theirs, and more that he has not rhetorically separated himself from avowed white supremacists. It becomes embarrassing to witness him on a global stage push past other world leaders so that he can be in front of a photo-op. His sophomoric speaking style is far below the level of what presidents are supposed to be able to employ. He watches television compulsively and live tweets his favorite Fox News shows. He refuses to release his tax returns to be reviewed by the American people. He is deeply incurious and proudly so, refusing to sit for traditional presidential briefs or to read anything that doesn\u2019t mention him by name. During a ceremony to reintroduce the National Space Council, he responded to Buzz Aldrin\u2019s sarcastic exclamation of \u201cInfinity and beyond!\u201d by saying, \u201cIt could be infinity. We don\u2019t really don\u2019t know. But it could be. It has to be something\u2014but it could be infinity, right?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not good to have someone with so little interest in knowledge as president, someone who flaunts his ignorance as a badge of populist pride. And that is the dilemma the Resistance faces in exercising any meaningful political power. Trump has defied the norms and expectations of the presidency, and American politics more generally, and succeeded. The Resistance has made heroes of those who have pointed this out. But it has not questioned the basic nature of the presidency, or the country. It is dangerous to believe there is some victory in removing one person from an oppressive system while leaving the system intact. This is a dynamic the Resistance has shown no interest in addressing. Until it does, it can never be a movement.\n\nThere is a gross underestimation of how norms produced the Trump presidency. The Electoral College is an American norm. Placating racist voters is the norm, and cuts across both parties. Distrust and disdain for women in positions of power is the norm. Executive orders that overstep the constitutional powers granted to the presidency are now the norm. Some norms need to be challenged. America\u2019s liberals have only been willing to challenge them to the extent that they do not uncomfortably burden its ruling classes with drastic calls for change. The Resistance has reflected that stance. It is the major impediment to consolidating this would-be movement around an agenda worth fighting for. Even if the principal objective is the removal of Trump from office, what drives that cannot be a desire for a return to what was once defined as normal. That would only set the stage for another Trump to rise. The goal has to be a complete reconsideration of the American system of governance.\n\nResistance is a reactive state of mind,\u201d Michelle Alexander wrote in The New York Times. \u201cWhile it can be necessary for survival and to prevent catastrophic harm, it can also tempt us to set our sights too low and to restrict our field of vision to the next election cycle, leading us to forget our ultimate purpose and place in history.\u201d Viewed this way, the word resistance itself provides the wrong framework for understanding what must be done. James Baldwin refused to say the \u201cCivil Rights Movement\u201d because it was a term applied by white media onlookers. He instead referred to the period of heightened activism in the 1950s and \u201960s as the \u201clatest slave rebellion.\u201d The contrast in meaning is stark. The enslaved possess no rights to be protected, only a system of dehumanization and exploitation to rebel against. Phrasing it this way captures a very different, very dire political terrain, one that requires a higher level of militancy to effectively counter.\n\nThe Resistance is something else entirely. Its active distancing from militancy reveals as much. On January 20, 2017, the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration, thousands of protesters in Washington, D.C., took part in a different kind of demonstration than the one that would follow the next day during the Women\u2019s March. Two hundred and thirty-four people would be arrested and face charges including felony inciting to riot, conspiracy to riot, rioting, and destruction of property. The J20 march, as it came to be known, was not just anti-Trump but anti-capitalist and anti-fascist. Its participants left a trail of thrown objects and smashed windows. Police teargassed and arrested them.\n\nThese protesters were roundly denounced by those who supported the next day\u2019s events. Indeed, the virtual absence of arrests among the estimated 500,000 to one million people at the Women\u2019s March in D.C. (or among demonstrators at any of the other sites across the country) the next day was heralded as a sign of its success. These were peaceful participants in democratic action, unlike the rabble-rousers of J20.\n\nThere is something immensely powerful about orchestrating the largest single-day march in the history of this country, as the Women\u2019s March is believed to be. Many of its participants had previously never attended a march or thought of themselves as actively political. But there is also something shortsighted about not simultaneously embracing the J20 protesters. Those repelled by their tactics see only destruction and chaos, rather than the inevitable direct confrontation of state power\u2014inevitable if there is a goal past the removal of Trump. The two years of his presidency have shown that he is a uniquely dangerous president, but his ascent was made possible by entrenched interests that predate him. He is only the latest representative.\n\nConfrontational resistance is justified because conventional processes can only do so much to mitigate harm. Voting, in particular, is effective only to the point that it is understood that the citizenry will forcefully dissent from governance if its will is not honored. But it must also be understood that the problems Trump represents do not only exist at the state level. What is now called the \u201calt-right\u201d has been organizing itself, in the shadows, for decades. Its adherents have developed alternative information channels, formed online communities, adopted a common language, and mobilized in ways that have found a home in the Republican Party.\n\nTheir agenda is best understood in the simplest terms: white supremacy. And yet they have been treated with an inordinate amount of benign curiosity, as if they present some fresh ideological viewpoint worthy of consideration in what is, in name, a multiracial democracy. Profiles of their supposedly dapper media leaders have portrayed them as fairly innocuous.\n\nBut as the killing of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville in August 2017 showed, the violence of white supremacy is both broader and deeper than the apparatus of the state under Trump. The young men photographed clad in polos and khakis, carrying torches and yelling \u201cJews will not replace us!\u201d are not minor actors in a political game. They are a vicious threat.\n\nThe Resistance has not settled on an adequate response to this threat. Months before Heyer was killed, the alt-right provocateur Richard Spencer made headlines, not for his inflammatory rhetoric, but for being the subject of a viral video in which an antifa activist punched him in the face. The violence was decried, in some circles, as the wrong approach to his growing influence. It was also suggested by some liberal voices that other tactics, like protesting paid speaking engagements for the likes of Milo Yiannopoulos and Steve Bannon, were also outside the bounds of civility and proper discourse. Better to expose their ideas and debate them with a superior vision of an American future.\n\nThis misjudges the extent of their appeal, the composition of their threat, and naively places faith in the American populace that it will reject nativist, xenophobic, racist ideologies for their core maliciousness. There is less progress on that front than many would like to believe.\n\nIt also presumes that alt-right white supremacists can be somehow shamed into receding from public life or driven from it by force of argument. But no simple denunciation is capable of producing the level of shame needed to elicit the desired effect. Nor is the political terrain conducive to the task. Nonviolent protest, aside from its moral dimensions, has been successful as a tactic because the imagery of the violence it seeks to provoke has had the ability to shame those in power on a global scale. In the United States, however, that was most effective when there was a competing global superpower that could exploit discord within the country as propaganda in an anti-U.S. crusade. With America\u2019s current hegemony, there is little that can be done to shame our leaders, and the grassroots of the alt-right are no different. When confronting people who gleefully rip children away from their families and place them in cages at the border, under the guise of criminality but actually in an effort to establish a white ethnonationalist state, shame, as strategy, fails.\n\nThe Resistance has had its greatest success in elections. There have been meaningful defeats of Republican candidates in key races. The first came against Roy Moore in the December 2017 special election in Alabama to fill then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s vacated Senate seat. Democratic nominee Doug Jones was able to beat the Trump-endorsed candidate, due in part to multiple allegations of sexual assault against Moore, including that he had improper relationships with minors. As narrow a victory as it was, it nonetheless counted and served as an important signal that Democrats could win contests outside their traditional strongholds.\n\nBut the party has had to contend with the split that showed itself during the 2016 presidential campaign. Senator Bernie Sanders mounted an impressive campaign that tapped into the concerns of many young people, and reflected a potentially far-reaching ideological shift. Yet the Democratic establishment, and cautious party members, nominated Hillary Clinton, who ultimately lost. Sanders\u2019s success, and Clinton\u2019s failure, were clear signs to those on the left that their time had come. The reluctance of party officials to concur has frustrated those who feel the Democratic Party, as currently constructed, cedes too much ground to Republicans and cannot serve as an effective opposition against Trump. When Maxine Waters, one of the president\u2019s most boisterous critics, voiced her agreement with activists disrupting Trump officials\u2019 everyday activities, such as eating dinner in a public restaurant, Senator Chuck Schumer denounced the idea from the floor of the Senate, saying, \u201cI strongly disagree with those who advocate harassing folks if they don\u2019t agree with you\u2026. If you disagree with a politician, organize your fellow citizens to action and vote them out of office. But no one should call for the harassment of political opponents. That\u2019s not right. That\u2019s not American.\u201d\n\nAny real resistance would understand that the party ostensibly on its side has done little to advance its agenda, even within the narrow scope of defeating Trump. And yet, experienced, centrist Democrats are still viewed by many within the party as best equipped to lead, at least in the near term. They haven\u2019t given anyone any reason to believe they are.\n\nThe surprise primary win in June of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over the incumbent Joe Crowley in New York\u2019s 14th Congressional District was the first sign from within the party that big changes could be afoot. Ocasio-Cortez received little press attention before her win, and ran as a member of the newly reinvigorated Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nStill, it would be easy to overreact to this single win. Ocasio-Cortez prevailed in a blue district and faced an opponent who did not take her seriously enough. She was shocked by her victory on election night. But the midterms in November delivered exactly what her win seemed to portend: a wave of Democratic victories that consisted of important demographic shifts toward electing women of color who situate themselves in the left flank of the party.\n\nFor all the celebration of this development, it is far from certain that the party establishment will adjust course. The drug of bipartisanship is difficult to kick. \u201cFinding common ground\u201d might have seemed reasonable before Trump, although the agenda of the Republican Party has been practically the same for the past 40 years. But now a new question must be raised: What about white nationalism do Democrats think is worth negotiating?\n\nThe Resistance, if it is a movement, cannot be too preoccupied with the Democratic Party as an arm of its organization. Institutions as old as the party are primarily concerned with survival. The extent to which the Democrats can be pushed in any given direction will be determined by whether or not they fear a mass exodus from their ranks. With no viable alternative party available to liberal and left-leaning voters, there is no reason to believe such an egress will happen.\n\nThe Resistance will have to ask something more of the people who have taken it up. There is a politics beyond that which created Trump. There are labor strikes, sit-ins, boycotts, and, yes, smashed windows and Nazi punching. But if it is to persuade a meaningful number of people to consent to such tactics, much less adopt them, the Resistance has to show itself as a true movement, one worthy of the name it carries and more meaningful to the people who are participating. It needs to find a definition and purpose beyond Trump.\n\nAnd when those goals have been identified, the Resistance needs to settle in for the drudgery of movement work. It has to accept that this is a fight longer and more difficult than a presidential term, even two. The Resistance can be more than what it has shown thus far. It can be the very political movement that saves America from itself. If it wants to be."

    "text": "Friday is Valentine\u2019s Day, the most saccharine holiday of the year. Ignoring it is noble social protest but, I can report from experience, risky domestic policy. Which is why, over the next two days, millions of consumers will be buying their significant others ridiculous red cards.\n\nAccording to the industry\u2019s trade group, some 145 million Valentine\u2019s cards are sold in the U.S. every year. Those cards are ridiculous not just because of the sappy sayings on their covers. They\u2019re ridiculous because, on a planet of seven billion people, it\u2019s nuts to buy a piece of card stock, place it into a paper envelope, and give it to someone who (I love you, honey) will smile at it, stuff it in a sock drawer, and, almost certainly, never glance at it again. It\u2019s even crazier to buy said piece of card stock, drive it to the post office, and have the U.S. mail truck it to an airport and then fly it to its destination.\n\nSure, you could criticize on environmental grounds all manner of small pleasures, such as eating burgers, or driving gasoline-powered cars, or drinking frostily refrigerated beer (all habits in which I happily engage). Yet sending a greeting card is worse as an example of personal carelessness, because its greener alternative is so painless and, indeed, so much more convenient. I don\u2019t like veggie burgers, I can\u2019t afford a Tesla, and I hate warm beer. But forsaking a paper greeting card for an emailed Valentine? I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2014as well as my family and you\u2014could live with that.\n\nReason is no match for emotion, of course, so it\u2019s no surprise that the dead-tree greeting-card industry continues to thrive. Sentimental pastimes die hard, and greeting cards aren\u2019t Superfund sites. Still, the continued survival of the greeting-card tradition neatly underscores why it\u2019s so difficult to affect far bigger environmental change. At the very least, it suggests people are being less than honest when they tell pollsters they\u2019re interested in making environmental tweaks in their lives, even tweaks that are easy and cheap. It\u2019s hard to believe large percentages of Americans will abide a stiff carbon tax when they\u2019re not willing to stop using throw-away pieces of shiny cardboard to send their love notes."

    "text": "The murderous spirit of Ventril Dease, unfortunately, appears to inhabit his works. One by one, the movie\u2019s key players are picked off by violent \u201caccidents\u201d that take place when they\u2019re near art. A rude handler reaches a sticky end while next to a tacky gas station print of some dogs. Somebody else gets their arm eaten by an expensive sculpture. It\u2019s all very schlocky, a little \u201880s, and extremely fun.\n\nThe criteria for suffering supernatural death seems to be simple: If you have profited off the artwork of Ventril Dease, which was never supposed to be exhibited, then you\u2019re in for it. That seems a straightforward critique, on first glance: Commerce destroys the spirit of art, and in this case the art is out for revenge. But the form that the violence takes suggests a more interesting and complex theme. You always know that a death is about to happen when some nearby object\u2014a doll, a painted face\u2014starts glowing out of its eyes. And the art that kills people is uniformly bad: graffiti canvases, a stupid installation, an overpriced objet.\n\nGyllenhaal\u2019s Morf is a ridiculous figure. He\u2019s rich beyond all reason for a critic, and likes to do ostentatiously transgressive things like write naked and get very, very close to the art he is appraising. He\u2019s also a dreadful writer. Dease was \u201cusing the art to dive deep into his own psyche.\u201d He calls another exhibition a \u201csnoozefest.\u201d (In an interview, Gyllenhaal has said that he based the character on New York\u2019s Jerry Saltz.) As Morf\u2019s mind starts to disintegrate in the wake of Dease\u2019s killings from beyond the grave, the celebrated critic visits an optician, because he has started \u201cseeing things.\u201d Josephina accuses him of \u201closing his eye.\u201d\n\nSo when those horrible little eyeballs start glowing, you know that a bad artwork is about to fight back against the over-privileged human eye of the critic. Graffiti paint creeps up the body of a woman who hates graffiti, ruining her minimal aesthetic; a Brancusi-like bronze tries to crush a woman who has just gotten too rich. It\u2019s as if every painting or sculpture deemed unworthy or otherwise abused by the industry (exploited for quick cash, say, or insulted) is revolting against their overlords. The critic is the last one they\u2019ll chase, and the most significant.\n\nAs Josephina puts it in a key line, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of art if nobody sees it?\u201d Morf\u2019s \u201ceye\u201d has been imbued with too much power, which has upset the balance between artwork and viewer. In between the glamorous silliness of the Basel scenes and Morf\u2019s bespectacled antics, director Dan Gilroy appears to be making a kind of John Berger-style argument about the way we relate to visual culture. In his famous TV series Ways of Seeing, Berger posited that premodern art often presented objects on canvases (food, women, landscapes) as a kind of subservient offering to the viewer-patron. In the twentieth century, he said, the artwork retained its status as a luxury object, but became newly swaddled in the \u201cfalse mystifications\u201d of concepts so inaccessible and mysterious that they required an interpreter. \u201cWhat may become part of our language,\u201d Berger said, \u201cis jealously guarded and kept within the narrow preserves of the art expert.\u201d"

    "text": "Romantic love introduced the idea of a narrative into an individual\u2019s life\u2026. The telling of a story is one of the meanings of \u2018romance\u2019, but this story now became individualised, inserting self and other into a personal narrative which had no particular reference to wider social processes. The rise of the romantic novel more or less coincided with the emergence of the novel: the connection was one of newly discovered narrative form.\n\nA search for \u201clove\u201d in Google Books\u2019 Ngram Viewer adds weight to his theory: Use of the word peaked in the mid-1800s, coinciding neatly with the height of the romance-obsessed Victorian novel.\n\nBut on this side of the pond, contrary to that graph, the conventional wisdom is that love peaked in the 1960s\u2014specifically the \u201cSummer of Love,\u201d in 1967. I\u2019ll even go so far as to pinpoint an exact day: July 7, 1967. That\u2019s when Time magazine came out with a trippy cover featuring \u201cThe Hippies,\u201d a subculture famous for practicing \u201cfree love,\u201d and also when The Beatles released the single \u201cAll You Need Is Love.\u201d Written to be a simplistic anti-war slogan that anyone in the world could understand, the song is nonetheless a perfect example of how love can render delusional an otherwise reasonable, intelligent human being like John Lennon. Its chorus is demonstrably untrue. Love is quite far down on the list of things that humans \u201cneed\u201d\u2014in fact, it\u2019s not on the list at all. Humans need oxygen, water, and food, in that order. Everything else is optional (though clothes and shelter are nearly essential, depending on the climate). Humans are perfectly capable of living an entire life without love. Squirrels don\u2019t love and they seem to be doing just fine.\n\nAnyone who claims that \u201clove is all you need,\u201d like it\u2019s some kind of panacea, is no better than a snake-oil salesman slinging a bogus elixir. Love is at least as harmful as it is beneficial. What\u2019s odd is that our culture recognizes as much, and yet it venerates love while romanticizing the pain it can cause. Yes, we say, \u201dlove hurts, love scars, love wounds,\u201d but such are the risks. The thing is, falling in love is kind of awful, too! The symptoms are much the same as heartbreak: You can\u2019t eat because you\u2019re permanently queasy, can\u2019t sleep when she\u2019s not beside you, can\u2019t pay attention at work or think straight at all (I write and read books far less when I\u2019m infatuated with someone), and you spend most of your time crafting overwrought emails, looking at photos of her, and stalking her social media accounts. We wax lyrical about how love makes fools of us, but there is nothing admirable about being a fool.\n\nLove has certainly made a fool of me before\u2014I have the passport stamps to prove it\u2014but I can\u2019t say with certainty how many times I\u2019ve fallen in love. Maybe five times, maybe twice, maybe never. This is exactly the problem with being \u201cin love\u201d: It is the most subjective feeling in the human experience. \u201cYou\u2019ll know it when you feel it,\u201d people say. This is horseshit. I have been convinced several times of it, only for the feeling to fade (or be stomped out). Furthermore, several people who have told me \u201cyou\u2019ll know\u201d are no longer with the person who made them \u201cfeel it.\u201d The notion of \u201cone true love,\u201d that there is a single person in this world who you were meant to fall in love with, has mercifully fallen out of fashion\u2014although less because it\u2019s clearly an illogical fantasy and more because that would spell doom for many of us (what if your one true love happened to live in Papua New Guinea?). But \u201ctrue love,\u201d minus the \u201cone,\u201d somehow persists. It exists in opposition, apparently, to fleeting love\u2014to flings, crushes, and affairs. But really it\u2019s just another form of social elitism: If we believe we have found true love, we are better at life than those who have not."

    "text": "As Bezos was being applauded for his takedown of the Enquirer, Amazon was stepping up its fight with lawmakers in New York City, who had questioned the billions of dollars in tax breaks and incentives that the city and state had offered to one of the world\u2019s most successful companies. On Friday, less than 24 hours after Bezos\u2019s Medium post went live, the Post reported that Amazon was considering pulling out of New York altogether if skeptical members of the city council and state Senate didn\u2019t get on board. \u201cNo specific plans to abandon New York have been made,\u201d the Post reported. \u201cAnd it is possible that Amazon would try to use a threat to withdraw to put pressure on New York officials.\u201d\n\nIt was, as the Seattle Times\u2019 Danny Westneat noted, a different kind of extortion scheme. \u201cSure it may seem a little mobbed up when they threaten to shoot your economy, even as they\u2019re also showing up at a meeting to supposedly \u2018negotiate,\u2019\u201d Westneat wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s just business to them.\u201d That same week, Amazon signed a deal with Virginia that would grant the company generous tax breaks and incentives\u2014and would require the state to give a \u201cheads up\u201d to the company if anyone submitted Freedom of Information Act requests about the company. That\u2019s not exactly the kind of behavior you would expect from a \u201cFirst Amendment defender.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is how Amazon does business, as Seattle knows all too well. Last fall, Amazon recently halted construction of new buildings there\u2014and threatened to leave the city altogether\u2014in protest of a new tax on large companies to fund affordable housing. The Seattle area has the third-largest homeless population in the country, behind only New York and Los Angeles, according to federal statistics. But Amazon\u2019s threats got the city\u2019s attention. \u201cThat really changed things overnight,\u201d Katie Wilson, of Seattle\u2019s Transit Riders Union, told The Atlantic. \u201cPeople got scared.\u201d Westnead, in his column, cast it as another mafioso move: \u201cNice economy you\u2019ve got there, Seattle. Shame if something happened to it.\u201d The city council repealed the tax less than a month after passing it unanimously.\n\nAmazon\u2019s ruthless behavior isn\u2019t limited to its dealings with city and state governments. The company began as an online bookstore which ruthlessly undercut publishers; Bezos reportedly instructed the company to \u201capproach these small publishers the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle.\u201d While definitive data doesn\u2019t exist, Amazon is routinely blamed for the downturn in bookstores over the past two decades and the decline in author earnings. For much of its existence, the company skimped on sales tax, which it only recently began paying in all 50 states. Over the last several years, there have been a series of investigations into the poor treatment of the company\u2019s warehouse and delivery workers, who often endure long shifts in deplorable conditions\u2014sometimes literally working themselves to death.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, Amazon has proved largely immune to this negative press. Like other Big Tech companies, notably Google, it has stayed popular with the general public, even as it has become one of the most powerful entities on the planet. Polling released last fall found that Amazon was more trusted by Americans than the government and the press\u2014and that, for Democrats, it was the most trusted institution in the entire country. The low cost and convenience of Amazon surely has a lot to do with that, but Bezos\u2019s ownership of The Washington Post likely has helped, particularly with elites."

    "text": "Though Reese\u2019s arguments are compelling, he doesn\u2019t believe that this kind of reasoning is what will ultimately drive a change. He expects that to come from advances in animal-less meat technology, and from the growing problems with production of food from animals. \u201cThe ace in the hole for the inevitability of the end of animal farming,\u201d he asserts, \u201cis the incredible inefficiency of making meat, dairy, and eggs from animals.\u201d That is, an animal\u2019s body does more than produce meat\u2014it builds bones and hair, it breathes and moves and senses, all of which consume energy, so that for every one calorie of meat produced, a farm animal takes in ten calories or more. Lab-grown meat doesn\u2019t perform any of these functions, of course, and so it has a much higher caloric conversion ratio than animals, which are, in Reese\u2019s words, \u201cinefficient producers of flesh.\u201d\n\nHe profiles some of the main companies in the meatless technology field, which he hopes will take clean meat mainstream. Hampton Creek, now called JUST, creates plant-based alternatives to eggs and dairy, and wants to target average consumers, not just vegans. Impossible Foods takes an analytical approach to isolating the components and characteristics of meat, and builds plant-based versions that have more in common with animal flesh than with the veggie burgers and Tofurkeys of yore. Beyond Meat makes products similar to those from Impossible Foods, but whereas Impossible Foods was initially marketed to restaurateurs like David Chang, Beyond Meat goes for the home cooks, selling to Whole Foods and other grocery chains.\n\nFor all these companies\u2019 efforts, Reese is also aware that changing people\u2019s diets and food cultures\u2014which foods they consider delicious or luxurious, or which they incorporate into traditional dishes\u2014is a deeply social project. He recognizes that advocates for animal-free food will need to work on social change, to ensure that as the technologies continue to develop (\u201cwhich seems fairly inevitable\u201d), people actually choose to eat the products. If scientists and businesses lead, recipes must follow.\n\nReese\u2019s book isn\u2019t likely to win the hearts and palates of many meat eaters. Its tone is coolly dry, bordering on mathematical. Part of this comes from Reese\u2019s commitment to effective altruism, whose adherents say they use \u201cevidence and careful analysis to find the very best causes\u201d rather than \u201cjust doing what feels right.\u201d It might be a refreshing shift in tone from the extreme compassion and occasional sanctimony that can surround arguments for animal welfare, and it\u2019s certainly a sensible way to organize the activities of an advocacy group\u2014but as the engine of a work of nonfiction, the constant emphasis on efficiency runs a little cold. Even Reese\u2019s discussion of suffering itself is mathematical, as he calculates the amount of harm a farm does by the number of animals it keeps and the number of hours they spend there, without accounting for differences in their consciousness. He gives the suffering of a fish the same weight as the suffering of a pig.\n\nYet despite its structure and tone, the book\u2019s underlying argument itself is important. Reese makes plain that eating meat causes an enormous amount of avoidable pain and suffering, and refuses to accept ignorance as an excuse. Most people have long known that farmed chickens live in tight wire cages where they go crazy with stress, or that hogs will get so depressed that they don\u2019t fight back when nearby animals bite their tails. People who know these facts and eat meat anyway (I do both) may tell ourselves that it\u2019s just the way things are, or cultivate an internal moral firewall, refusing to think about the processes that brought our protein to our plates.\n\nReese also rejects measures intended to make eating animals a little less morally objectionable. Michael Pollan has, for instance, envisioned not the abolition but the transformation of animal farming, into a system in which animals can live outdoors, \u201cin contact with the sun, the earth, and the gaze of the farmer,\u201d and in which consumers know where their meat comes from. A neat way to make the industrial meat system kinder, he thought, might begin with simple visibility: \u201cMaybe all we need to do to redeem industrial animal agriculture in this country,\u201d he wrote in The New York Times Magazine, \u201cis to pass a law requiring that the steel and concrete walls\u201d of the slaughterhouses \u201cbe replaced with \u2026 glass.\u201d Then, surely, conditions would have to improve. Why end the practice altogether when the cruelties can be eliminated?\n\nReese concedes that some smaller specialty farms might operate more ethically than the factory behemoths, but insists that exploiting sentient beings \u201cis a moral misdeed even if those sentient beings live happy lives.\u201d Most significantly, he argues that these specialty farms provide a \u201cpsychological refuge\u201d for meat eaters, who can take solace in the fact that they sometimes eat ethically farmed meat, even though most meat isn\u2019t produced this way. By occasionally choosing the \u201chappier\u201d meat option, people are able to imagine that their choices don\u2019t contribute to the big, brutal system, that the meatballs on their kitchen table have nothing to do with those shadowy stories about deranged chickens and terrified cows.\n\nAgain, he\u2019s right. Cruelty is all but impossible to eliminate from an industrialized meat-production system that prizes profitability above all else. Up to the 1940s and \u201950s, typical animal farms in the United States were pasture-based and raised various types of animals. Now they are concentrated operations\u2014the term of art for a factory farm is a \u201cconcentrated animal feeding operation,\u201d or CAFO. This consolidation has made it possible for Americans to eat more meat, more cheaply, and it has brought horrific conditions. The current system tasks workers with stunning live birds by dunking them in electrified water and docking the tails of pigs, in settings where the primary concern is keeping costs low. (Pollan pointed out that in ancient Greece, slaughter was entrusted to priests: \u201cpriests!\u2014now we entrust the job to minimum-wage workers.\u201d) In 2018, the average American ate more than 200 pounds of red meat and poultry, a record high. The way this plentiful meat is produced is simply hard to stomach.\n\nReading Reese\u2019s book, I found myself thinking of Matthew Scully\u2019s Dominion: The Power of Man, the Suffering of Animals, and the Call to Mercy, published in 2002. Like Reese, Scully describes the abuse of animals as a moral wrong, but unlike Reese, Scully\u2019s assessment is suffused with fellow-feeling. Scully comes to the issue as a Christian (though, by his own assessment, \u201cnot a particularly pious\u201d one) and as a conservative. And so it\u2019s surprising that his book also includes scathing critiques of capitalism throughout: \u201cMy copy of the Good Book doesn\u2019t say, \u2018Go forth to selleth every creature that moveth.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t say you can baiteth and slayeth and stuffeth every thing in sight, either, let alone deducteth the costs,\u201d he writes. He criticizes his fellow conservatives for their posture in animal-welfare conversations, for their \u201clazy disdain of moral inconveniences,\u201d and their belief \u201cthat somehow the free market will right all things and any cruelty will be redeemed by the miraculous workings of capitalism.\u201d And this from a man who worked as a speechwriter for George W. Bush.\n\nIt is something of this kind of fiery radicalism that I was hoping to find in Reese\u2019s book. His idea is radical. But The End of Animal Farming proceeds blandly through its points like a slide deck at a pitch meeting. Instead of critiquing the capitalist logic that gives us factory farming, Reese proposes replacing the meat business with another, more technically advanced model. And that\u2019s fine and sensible. But it seems unlikely that such a dispassionate approach will be enough to spark the major changes in eating habits and foodways that could bring about a slaughterless future. Reese\u2019s idea\u2014that people will give up something pleasurable and familiar without the spark of something deeply felt, be it shame or compassion\u2014relies on a very generous view of the human animal."

    "text": "Despite shortcomings, Madrid did succeed in bringing all the parties in the Arab-Israeli conflict to the negotiating table for the first time. The conference launched unprecedented multilateral cooperation between Israel and the Arab world on arms control and regional security, economic development, the environment, water, and refugees. It broke a taboo of Arab officials refusing to sit with Israeli officials. Gulf states like Oman and Qatar hosted Israeli delegations in subsequent years, with a surprising amount of engagement continuing even after the demise of the Clinton-era Oslo peace process by the late 1990s.\n\n\n\nTo develop the conference, Baker spent eight months in what is known as \u201cshuttle diplomacy,\u201d consulting regional and international partners on the meeting, even co-chairing the summit with the Soviet Union. The vision of the conference was clear: to capitalize on the war\u2019s conclusion to build a foundation for regional peace, with the resolution of the Israel-Palestinian conflict as the cornerstone of the effort.\n\n\n\nCompare that kind of preparation and vision with that of the current administration. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the summit in an interview scarcely a month ahead of the actual meeting, evidently without consulting key allies, even reportedly surprising its Polish hosts: In the midst of a Middle East trip to shore up regional pressure against Iran, Pompeo suggested an important element of the conference would be \u201cmaking sure Iran is not a destabilizing influence.\u201d\n\n\n\nJust a few weeks later, after pushback from Poland as well as European allies uncomfortable using an international summit to target one country, the administration broadened the aims of the meeting to focus on a range of issues, from extremism, to missiles, to terrorism (all topics of high relevance in the Iran file). With the administration\u2019s special envoy on Iran playing an instrumental role in organizing the forum, skepticism remains about the meeting being anything other than a vehicle to pressure and isolate Iran. \u201cThe first issue on the agenda is Iran,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu said Sunday, despite the word \u201cIran,\u201d according to the BBC, appearing nowhere on the official agenda. Needless to say, Iran has not been invited, and key global and regional players like Russia, Turkey, and the Palestinians declined to attend.\n\n\n\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict is also not on the agenda, though President Trump\u2019s \u201cpeace team\u201d is reportedly attending. This decision marks another key difference with the Madrid conference. While the Bush administration\u2019s team did not believe that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was the sole or even primary source of the region\u2019s instability\u2014after all, the United States just fought Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq in a war that had nothing to do with Israel\u2014they also correctly recognized that without a resolution to the conflict, Israel would never be at peace and the region would never be stable."

    "text": "There may be no moment where it\u2019s more important to have a cleric of one\u2019s faith than at the moment of one\u2019s death. Ray, who was a devout Muslim, asked if his imam could be present instead. The state said no. He asked if the minister could be excluded from the execution chamber. The state refused that request as well. Five days after the meeting, on January 28, Ray filed a lawsuit in federal court to halt his execution. He argued that the prison\u2019s policy violated federal religious-discrimination laws as well as the First Amendment\u2019s Establishment Clause, which forbids government officials from elevating one faith or denomination above another.\n\n\n\nAlabama responded by citing the court\u2019s need to maintain prison safety and control who is present during an execution. The state also waived its requirement that the prison chaplain be present in the execution chamber when officials administered a lethal injection to Ray. But this merely changed the discrimination instead of curing it: A Protestant Christian prisoner would still be able to have a cleric of their faith by their side when they died, while those from other denominations and faiths would not.\n\nThe district court denied Ray\u2019s appeal on timeliness grounds on February 1. Ray had told the court he only learned about the policy five days before he filed the lawsuit, and Alabama offered no evidence to the contrary. Despite this, the judge ruled that Ray should have filed the complaint after the state set the execution date in November. On Wednesday, a three-judge panel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals overruled that decision and stayed Ray\u2019s execution until it could gather more evidence. Judge Stanley Marcus wrote that \u201cit looks substantially likely to us that Alabama has run afoul of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority, in quashing the panel\u2019s stay on Thursday and letting the state of Alabama kill Ray hours later, offered no explanation beyond a short, unsigned statement that cited the late timing of the appeal. So it\u2019s unclear why they ruled as they did. But Kagan\u2019s dissent shows how they made three unjustifiable decisions along the way. First, the majority didn\u2019t just let the execution go ahead on schedule; they squelched the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s effort to find out more facts before rendering a final judgment. \u201cThe Eleventh Circuit wanted to hear that claim in full,\u201d Kagan explained. \u201cInstead, this Court short-circuits that ordinary process\u2014and itself rejects the claim with little briefing and no argument\u2014just so the State can meet its preferred execution date.\u201d In doing so, the majority sent the message that the convenience of state officials ranks higher than the religious-freedom claims of a condemned prisoner.\n\nSecond, the majority did not acknowledge that Alabama had come nowhere near proving its case. The state had to justify its religious discrimination by proving it had exhausted all other options when pursuing the \u201ccompelling interest\u201d of prison security; it did not. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t Ray\u2019s imam receive whatever training in execution protocol the Christian chaplain received?\u201d Kagan asked in her dissent. \u201cThe State has no answer. Why wouldn\u2019t it be sufficient for the imam to pledge, under penalty of contempt, that he will not interfere with the State\u2019s ability to perform the execution? The State doesn\u2019t say.\u201d Nor does the majority, which stuck to the procedural aspects of the case."

    "text": "A particularly contentious aspect of the legal process has been the preventive custody of Cuixart, S\u00e1nchez, Junqueras, and six others, who have all waited in jail for a trial whose date was only announced days before it was due to begin. The Spanish authorities have argued that their incarceration was due to flight risk\u2014seven Catalan leaders fled abroad after the referendum to Belgium, Scotland and Switzerland\u2014and to prevent continued illegal activities. But the trial delays since then have made the measure look increasingly excessive.\n\nAnother controversial feature is the rebellion charge against nine defendants. Rebellion is legally defined as \u201crising up, violently and publicly\u201d against the Spanish state\u2014 the last conviction followed an attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in 1981. The Catalan independence movement, despite its many faults, has been characterized by peaceful protest. There have been some violent incidents, such as police cars being vandalized or a well-known unionist journalist being punched while he was live on air, but these have been rare, and never linked to the movement\u2019s leaders themselves.\n\nIronically, the most violent scenes of the independence push were caused by Spanish riot police on the day of the 2017 referendum. Targeting several of the improvised voting stations, they smashed windows and doors, dragging some voters away and beating others. The Spanish interior ministry has refused to probe the actions of its police officers on that day. Barcelona\u2019s leftist city hall has brought a lawsuit against 33 of them.\n\nThe Spanish judiciary does have a history of overreaction. The Audiencia Nacional, a court dedicated to countering terrorism and organized crime, has in the last two years issued jail sentences against several hip-hop artists due to the content of their songs and social media accounts. Among them is Josep Miquel Arenas, a young rapper known as Valt\u00f2nyc, who was given a three-and-a-half-year sentence for glorifying terrorism and insulting the monarchy in his angry, anti-establishment songs. Shortly before beginning his sentence last year Arenas fled to Belgium. The Spanish authorities are now trying to extradite him. Rapper Pablo Has\u00e9l was given a two-year jail sentence on similar charges last year, for the content of several tweets and the lyrics to one of his songs. The sentence was subsequently reduced to nine months on appeal.\n\nJoaquim Bosch, a magistrate and outspoken critic of the Spanish justice system, has warned of \u201can obvious erosion of freedom of speech\u201d in Spain. Jueces para la Democracia (Judges for Democracy), the progressive magistrates\u2019 association he represents, argues that Spanish laws are too vague on issues of terrorism or hate speech, giving free rein to over-zealous investigators.\n\nThe recent spate of freedom of speech cases is grist to the mill of the Catalan independence movement, which runs a slick PR machine. Arenas, for example, has been photographed several times posing with former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont\u2014who oversaw the 2017 independence referendum and fled to Belgium shortly afterward\u2014since they both left Spain. In addition, there have been a handful of other cases which have cast in doubt the judiciary\u2019s independence from political interference.\n\nIn November, the Supreme Court performed an unprecedented U-turn. Having recently ruled that banks, not customers, should pay a mortgage tax, the court changed its mind, drawing accusations that it had caved in to pressures from the country\u2019s financial powers.\n\nWeeks later, in a separate case, Supreme Court magistrate Manuel Marchena withdrew his candidacy to head up Spain\u2019s judicial governing body. A leaked text message from a conservative senator had emerged, apparently gloating at the fact that Marchena\u2019s appointment would allow the right-wing Popular Party to control the court \u201cfrom behind the scenes.\u201d Marchena will nonetheless preside the panel of judges handling the Catalan independence leaders\u2019 trial.\n\nAs a result, it has been easy for secessionists to present their conflict with Spain as one upholding democracy against repression. Yet in pursuing their dream of an independent republic, Catalan nationalists have occasionally neglected their much-vaunted democratic values.\n\nIn 2015, the pro-independence Catalan government treated a regional election as a plebiscite on the secession issue. In it, pro-independence parties won a narrow majority of seats in the regional parliament but fell short of a majority of the popular vote. Nonetheless, secessionists pushed ahead with their divisive roadmap as if they had secured an overwhelming mandate. Then, in September 2017, the pro-independence majority rode roughshod over parliamentary protocol to ram through laws laying the groundwork for the October referendum.\n\nFor Joan Coscubiela, a member of the Catalan parliament for the leftist Catalunya S\u00ed que es Pot (Catalonia Yes We Can) coalition at the time, those parliamentary sessions \u201cended up installing in people\u2019s minds the idea that democracy means the majority can do whatever they like, even if it means breaking the rules [and] trampling over the rights of the minority.\u201d\n\nMany Catalans have been dismayed at how the issue of separation from Spain has dominated their region\u2019s political debate, distracting attention from more urgent matters, such as public healthcare and education.\n\nThe upcoming trial could see the figureheads of Catalonia\u2019s failed independence bid pay a high price for such single-mindedness. But Spain\u2019s judiciary will be up for evaluation as well. Spanish authorities have rejected calls for international observers, insisting that the justice system offers the guarantees and transparency necessary for such a high-pressure legal process. This trial\u2019s ability to deliver on that promise could tell us a good deal about the health of Spanish democracy\u2014and whether or not worries about it are justified."

    "text": "To show a clear trend, Marcusa would ideally want to find towns to compare the M\u00e9tlaoui/Sidi Bouzid divergence to outside Tunisia. But that\u2019s difficult to do in other areas struggling with Jihadi-Salafism, as the labor movement has traditionally been repressed in those countries. Unlike Tunisia, where 670,000 workers went on strike just last week, other countries across the Middle East do not have the same unbroken history of labor activism.\n\nIn oil-rich Iraq, the country that in 2017 suffered more terrorist attacks than any other nation, one would expect to find many M\u00e9tlaoui-type towns: Iraq has a long labor history, with union support instrumental to its independence in 1958. However, the labor movement there is only recently showing signs of strength and rebirth after a long period of suppression under Saddam Hussein, as well as the flood of corruption and mismanagement that followed the U.S. invasion in 2003.\n\nIraq\u2019s sweeping changes to its labor laws in 2015, including the country\u2019s first sexual harassment protections and reinstating the formerly banned right to strike, represent progress. But Saddam\u2019s shadow remains\u2013the continued prohibition of unionizing among civil servants means it\u2019s still not living up to the International Labor Organization standards of freedom of association it ratified in June 2018. Considering that Iraq\u2019s public sector employs over 40 percent of the country\u2019s working age population, that represents a significant number of silenced voices.\n\nLabor unions\u2019 effectiveness in Iraq can be illustrated by the enemies they have made. Soon after the invasion of Iraq, Hadi Saleh, the head of the newly-formed Iraqi Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU)\u2013its largest union federation\u2013was murdered by insurgents in his home. When ISIS invaded Mosul in 2014, they stormed IFTU offices. Years of U.S. State Department Human Rights reports show the labor movement sounding the alarm on the Iraqi state\u2019s deep corruption. The same reports show multiple instances of the state interfering with union work and in many cases raiding union offices.\n\n\u201c[Iraq\u2019s unions] are used to shouting\u2014not in a bad way, but loudly\u2014in order to inform the government: We are your friends. We are not your enemy. We want to work with you in order to build democracy, in order to have proper industries that work for everybody,\u201d said Abdullah Muhsin, an activist in Iraq\u2019s post-war labor movement who is now an international officer for the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT) in the UK.\n\nTo Muhsin, the nonsectarian nature of union organizing is a clear antidote to the divisions that have riven the country. The government\u2019s anti-union stance is, among other things, an obstacle in fighting extremism. \u201cIf unions were allowed to do their job and be considered as a partner,\u201d Muhsin told me, \u201cwe would not have seen these problems. Because unions are working from below, they are workers, they are in factories, in schools, in communities, they have eyes everywhere.\u201d\n\nMuhsin isn\u2019t alone in thinking strong civic organizations can make a difference fighting extremism. During the Obama Administration, a core pillar of \u201cCountering Violent Extremism\u201d or CVE, (the catch-all term for addressing terrorism\u2019s root causes) was the need to strengthen civil society, from women\u2019s groups to marginalized communities and organized labor. The term \u201ccivil society\u201d has cropped up in every president\u2019s national security strategy post 9/11. What the term lacks is specificity\u2014where exactly to focus in civil society. And that\u2019s the gap studies like Marcusa\u2019s seek to fill.\n\nHeba El-Shazli, a professor at George Mason University\u2019s School of Policy, Government and International Affairs (SPGIA) said that the lack of attention to unions today differs from policy in previous decades, citing U.S. support for the Solidarity movement in Poland during the Cold War. A 28-year veteran of international labor issues, El-Shazli lamented unionism\u2019s relative absence from today\u2019s foreign policy debate, \u201cIt\u2019s really outrageous that it\u2019s just not on the radar. It really is.\u201d She wonders whether the overall decline of unions as a power in American society today means that policymakers no longer consider their strengths overseas. If so, however, that\u2019s \u201cshort-sighted,\u201d she told me.\n\nIt\u2019s too simplistic to say that more union activity will vanquish extremism in the Middle East, but there\u2019s ample evidence at this point that this and similar approaches might help. Inserting these findings into foreign policy is a matter of politics. Republican administrations have not traditionally been strong union supporters, but such recent research might interest the ascendant and vocal progressive wing of the Democratic party, who have previously been criticized for being insufficiently focused on international affairs.\n\nEncouraging countries explicitly to support their unions might seem to some like a pie in the sky idea. But after almost $6 trillion spent on an unwinnable war, and with ever-decreasing appetite in the United States for military solutions, surely it\u2019s worth trying something new."

    "text": "Few of the Democrats\u2019 targets for congressional oversight rank higher than Whitaker. Trump ousted Jeff Sessions as attorney general in November and tapped Whitaker, Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, to serve in an acting capacity. Whitaker\u2019s past criticism of the Russia investigation raised serious concerns that he would use his temporary position to bend the Justice Department to the president\u2019s whims. Next week, the Senate will likely confirm Bill Barr to serve as the next attorney general, giving Democrats only a brief window to question Whitaker while he serves in the post.\n\nIn Friday\u2019s hearing, Whitaker offered only a half-hearted defense of the Justice Department\u2019s traditional independence. \u201cAt no time has the White House asked for, nor have I provided, any promises or commitments concerning the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation, or any other investigation,\u201d he asserted in his opening statement. But he also declined to defend the Russia investigation\u2019s legitimacy as Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Chris Wray have publicly done. \u201cAre you overseeing a witch hunt?\u201d asked Representative Steve Cohen. \u201cIt would be inappropriate for me to talk about an ongoing investigation,\u201d Whitaker replied. Like many of the president\u2019s other subordinates, his performance appeared tailored to an audience of one.\n\nWhitaker gave the committee some assurances under oath about his handling of the inquiry. \u201cI have not talked to the president about the special counsel\u2019s investigation,\u201d he told lawmakers who expressed concern about whether he gave inside information to the White House. He also said that while he had been briefed on the investigation\u2019s actions, he had not changed its course. \u201cThere has been no event or decision that has required me to take any action, and I have not interfered in any way with the special counsel\u2019s investigation,\u201d Whitaker testified. Under the Justice Department\u2019s regulations, the attorney general is required to notify Congress if he or she countermands a special counsel.\n\nOther responses raised more questions than answers. Whitaker demurred when Val Demings, a Florida Democrat, asked whether he had discussed the federal investigation in the Southern District of New York. \u201cI am not going to discuss my private conversations with the president of the United States,\u201d he told her. He also admitted that he had only interviewed for two jobs in the Trump administration: to be Trump\u2019s in-house attorney for responding to the Russia investigation, and the chief of staff position under Sessions. At the end of the hearing, Nadler said Whitaker\u2019s testimony was \u201cnot credible\u201d and that he might call him back before the committee to give a closed-door deposition.\n\n\u201cThis administration is used to evading any questions they want to evade. They\u2019re used to not having to answer the questions,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju. \u201cWe\u2019re going to pursue them we\u2019re going to show them that era is over and that the questions.\u201d"

    "text": "The majority of parents who reject these requirements today, however, aren\u2019t from vulnerable groups. They\u2019re opting out for their own religious or personal beliefs. Parents aren\u2019t legally allowed to do that in every state, but can in the two states experiencing major measles outbreaks. Religious exemptions are permitted in New York, where the outbreak is primarily affecting the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community. Both personal and religious exemptions are allowed in Washington, which according to one infectious disease researcher has become \u201ca major anti-vaccine hot spot due to non-medical vaccine exemptions that have nothing to do with religion.\u201d\n\nimmune.org\n\nRoutine childhood vaccination programs have been shown to prevent approximately 42,000 early deaths and 20 million cases of disease per year, saving $13.5 billion in direct costs. That\u2019s why non-medical exemption laws are opposed by the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Infectious Diseases Society of America\u2014basically every reputable medical organization out there. But nearly every state has them in some form. There is also \u201ctremendous variability in the rigor with which such beliefs must be proved or documented,\u201d according to the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS). In some states, \u201cparents simply need to state that \u2018their religion\u2019 is against vaccination to be granted an exemption, even though no major religions specifically discourage vaccination.\u201d\n\nThese problems are being compounded by the growth of the anti-vaccine movement, which argues that vaccines are more dangerous than the government and medical community claim, and thus no vaccines should be mandatory. Neither their facts nor their logic holds up. \u201cParents cannot be exempted from placing infants in car seats simply because they do not \u2018believe\u2019 in them,\u201d argues PIDS. States also don\u2019t allow belief exemptions for laws intended to protect other people, like driving a car without a license. \u201cWhether or not children should be vaccinated before childcare or school entry ought not be a matter of \u2018belief,\u2019\u201d the group argues. \u201cRather, it should be a matter of public policy based on the best available scientific evidence, and in this case the science is definitive: vaccines are safe and they save lives.\u201d\n\nSo why doesn\u2019t Congress just pass a vaccination law outlawing non-medical exemptions? \u201cWe would love it if they could do something at the federal level,\u201d said Rich Greenaway, the director of operations for the advocacy group Vaccinate Your Family. \u201cWe\u2019d be 100 percent behind it.\u201d But it\u2019s not clear that Congress has that legal authority. According to the Congressional Research Service, \u201cthe preservation of the public health has been the primary responsibility of state and local governments, and the authority to enact laws relevant to the protection of the public health derives from the state\u2019s general police powers.\u201d Creating a federal vaccination law would turn that historical precedent on its head.\n\nA federal vaccination law would also set the stage for a fierce legal battle with vaccine opponents that would almost certainly make its way to the Supreme Court. The risk of losing that battle, while providing a major platform for anti-vaxxers, might not be worth it. Besides, the state\u2019s authority to set vaccination requirements was already confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court over 100 years ago, and federal lawmakers also don\u2019t have much interest in taking that authority away, Greenaway said. \u201cThe legislators at the federal level, they kind of know that their states want to handle this and they step back from it.\u201d"

    "text": "The case hinges on a single phrase in the E-Government Act of 2002. The statute authorizes the judiciary to levy fees \u201conly to the extent necessary\u201d to provide \u201caccess to information available through automatic data processing equipment.\u201d Though data storage costs have plummeted over the past two decades, PACER\u2019s fees rose from seven cents a page at its establishment to ten cents a page by 2011, which remains the cost today. That may not sound like much, but it adds up fast. The PACER system itself brought in more than $146 million in fees during the 2016 fiscal year, even though it cost just over $3 million to operate.\n\n\u201cAnyone who wants to be able to access the documents that are essential to understanding the way our court system works has to pay these fees,\u201d Brianne Gorod, the chief counsel at the Constitutional Accountability Center, told me. The organization filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of former Senator Joe Lieberman, the 2002 law\u2019s original sponsor. \u201cWhat that means is that one\u2019s ability to access these documents\u2014to read the briefs that the courts use when making decisions, to understand why courts are doing what they do\u2014is going to turn on one\u2019s financial situation.\u201d\n\nThe government countered that Congress gave the courts broad discretion to levy fees that would fund the judiciary\u2019s entire slate of public access services. \u201cNotably, this authorization makes no mention of PACER,\u201d Justice Department lawyers told the district court. What did those funds go toward? Between 2010 and 2016, the judiciary spent $185 million in PACER fees to fund a variety of improvements to courtroom technology; $75 million went toward automated notices for creditors in bankruptcy cases during that same time period; and another $3.5 million funded Violent Crime Control Act notifications to local law enforcement agencies.\n\nLast March, federal judge Ellen Segal Huvelle took a Solomonic approach. She refused to endorse the government\u2019s sweeping interpretation of the E-Government Act or the plaintiffs\u2019 narrow version. Nonetheless, she ruled that some of the judiciary\u2019s expenditures went beyond what Congress had authorized. Using PACER fees to fund electronic filing access for lawyers and send out automated bankruptcy notices survived scrutiny; expenditures like a web portal for prospective jurors and a study on electronic filings in Mississippi state courts did not. The plaintiffs and the government both asked the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals to review the decision.\n\nIn his friend-of-the-court brief, Lieberman argued that the lower court had misinterpreted the law and its intent. He speaks with some authority on the matter, having introduced the Senate\u2019s version of the E-Government Act and overseen its passage as a committee chairman. In his filing, Lieberman warned that excessive PACER fees would \u201cimpose a serious financial barrier to members of the public who wish to access court records, and these fees thereby create a system in which rich and poor do not have equal access to important government documents.\u201d"

    "text": "But there is a different way of viewing history, according to which historical events do not happen out of necessity. Contingency and chance, instead, are the order of the day. For Friedrich Nietzsche, part of a younger generation of German philosophers writing toward the end of the nineteenth century, any talk of necessity smacked of a discredited Christian view of the world, according to which there is a pre-ordained structure to the universe. Instead, he believed that events in history have many different and unrelated sources, and that outcomes are often down to contingent factors. In this picture, individuals are a part of the motor of history\u2014not merely the passengers. Or to put it another way: If you \u201ckill baby Hitler,\u201d as the Internet debated in 2015 and again last month, perhaps the Holocaust doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nThe sheer catalogue of things that had to happen in order for the UK to be in its current position supports this Nietzschean view of history. Back in 2015, David Cameron was running for prime minister for the second time, having promised an \u201cIn\u2014Out\u201d referendum on the UK\u2019s EU membership as part of his party\u2019s manifesto. At the time, many believed that there was going to be a \u201chung parliament,\u201d and that Cameron\u2019s Conservatives would have to form a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats, who were unlikely to agree to such a risky referendum. Defying the polls, however, the Conservatives won a parliamentary majority. Cameron promised to negotiate a better deal with the EU before calling the referendum. Despite getting most of what he asked for from the EU, the focus was on what he didn\u2019t get\u2014the right to an emergency stop to European immigration.\n\nMuch has been written about the uninspiring campaign the \u201cRemain\u201d side fought during the public debate leading up to the referendum. Even the \u201cRemain\u201d name retrospectively seemed the dullest possible choice, offering no vision other than the bleak picture it painted of the UK\u2019s future outside the EU.\n\nBut even after the result was declared, 52 percent to 48 in favor of leaving the union, the future of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU was still wide open. Once Cameron resigned as prime minister, arch Brexiter Boris Johnson, widely considered to be the next leader of the Conservative party, was reassuring Remain voters that the UK would continue to trade freely with the EU\u2019s single market, something possible only under a so-called soft-Brexit. Just a week after the referendum result, during the very speech in which everyone anticipated Johnson would announce his candidacy, he did the opposite and withdrew from the race. Fellow Brexiter Michael Gove, until then Johnson\u2019s supporter, had decided to run for leader himself. Eventually that left two candidates standing, Andrea Leadsom and Theresa May. In an interview with The Times of London, however, Leadsom disqualified herself with a comment many interpreted as her claiming that being a mother made her a better candidate than May, who has no children. Gaffes and strategic mistakes decided who the UK\u2019s next prime minister would be.\n\nAnother memorable quote from The History Boys belongs to the only female teacher: \u201cHistory,\u201d she declares, \u201cis women following behind, with a bucket!\u201d There is some truth to that in May\u2019s case. She inherited the mess that Cameron and Brexit Boys Johnson and Gove left behind. However, today\u2019s Brexit fiasco also bears May\u2019s personal stamp. Perhaps as an attempt to pre-empt suspicion that she, who opposed leaving the EU, would thwart Brexit, or perhaps out of a sense of duty to the electorate, she interpreted the referendum result as demanding the severance of all ties with the EU\u2019s institutions, thus emboldening the hard Brexiters who are now causing much of the parliamentary gridlock in the struggle to approve the negotiated exit deal. Then, too, perhaps more than any negotiation, the one with the EU required a degree of flexibility, bargaining and consensus-building back in the UK, none of these being among May\u2019s strengths."

    "text": "Schultz has other advantages. Much of the mainstream media, and especially the Beltway press, is uncomfortable with political polarization\u2014and very comfortable with moderates and rich people. Thus, Schultz \u201cgot a super-cushy red carpet for his possible 2020 presidential run ... despite his lack of political experience,\u201d argued The Washington Post\u2019s Margaret Sullivan. \u201cWhy do journalists and news organizations insist on doing this? I think the answer is pretty clear. It\u2019s because they want to appear fair without taking any chances.\u201d At Daily Kos, Eric Boehlert wrote that \u201cSchultz is clearly benefiting from our Davos-style political culture, where billionaires are automatically held up as symbols of what is right and just. And if a billionaire raises his hand and says he wants become president without facing any primary-season opponents, the media parts like the Red Sea and prepares a seat for him in front of an eager television host.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo Schultz does pose an electoral threat for Democrats, even if his bid ultimately fails. Over the past two years, Democrats from all ideological persuasions have begun to unite around a leftist agenda on universal health care, gun control, economic redistribution, and climate change. While there are serious disagreements about how these policies would be enacted, the party has largely turned its back on the triangulation and incrementalism of the Clinton years and promoted bold progressivism as an antidote to Trumpism. A Schultz candidacy would erase that neat binary in a general election.\n\n\n\nSchultz has center-right instincts. He believes that the two parties have made it difficult for Americans to talk about\u2014and therefore fix\u2014divisive social issues like racism, and sees private industry as both an engine of change and a safety net for workers. He is, as HuffPost\u2019s Zach Carter wrote earlier this week, exactly the kind of elite figure that would have been feted by Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich alike during the heady days of the 1990s: \u201cSince the government was too clunky and inefficient to spend money wisely, according to this orthodoxy, it was best to get deficits down through spending cuts, rather than tax increases, although a slight hike for the richest households could be stomached for the sake of appearances.\u201d\n\n\n\nSchultz won\u2019t compete in the Democratic primary because, he says, he doesn\u2019t believe in universal health care or free college, but it\u2019s also because he knows can\u2019t win the party\u2019s nomination. The question is whether his positions\u2014few though they may be at this stage\u2014are broadly popular. The evidence is that they\u2019re not. Polling shows majority support for universal health care and taxing the rich, while almost no one thinks the national debt, Schultz\u2019s hobbyhorse, is the most important problem in America. And that\u2019s about all we know about Schultz\u2019s platform. Despite having formed a political team months ago, he has no policy proposals whatsoever\u2014including about how to pay down the national debt.\n\n\n\nRather than treating him as a potential spoiler, Democrats should portray Schultz as emblematic of everything wrong with Trump\u2019s America. His opposition to taxing the wealth, support for cutting entitlements, and belief that plutocrats can solve the country\u2019s pressing problems make him the perfect villain. This is smart politics, as New York magazine\u2019s Eric Levitz argued on Thursday, \u201cThere\u2019s little to no evidence that railing against \u2018the billionaire class\u2019 hurts Democrats electorally by making them sound too \u2018far left.\u2019... Meanwhile, there is significant evidence that the deployment of populist, \u2018us versus them\u2019 rhetoric increases the salience of class resentments in U.S. elections\u2014and thus, increases the Democratic Party\u2019s share of the vote.\u201d\n\n"

He has warned of an \u201cinvasion of foreigners,\u201d argued a German minister should be \u201cdisposed of\u201d in Turkey, and echoed an address Hitler gave in 1933 by writing a column attacking members of the \u201cglobalized class,\u201d or \u201crootless, international clique.\u201d\n\nHe is also the moderate face of the Alternative for Germany (AfD)\u2013the country\u2019s anti-migrant right and, since 2017, its largest opposition party in parliament. Since its 2013 founding, the party has struggled to move past the Sieg Heil crowd and simple xenophobia that tends to accrue to its official euroskeptic platform. Last month, at the party\u2019s conference in Riesa, Saxony, co-leader Gauland went a step further, discarding even the most recent party manifesto\u2019s calls for \u201cDexit\u201d (a German Brexit). The result, however, has been a schism, the more rabid party members splitting to form a more reliably extremist corps. At a moment when the party seeks to build a transnational right-wing alliance ahead of European Parliament elections in May, these internal politics could have an outsized effect on the trajectory of Europe\u2019s resurgent right.\n\nGauland distilled the AfD\u2019s new tone into a 20-minute speech in Riesa last month, where sporting his signature tweed, he delivered a typical takedown of Brussels \u201cpaternalism.\u201d The bloc\u2019s 28 nations are \u201csqueezed into a corset,\u201d Gauland said, meandering through nationalist references to Nietzsche, Franz Josef Strauss, and Otto von Bismarck. He compared the EU to Hitler\u2014a guaranteed crowd-pleaser, in short, from a party whose foundation was predicated on the abolishment of the Euro. But in a new move, Gauland also questioned the party manifesto\u2019s call for an exit from the bloc altogether by 2024, should its immigration demands be ignored. \u201cWhoever plays with the idea of Dexit must ask,\u201d he said: \u201cIsn\u2019t that a Utopia? And shouldn\u2019t we be realistic?\u201d\n\nGermans are overwhelmingly pro-EU: a May 2018 poll found 79 percent would vote to remain in the bloc if given a British-style referendum. Even in Saxony, the AfD\u2019s former-East German stronghold, a huge majority would oppose Dexit. But Gauland\u2019s speech reflected more than political pragmatism. It marked an apex in a growing fight for control of the AfD, between Gauland\u2019s so-called moderates and a more radical wing of the party, led by Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, a Thuringian statesman who has publicly denounced Berlin\u2019s Holocaust memorial as a \u201cmonument of shame\u201d and has advocated for a \u201c180-degree turn\u201d in attitudes to the Second World War. In 2016, H\u00f6cke came under fire for a speech in the city of Erfurt, in which he demanded Angela Merkel be \u201cremoved from the Chancellory in a straitjacket\u201d for her open-door policy on immigration."

    "text": "Lyonne\u2019s strongest muscles as an actress are sardonic detachment and antsy discomfort, and she flexes both in full force in these early scenes. Instead of enjoying her f\u00eate, Nadia does several shots and desperately skulks around the room hunting for someone to leave with. She finally lands on a misogynist blowhard professor named Mike (Jeremy Bobb). She drags him first to a bodega, and then back to her own apartment a few blocks away for mediocre sex until she grows bored and kicks him out. What we learn from these brief scenes is that Nadia has a severe block when it comes to human connections. She is a devout loner, a woman who prefers the solitude of the bathroom mirror to a party, who blots out her nights with anonymous sex and obliterating substances, whose default settings are caustic and surly. Lyonne is not a wispy mover; she is lead-footed, walking with a slightly bowlegged, clomping gait that can make her look like a dizzy marionette. She is a brilliant physical comedian, the kind that a silent film director might have called a real scamp. Her heavy body language reaffirms Nadia\u2019s internal weight; she\u2019s carrying around a lot of baggage, dragging it behind her everywhere she goes like an invisible carcass.\n\nThe first time we watch Nadia die, she is going out for cigarettes after the professor leaves. She forgets to look both ways before stepping into the street, and a taxi barrels into her body, sending her flying onto the pavement. A pool of blood seeps out from her head, as her empty saucer eyes stare right into the camera lens. And then, the screen goes black, we hear the opening strains of \u201cGotta Get Up,\u201d and suddenly Nadia is back in Maxine\u2019s disco bathroom, her body fully intact and without a scratch. And the cycle begins again.\n\nFor anyone familiar with Groundhog Day, Nadia\u2019s purgatorial limbo should feel familiar. The show even borrows directly from that film: She always comes back to life with an increasingly cloying pop song (in Groundhog Day, Bill Murray knows he\u2019s alive again when his alarm clock plays \u201cI\u2019ve Got You Babe\u201d); she befriends a homeless man whom she tries to save from freezing to death (Murray\u2019s homeless friend was named \u201cPop,\u201d Nadia\u2019s is called \u201cHorse\u201d); she goes through the same process of confusion followed by elation when she learns that she is doomed to repeat the same day dozens of times. Both the show and the film follow a flawed, selfish person who interprets their looping as a kind of divine punishment, a lesson designed by some supernatural force to teach them compassion and tenderness.\n\nAnd yet, Russian Doll diverges from Groundhog Day in important ways. For one, it doesn\u2019t shy away from the trauma involved in dying repeatedly\u2014Nadia experiences each one of her deaths as the painful tragedy it is. When she falls down a flight of stairs and breaks her neck, it\u2019s brutal and terrifying. When she goes to visit her late mother\u2019s friend Ruth, who acts as her surrogate mother, and Ruth accidentally shoots her thinking she is a burglar, she weeps as she sees Ruth\u2019s agonized face. What Nadia realizes, as she reboots, is that there may be simultaneous dimensions, and in each one that she has left behind, she\u2019s still dead, and that she is leaving a mounting wake of tragedies and bloody messes and consequences. Groundhog Day treated Phil Connors\u2019s infinite rebirths as quirky comedic fodder; Russian Doll immediately undercuts this premise. Nadia\u2019s deaths are horrible, every single time. When she dies in a gas explosion in Ruth\u2019s apartment, Ruth explodes too\u2014her endless spiral brings a body count. Nadia carries the trauma of every fresh death with her, until she can barely look at herself in the mirror anymore.\n\nBut\u2014and this is the case with all of Headland\u2019s most cutting work\u2014the show doesn\u2019t torture Nadia just for the fun of it. There is a reason she is trapped; she was trapped even before she started dying. Throughout the show, we learn that Nadia\u2019s mother (Chlo\u00eb Sevigny) was dangerous, mentally ill to the point where she could not be trusted with a knife. Lyonne reveals Nadia\u2019s painful childhood slowly, in jerky monologues that drip out of her throat like acrid syrup. Nadia believes, deep down, that her mother died young because of her decision not to live with her after child services got involved, and she has shouldered that burden all her life, remaining distant and standoffish when it comes to intimacy."

    "text": "The majority of parents who reject these requirements today, however, aren\u2019t from vulnerable groups. They\u2019re opting out for their own religious or personal beliefs. Parents aren\u2019t legally allowed to do that in every state, but can in the two states experiencing major measles outbreaks. Religious exemptions are permitted in New York, where the outbreak is primarily affecting the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community. Both personal and religious exemptions are allowed in Washington, which according to one infectious disease researcher has become \u201ca major anti-vaccine hot spot due to non-medical vaccine exemptions that have nothing to do with religion.\u201d\n\nimmune.org\n\nRoutine childhood vaccination programs have been shown to prevent approximately 42,000 early deaths and 20 million cases of disease per year, saving $13.5 billion in direct costs. That\u2019s why non-medical exemption laws are opposed by the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Infectious Diseases Society of America\u2014basically every reputable medical organization out there. But nearly every state has them in some form. There is also \u201ctremendous variability in the rigor with which such beliefs must be proved or documented,\u201d according to the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS). In some states, \u201cparents simply need to state that \u2018their religion\u2019 is against vaccination to be granted an exemption, even though no major religions specifically discourage vaccination.\u201d\n\nThese problems are being compounded by the growth of the anti-vaccine movement, which argues that vaccines are more dangerous than the government and medical community claim, and thus no vaccines should be mandatory. Neither their facts nor their logic holds up. \u201cParents cannot be exempted from placing infants in car seats simply because they do not \u2018believe\u2019 in them,\u201d argues PIDS. States also don\u2019t allow belief exemptions for laws intended to protect other people, like driving a car without a license. \u201cWhether or not children should be vaccinated before childcare or school entry ought not be a matter of \u2018belief,\u2019\u201d the group argues. \u201cRather, it should be a matter of public policy based on the best available scientific evidence, and in this case the science is definitive: vaccines are safe and they save lives.\u201d\n\nSo why doesn\u2019t Congress just pass a vaccination law outlawing non-medical exemptions? \u201cWe would love it if they could do something at the federal level,\u201d said Rich Greenaway, the director of operations for the advocacy group Vaccinate Your Family. \u201cWe\u2019d be 100 percent behind it.\u201d But it\u2019s not clear that Congress has that legal authority. According to the Congressional Research Service, \u201cthe preservation of the public health has been the primary responsibility of state and local governments, and the authority to enact laws relevant to the protection of the public health derives from the state\u2019s general police powers.\u201d Creating a federal vaccination law would turn that historical precedent on its head.\n\nA federal vaccination law would also set the stage for a fierce legal battle with vaccine opponents that would almost certainly make its way to the Supreme Court. The risk of losing that battle, while providing a major platform for anti-vaxxers, might not be worth it. Besides, the state\u2019s authority to set vaccination requirements was already confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court over 100 years ago, and federal lawmakers also don\u2019t have much interest in taking that authority away, Greenaway said. \u201cThe legislators at the federal level, they kind of know that their states want to handle this and they step back from it.\u201d"

    "text": "But ALEC remains a powerful force. Yes, some companies have left, but the majority of its members are still there, including many trade associations of which the defecting companies are a part\u2014and some anti-ALEC advocates warn that the diminished influence of more moderate companies has allowed ALEC to shift ever more to the right. Yes, Democrats have taken back power in key ALEC strongholds, but Republicans still hold total control in 22 states. And because of power-grab bills in states that did buck unified Republican control in 2018, it\u2019s clear that incoming Democratic governors won\u2019t have as much power as ALEC-backed governors did in the same seats.\n\nPrecedent suggests that these laws will be successful. When Democratic Governor Roy Cooper\u2019s election in 2016 ended three years of Republican control in North Carolina, legislators enacted several bills diminishing his power. In the two years that Cooper has been in office, the Republican-dominated legislature has overridden 29 of the governor\u2019s vetoes. Last year, when a reporter asked state Senate Majority Leader Phil Berger about any further plans to strip the governor\u2019s power, he replied, laughing, \u201cDoes he still have any?\u201d According to CMD, 28 of North Carolina\u2019s legislators have ties to ALEC.\n\n\u201cALEC teaches state lawmakers to think about policy not as a way of solving problems but as a way of building political power,\u201d explained Alex Hertel-Fernandez, who recently published State Capture, a book about ALEC and other conservative policy groups. According to Hertel-Fernandez, the difficulty of undoing ALEC\u2019s handiwork through elections is not a side effect of the group\u2019s policy strategy, but an essential aim. The broad reach of ALEC, along with the State Policy Network and Americans for Prosperity, has made this anti-democratic approach to policymaking a crucial part, he argues, of what it \u201cmean[s] to be a conservative, pro-business state legislator.\u201d\n\nBy focusing on policy areas that target the very landscape of who gets to have power, these groups have essentially guaranteed that the tide, if it turns against them, will do so slowly and painstakingly. Thanks to ALEC-backed gerrymandering legislation in Michigan, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, for example, Republicans retained state legislative control in November, despite the fact that Democrats received the majority of votes. Research shows that right-to-work laws\u2014which destroy unions\u2019 ability to donate and organize for pro-labor candidates\u2014cost Democratic candidates between two and five percent of the vote in an average election and lowers voter turnout by approximately two percent.\n\n\u201cFor Democrats to take advantage of their gains, they need to have that organizational landscape to buttress their lawmakers,\u201d said Hertel-Fernandez. Winning seats isn\u2019t enough, he argues, if Democrats can\u2019t institute policies that grow Democratic legislative power in the long term. \u201cI don\u2019t see that being built in a significant way,\u201d he added.\n\nAbsent strong public-sector unions, or sufficient long-term investment in state or local power-building from progressive funders, some left-leaning organizations have emerged to offer necessary coordination between state lawmakers, advocates, and researchers. The State Priorities Partnership (SPP) and the Economic Analysis and Research Network (EARN) both operate as state-level networks of center-left think-tanks producing research on issues like welfare reform and the minimum wage and helping coordinate between legislators in various states. The State Innovation Exchange (SiX) helps draft progressive legislation that lawmakers adapt to their local context, offering a type of support similar to what ALEC has long provided to conservatives.\n\nNovember heralded a hopeful opening to repeal harmful ALEC-backed legislation and advance a progressive local agenda. In Kansas, where Democrat Laura Kelly replaced incumbent Governor Kris Kobach (who once bragged about trying to persuade ALEC to expand its anti-voting rights campaigns), progressive legislators are working to expand education funding and Medicaid. In Colorado, where Democrats gained both the governor\u2019s mansion and the state legislature in November, the focus is on expanding local control over minimum wage laws and access to paid family leave. Such \u201cquality of life\u201d legislation is seen as essential to undoing some of the damage ALEC-backed legislation has done not just to people\u2019s lives, but to democracy as a whole. \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s been so destructive about ALEC over the years is the way they\u2019ve been able to completely undermine people\u2019s faith in government,\u201d said Naomi Walker, director of EARN. \u201cIf progressives would focus more on passing local and state policy that could really make a difference in people\u2019s lives it would help reverse some of the undoing of our social fabric that ALEC has been able to achieve.\u201d\n\nThrough knocking down the pillars of ALEC\u2019s anti-democratic agenda, advocates like Walker hope to reclaim states from conservative monopoly. Progressive policy groups are counseling legislators on how to make the redistricting process in their states more transparent ahead of 2020. Voting rights has become a rallying point for progressive groups across the country. And campaign finance reform, which would hamper ALEC\u2019s cash-flow, is gaining traction, too.\n\nBut balancing such aspirations with beating back the constant barrage of anti-democratic legislation from the right poses a challenge. In Florida, as progressive challenger Andrew Gillum threatened to overtake Governor Rick Scott in the polls, Republicans pushed for a constitutional amendment to limit property tax increases, which was approved. Voters approved a similar amendment in North Carolina, where Democrats broke the Republican supermajority on November 6. \u201cThe strategy has to be to stay a step ahead of it and spot these trends,\u201d said Nick Johnson, who directs SPP. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working to try to put a spotlight on that stuff early enough so we can block it before it takes effect.\u201d\n\nIn Virginia, where Democrats are close to flipping the state legislature next year, the power grab is already quietly underway. After a federal panel of judges last week approved new district lines in the state that strengthen potential Democrat-leaning districts, Delegate Mark Cole, a former ALEC Education Task Force member, introduced a constitutional amendment to require equal partisan representation in the state\u2019s independent redistricting commission, regardless of districts\u2019 shifting party preferences. As democratic contests across the country begin to tilt against the right wing, there seems to be no limit to its assault on the rules.\n\n*A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that David Horowitz \u201cheadlined\u201d ALEC\u2019s 2018 summit. He was merely one of the summit\u2019s speakers. We regret the error."

    "text": "At its worst, the proceduralist argument is a handy political dodge for elected officials caught between anti-war energy and the perceived risks of taking a strong position\u2014a way to avoid interrogating a particular war on its merits. Does this war enhance or endanger national security? Does this war advance or undermine the interests of average Americans? Is this war inflicting horrible misery on the civilians whose country is being bombed? There is often little oxygen left to discuss these first-order questions in a debate environment dominated by the issue of what role Congress should play.\n\nThis motivation was exemplified most recently by the bill proposed last year by Senators Tim Kaine and Bob Corker to replace the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), the law passed days after the September 11 attacks (over Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Lee\u2019s sole dissenting vote) that authorized the president to use force against \u201cthose nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided\u201d the attacks and those who \u201charbored such organizations or persons.\u201d Kaine tried to sell the bill by invoking the language of war powers proceduralism: \u201cOur proposal finally\u2026 makes Congress do its job by weighing in on where, when, and with who we are at war.\u201d Yet despite the lip service paid to an assertive Congressional role, the bill would have effectively codified Congressional acceptance of endless war: It promised to authorize military force against all of the \u201cterrorist organizations\u201d the U.S. is currently fighting, including ones like the Islamic State that did not exist on September 11. The proposal also placed no real barriers on the president if he wanted to add \u201cassociated\u201d groups to the target list, promising to expand the executive branch\u2019s wars, not limit them.\n\nCalling on Congress to assert its war powers also functions as a way for pro-war pundits to establish pseudo-opposition to unpopular wars. A few days before President Trump launched airstrikes against Syrian military targets last year, Tim Kaine tweeted, \u201cAssad should face consequences for his atrocities, but Trump is a president, not a king - he needs to come to Congress if he wants to initiate military action.\u201d This superficial posturing reaps the political benefits of opposing an unpopular president without actually opposing his wars. Would Tim Kaine vote for strikes against the Syrian government, and why or why not? Thanks to this sort of rhetorical position, his constituents never found out.\n\nIf we want to get serious about ending or even just reining in America\u2019s wars, the first step is to talk about war directly. Our domestic policy procedures shouldn\u2019t be mythologized as a guarantee of good foreign policy. Anti-war advocates who use the proceduralist appeal must understand that calling on Congress to \u201creclaim\u201d its war powers is by no means inherently an anti-war argument, as countless pro-war proceduralists have made clear. Ultimately, while law can set the procedures for doing politics, it cannot be a substitute for politics: In an era of perpetual war, the only way to get members of Congress to vote for peace is to convince them, and their constituents, that endless war must end."

    "text": "Though Farhadi has been planning a version of this project for several years, its appearance now feels like a bid for a larger audience, featuring two Hollywood stars and a classic form of woman-in-peril suspense. Originally trained in theater, Farhadi has directed eight films, all but two made and set in Iran. Since the release of his masterpiece, A Separation , in 2011, he has achieved a rare and enviable stature internationally, garnering widespread critical acclaim and twice winning the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. He is very much an auteur, writing most of his scripts alone, haunting the editing room, and frequently involving himself in tiny aspects of sound and set design\u2014the smallest details bear his imprint, and certain motifs recur from film to film. Several of his previous works involve a possible crime and a shifting sense of who might be responsible, but in Everybody Knows, the underlying social tensions and the hapless mistakes and accidents that send everything unraveling are grafted on to a more familiar thriller plot.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that in both the films Farhadi has set outside Iran, the central pair are exes. Both The Past, set on the outskirts of Paris and filmed in French, and this one, made in Spanish, replace the complexities of a marriage with those of a former love, its resentments and secrets, and the grip of what\u2019s gone. It\u2019s as if the ordinary experiences of comfortable, urban European couples don\u2019t yield quite the same drama as those of their Iranian counterparts\u2014in these European stories, a particular set of built-in losses, conflicts, and disappointments is required to get things going.\n\nBoth these European films lack several layers of detail, which you only miss if you\u2019ve seen Farhadi\u2019s other work. The texture of everyday life is less precise\u2014the peripheral fruit pickers and wedding guests in Everybody Knows don\u2019t refract the central concerns of the story in the subtle way that, in earlier films, the crowds of people in banks or waiting for pretrial interrogations in Tehran do. The tensions created by class and religion enrich the story and inform every line and glance in A Separation, in which upper-middle-class Nader shoves Razieh, the woman he has hired to care for his father; she\u2019s pregnant, and loses her baby that day. What follows is a mixture of contingency and fate; people\u2019s pride, defensiveness, and fear are the same everywhere, and yet events play out differently from the way they would in any other place. Everyone involved is aware of the others\u2019 automatic suspicions about them\u2014Nader and his wife know they\u2019ll be perceived as unprincipled, godless, irresponsible; Razieh\u2019s unemployed husband, Hodjat, knows the other couple will see him as an inarticulate, aggressive creature.\n\nIn the Spanish story, by contrast, religion has no real political or social dimension, and class, rather than inflecting everything, looms in the foreground, giving the characters a fairly straightforward set of motives. Suspicion falls on the fruit pickers Paco\u2019s wife employs and invited to the wedding. Laura\u2019s relatives resent Paco and his vineyard\u2019s success\u2014he bought the land cheaply from Laura years ago\u2014and Paco\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t trust Alejandro, the once-rich husband now in need of money. Whereas Nader and others of his class in A Separation only hint delicately that they look down on men like Hodjat (it\u2019s a sign of Hodjat\u2019s station that he\u2019s a little more explicit about such things, complaining that the interrogator hearing their case won\u2019t give him fair treatment because \u201cI can\u2019t talk like this guy\u201d), here Laura\u2019s family tells Paco straight out that they still see him as \u201cthe servant\u2019s son.\u201d\n\nLikewise, The Past, though it alludes to the problems foreigners may face within France, doesn\u2019t ground the families\u2019 universal conflicts in the local context quite as elegantly as Farhadi\u2019s Iranian films do. His scripts are usually novelistic in their intricacy of reference and their structure. Each tiny moving piece is interrelated. In Everybody Knows, the necessity of making things explicit means some deeper resonance is lost."

    "text": "More telling was a remark from Kellyanne Conway, one of Trump\u2019s top advisers. \u201cThis president is going to call for an end to the politics of resistance, retribution and call for more comity,\u201d she told the Post. Trump often describes special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s inquiry as a political vendetta by Democrats for losing the last presidential election, but in Tuesday\u2019s speech, he even suggested that the Russia investigation oversight of his presidency could imperil the nation\u2019s recovery from the Great Recession: \u201cAn economic miracle is taking place in the United States, and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous, partisan investigations.\u201d\n\nTrump did highlight some genuine bipartisan accomplishments, such as last year\u2019s passage of criminal justice reform. Among his invited guests were Matthew Charles, who was released from prison under the law\u2019s new conditions last month, as well as Alice Johnson, who received a pardon from Trump last year after serving 22 years behind bars. It\u2019s possible that Trump may be willing to sign similar legislation in the future. Those accomplishments, however, will be the exception rather than the rule when it comes to Trump\u2019s relationship with Congress.\n\nIt\u2019s traditional for presidents to propose moonshots in addressing a joint Congress, as John F. Kennedy did in 1962 in calling on America to put a man on the Moon, but they have a spotty track record at best. Barack Obama called for 80 percent of Americans to have high-speed rail access in 25 years and used his final address to put Vice President Joe Biden in charge of a project to cure cancer. Trump\u2019s moonshot on Tuesday night was to call for the eradication of HIV transmission in the U.S. by 2030\u2014a laudable goal, but a somewhat fantastical one given it would require him to work with communities upon which his other policies have inflicted the most damage.\n\nSome observers noted that ahead of Trump\u2019s latest State of the Union that the address can help reset a president\u2019s agenda. The most famous turnaround came in 1998, when Bill Clinton focused on Social Security and the budget surplus the day after telling the nation that he hadn\u2019t had sexual relations with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. \u201cBy dint of his speaking skills and his personality, he was able to go in and change the tone of the debate,\u201d University of Virginia professor Russell Riley told NPR on Monday. \u201cThere were a lot of people within the Clinton White House that felt that that saved his presidency.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s virtually no chance that Trump can pull off a similar turnaround. Clinton, for all his flaws, was one of the most persuasive speakers to serve in the Oval Office. He enjoyed high approval ratings even throughout the Lewinsky scandal; they went up to 72 percent on the week he was impeached by the House of Representatives for perjury and obstruction of justice. Trump, on the other hand, can only effectively communicate with his own base. His approval ratings sunk to new lows after the American people blamed him for the damage wrought by last month\u2019s partial government shutdown.\n\nA president\u2019s success depends on his ability to building working relationships with lawmakers and his own advisers. But Trump\u2019s tenure has largely been dictated by his own fleeting whims, which have undercut his party\u2019s leaders in Congress and his closest confidantes. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell secured a deal to keep the government open last November, only to see it fall apart when figures like Ann Coulter pressured Trump into a self-defeating showdown. There\u2019s little rationale for Republicans, let alone Democrats, to trust his word.\n\n\n\nThe weaknesses in Trump\u2019s presidency are structural. Look no further than the recent leak of his private schedule to Axios earlier this week, which underscored the two great themes of his presidency. It\u2019s often said that a person\u2019s most valuable commodity is his own time, and Trump appears to largely waste his by watching cable news and calling old friends and supporters for advice: At least 60 percent of his daily routine over the last three months has been dedicated to unstructured \u201cExecutive Time.\u201d What\u2019s more, the leak itself amounted to an extraordinary breach of trust by one of the president\u2019s closest aides. It underscores how his personal flaws have driven away talented subordinates and attracted self-serving replacements.\n\nTrump ended Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union much as he began it. \u201cWe must choose whether we are defined by our differences\u2014or whether we dare to transcend them,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots. This is our future\u2014our fate\u2014and our choice to make. I am asking you to choose greatness. No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.\u201d\n\nThis call for bipartisanship may sound reassuring to casual observers. But remember Trump\u2019s \u201crapists\u201d speech in announcing his candidacy in 2015. Remember \u201cAmerican carnage.\u201d Remember last year\u2019s State of the Union. Remember everything Trump has done since then. Trump says that Americans have a choice to make, and that much is true: They will make it in 2020. But Trump made his own choice long ago. Greatness never had a chance."

    "text": "Reason rarely defeats emotion\u2014or, as Catherine Fieschi, an expert on political extremism, told me, gut instinct. If it did, right-wing populist movements from Brexit to Bolsonaro would be on the retreat, not in the advance. Those caught in the web of Trumpism do not see the deception that surrounds them. And if scandals too numerous to list have not dented faith in Trump, those holding out for an apocalyptic moment of reckoning that suddenly drops the curtain\u2014the Russia investigation, or his taxes\u2014will only be disappointed. In all likelihood, the idea that Trump is a crook has been \u201cpriced in.\u201d\n\nWhen presented with his actual record, which has often fallen short of what he promised on the campaign trail, Trump supporters time and again have displayed either disbelief or indifference. As a Trump supporter explicitly stated in reference to the president\u2019s many, many lies, \u201cI don\u2019t care if he sprouts a third dick up there.\u201d What actually is doesn\u2019t matter; what does is that Trump reflects back to his supporters a general feeling of what ought to be, a general truthiness in their guts.\n\nThose caught in the web of Trumpism do not see the deception that surrounds them.\n\nAmidst the frenetic pace of disgrace and outrage, Trump\u2019s support remains stable among too large a chunk of the American public to just ignore. Trump, who insisted on the presence of voter fraud by the millions in an election he ultimately won, and a coterie of prominent Republicans spent the week after the 2018 midterms delegitimizing the very notion of counting all the votes in key races in Florida, Georgia, and Arizona. Trump\u2019s claim that he could shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue and still retain the loyalty of his followers is jokingly referred to as the truest thing he\u2019s ever said, but it\u2019s less funny that 52 percent of them would hypothetically support postponing the 2020 election if he proposed it. What happens when a man who has already promoted political violence, and whose most hardcore supporters have shown their willingness for such violence, finds on election night two years from now that he has just narrowly lost? Do any of us truly believe that Donald J. Trump and his followers will simply slink away quietly into the night?\n\nSo, how do we get those caught up in the cult of Trump to leave it?\n\n\n\nDaryl Davis has played the blues for over 30 years, including with the likes of Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis. He\u2019s also spent 30 years talking to Klansmen, over 200 of whom have quit the KKK as a result of their conversations, handing over their robes to Davis\u2014who is black. \u201cWhen two enemies are talking, they\u2019re not fighting,\u201d Davis told NPR in 2017. \u201cI didn\u2019t convert anybody,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey saw the light and converted themselves.\u201d\n\nDavis\u2019s success is more than a cute, feel-good story. It involved the real-world application of techniques that scholars advocate employing to help individuals leave cults. A 2011 study by the RAND Corporation concluded that, \u201cFactors associated with leaving street gangs, religious cults, right-wing extremist groups, and organized crime groups\u201d included positive social ties and an organic disillusionment with the group\u2019s beliefs or ideology. As psychologists Rod and Linda Dubrow-Marshall write in The Conversation, it\u2019s extremely difficult for people to admit they are wrong, and it\u2019s crucial for them to arrive at that realization on their own.\n\nThe debate over how to deal with Trump\u2019s anti-democratic following has largely avoided the question of engaging it directly. These days there is no shortage of articles and books dealing with radical-right populism, despots, democratic backsliding, and the tactics that authoritarian leaders deploy. Dozens of experts have pointed out that liberal democratic institutions need constant attention and reinforcement in order to be effective bulwarks. But most of the solutions on offer are institutional in nature: maintaining the independence of the judiciary, thwarting a would-be autocrat\u2019s attempts to grab hold of the levers of justice, maintaining a legislative check on executive authority, enshrining political norms more clearly into constitutions.\n\nIn their 2011 book, Defeating Authoritarian Leaders in Post-Communist Countries, Valerie Bunce and Sharon Wolchik conclude that democratization in Eastern European nations like Croatia owed much to assistance from transnational pro-democracy networks, civil society, and energetic election campaigns run by a united opposition. In some ways this analysis offers us a modicum of hope: Trump, despite his desires, commands far less power over the political system than did any of the autocrats that Bunce and Wolchik studied, and the United States enjoys many of the elements they cite as critical, like robust civil society, energetic elections, and a mostly unified opposition. But at the same time, the very things responsible for the success of democratic transition are under near constant assault from Trump and his Republican abettors.\n\nThe very things responsible for the success of democratic transition are under near constant assault from Trump and his Republican abettors.\n\nDemocracy, especially liberal democracy, has always been dependent on the trust and belief of the self-governed. It is one thing to implement tangible measures to prevent the decay of bedrock institutions, and when it comes to voting rights, elections, the courts, and restraints on executive power, we know what these measures should look like. It\u2019s another, far tougher thing to figure out how to maintain the legitimacy of these same institutions\u2014and how to restore it once lost.\n\nJavier Corrales, a political science professor at Amherst College and expert on the Chavez regime, has written that one lesson from Venezuela\u2019s experience is for the opposition to avoid fragmentation within the broader electorate and, when possible, polarization. When it comes to Trump, he told me that rather than pursuing impeachment, which could backfire by polarizing institutions and the general environment even more, \u201cthe opposition needs to focus on strengthening institutions of checks and balances, and embracing and defending policies that produce majoritarian consensus rather than just cater to the base. The more defections they can get from voters that would otherwise side with the illiberal president, the better. If the opposition can get the other side to split, they win.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to helping individuals leave cult-like groups, many sociologists agree: Positive social factors are more effective than negative sanctions. Lalich counsels using dialogue to ask questions and reinforce doubts, rather than \u201cto harp\u201d or criticize. Testimonials from former cult members can be particularly helpful in fueling disillusionment, she says.\n\nOn a nationwide scale, this would probably look a lot like a field called \u201cconflict transformation.\u201d John Paul Lederach, professor emeritus at Notre Dame\u2019s Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, laid out the basics of conflict transformation in his 1998 book, Building Peace: Sustainable Reconciliation in Divided Societies. He argued that outsiders should work with mid-level members of the community who could simultaneously engage ordinary people and their leaders. He also called for an \u201celicitive approach\u201d whereby solutions were developed by people themselves, in accordance with their own specific cultural contexts.\n\nOf the places in the world where conflict transformation has worked, Northern Ireland probably most approximates the United States, in the sense that it was part of a wealthy nation with a democratic tradition (though in the 1980s, Northern Ireland was in a far worse situation of political division and communitarian violence).\n\nMaria Power, a researcher in conflict transformation studies at Oxford, sees strategies from Northern Ireland that could be deployed on the other side of the Atlantic. She cited the example of dialogue-building between Unionist and Republican women, who faced much tougher obstacles to reconciliation since they were \u201crisking their lives\u201d every time they met in East Belfast during The Troubles. She said that the peace effort in Northern Ireland hinged on incredibly tough, person-to-person groundwork carried out by dozens of organizations and ecumenical groups. She emphasized above all the importance of investing effort and time into building trust, first within, and then later between, identity groups.\n\nPower said that conflict transformation in the United States would likely involve local, grassroots community development in the areas that Trump likes to hold rallies. \u201cI don\u2019t mean that progressives should go to these communities and start knocking on doors,\u201d she explained, \u201cthat would be the worst thing that could happen to exacerbate tensions. I mean that there should be a focus on real community development in these areas.\u201d\n\nIndividuals would be led through a \u201csingle identity dialogue,\u201d a safe-space where someone who has gained the community\u2019s trust can guide them through discussion of their identity, why they feel threatened, and why they feel the need to otherize those they see as different. This does presume some legitimacy to their fears; as The Atlantic\u2019s Adam Serwer, among others, has written convincingly, Trumpism is not primarily a story of globalism\u2019s dispossessed, but rather one of identity politics. But there is reality, and there is perception, and the truth is that Trump voters perceive themselves as victims who have been culturally dislocated, disdained, and in danger of being left behind.\n\nPower said that, in the mid-1980s, Northern Ireland had some 300 of these single-identity groups. She added that there was a tough balance to strike between allowing people \u201cto become comfortable enough with their own place in society that other people don\u2019t seem to be a threat,\u201d and \u201cdripping\u201d in truth in such a way that avoided a reinforcement of their existing beliefs.\n\nOnly once that step had been undertaken on a local level were people able to have cross-community conversation, and eventually to engage with each other through social action projects\u2014schemes to bring people together, not over political discussion, but in tasks beneficial to their communities. Power lamented that overall this is quite a long-term process, perhaps even a generational one.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Emma Elfversson, who researches peace and conflict at Sweden\u2019s Uppsala University. Elfversson told me that because trust in the state and institutions is often crucial to reconciliation, democratic backsliding in the U.S. is worrying. \u201cImportant work to overcome divides is done at the grassroots level\u2014through NGOs, religious initiatives, social service programs, schools, at the workplace, etc.,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cCivil society organizations that cut across identity borders can promote reconciliation and reduce conflict.\u201d\n\nThe problem for the modern left is that none of this is emotionally satisfying. It\u2019s just hard, hard work.\n\nSuch an approach might seem fuzzy to those who seek to buttress qualitative observations with hard data, but there are concrete examples of places where community-based peace building has been effective. Fieschi thinks that the way to short-circuit populism is to create an environment where people can think. \u201cPopulism encourages every fiber of your being not to think,\u201d she told me. \u201cIn fact, it pretty much posits that if you have to think you\u2019re not to be trusted. We need to create those spaces and times that offer the opportunity to exercise agency, to think things through.\u201d\n\nThe problem for the modern left is that none of this is emotionally satisfying. It\u2019s just hard, hard work. Push too hard, and you risk fostering even greater resentment and reaction. But let people off the hook, and the myths they perpetuate about race and national identity might never get punctured.\n\nAbove all, it also rings as profoundly unfair. Why should a group that still enjoys the momentum of historic privilege, and is still afforded outsize political weight, be handheld through an era of demographic change? And why should minority groups, who continue to suffer from oppression, be the ones to extend that hand?\n\nAmerican politics, as Alexis de Tocqueville once observed, has often had a religious character to it, with the nation itself exalted in a messianic way. After the end of the Vietnam War, Thomas Robbins and Dick Anthony, two researchers of cults, wrote, \u201cThere is a recurrent sequence in American history in which sectarian (and sometimes rather authoritarian) religions emerge and elicit tremendous hostility.\u201d The decline of Cold War orthodoxy after Vietnam, the two noted, had produced a crisis in American civil religion, resulting in \u201cthe proliferation of cults as well as the growth of anticult demonology.\u201d\n\nWe can understand Donald Trump\u2019s rise as a civil religion giving way to its cultic expression. Con man, cult leader, populist politician: Trump is all of these, rolled into one. He has become all-encompassing, even to nonbelievers. We all feel the fatigue of merely existing in the Trump era, the rapid-fire assault on all of our political and social senses. We want immediate solutions to the Trump problem. We want to beat reason into his followers, until they recognize how wrong they are, or at the very least, submit. We want to blame them\u2014justifiably\u2014for perpetuating his sham.\n\nI want these things. I want them in my gut. But I also know that the cult\u2019s pull is so powerful that it risks destroying its opponents, by eliciting a counterproductive reaction to it. If we want to bring members of the Trump cult back into the mainstream of American life\u2014and there will be plenty of those who say we should move on without them\u2014resistance means not only resisting the lure of the cult and exposing its lies, but also resisting the temptation to punish its followers.\n\n\u201cWhen the cultic behavior is on a national scale, [breaking it up] is going to take a national movement,\u201d Lalich says. Such an approach promises no immediate gratification. But it also might be the only way to move forward, rather than continue a dangerous downward spiral. Andr\u00e9s Miguel Rond\u00f3n, a Venezuelan economist who fled to Spain, wrote this of his own country\u2019s experience of being caught up in an authoritarian\u2019s fraudulent promises: \u201c[W]hat can really win them over is not to prove that you are right. It is to show that you care. Only then will they believe what you say.\u201d"

    "text": "More telling was a remark from Kellyanne Conway, one of Trump\u2019s top advisers. \u201cThis president is going to call for an end to the politics of resistance, retribution and call for more comity,\u201d she told the Post. Trump often describes special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s inquiry as a political vendetta by Democrats for losing the last presidential election, but in Tuesday\u2019s speech, he even suggested that the Russia investigation oversight of his presidency could imperil the nation\u2019s recovery from the Great Recession: \u201cAn economic miracle is taking place in the United States, and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous, partisan investigations.\u201d\n\nTrump did highlight some genuine bipartisan accomplishments, such as last year\u2019s passage of criminal justice reform. Among his invited guests were Matthew Charles, who was released from prison under the law\u2019s new conditions last month, as well as Alice Johnson, who received a pardon from Trump last year after serving 22 years behind bars. It\u2019s possible that Trump may be willing to sign similar legislation in the future. Those accomplishments, however, will be the exception rather than the rule when it comes to Trump\u2019s relationship with Congress.\n\nIt\u2019s traditional for presidents to propose moonshots in addressing a joint Congress, as John F. Kennedy did in 1962 in calling on America to put a man on the Moon, but they have a spotty track record at best. Barack Obama called for 80 percent of Americans to have high-speed rail access in 25 years and used his final address to put Vice President Joe Biden in charge of a project to cure cancer. Trump\u2019s moonshot on Tuesday night was to call for the eradication of HIV transmission in the U.S. by 2030\u2014a laudable goal, but a somewhat fantastical one given it would require him to work with communities upon which his other policies have inflicted the most damage.\n\nSome observers noted that ahead of Trump\u2019s latest State of the Union that the address can help reset a president\u2019s agenda. The most famous turnaround came in 1998, when Bill Clinton focused on Social Security and the budget surplus the day after telling the nation that he hadn\u2019t had sexual relations with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. \u201cBy dint of his speaking skills and his personality, he was able to go in and change the tone of the debate,\u201d University of Virginia professor Russell Riley told NPR on Monday. \u201cThere were a lot of people within the Clinton White House that felt that that saved his presidency.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s virtually no chance that Trump can pull off a similar turnaround. Clinton, for all his flaws, was one of the most persuasive speakers to serve in the Oval Office. He enjoyed high approval ratings even throughout the Lewinsky scandal; they went up to 72 percent on the week he was impeached by the House of Representatives for perjury and obstruction of justice. Trump, on the other hand, can only effectively communicate with his own base. His approval ratings sunk to new lows after the American people blamed him for the damage wrought by last month\u2019s partial government shutdown.\n\nA president\u2019s success depends on his ability to building working relationships with lawmakers and his own advisers. But Trump\u2019s tenure has largely been dictated by his own fleeting whims, which have undercut his party\u2019s leaders in Congress and his closest confidantes. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell secured a deal to keep the government open last November, only to see it fall apart when figures like Ann Coulter pressured Trump into a self-defeating showdown. There\u2019s little rationale for Republicans, let alone Democrats, to trust his word.\n\n\n\nThe weaknesses in Trump\u2019s presidency are structural. Look no further than the recent leak of his private schedule to Axios earlier this week, which underscored the two great themes of his presidency. It\u2019s often said that a person\u2019s most valuable commodity is his own time, and Trump appears to largely waste his by watching cable news and calling old friends and supporters for advice: At least 60 percent of his daily routine over the last three months has been dedicated to unstructured \u201cExecutive Time.\u201d What\u2019s more, the leak itself amounted to an extraordinary breach of trust by one of the president\u2019s closest aides.

      "Emily Atkin"
    ],
    "text": "The majority of parents who reject these requirements today, however, aren\u2019t from vulnerable groups. They\u2019re opting out for their own religious or personal beliefs. Parents aren\u2019t legally allowed to do that in every state, but can in the two states experiencing major measles outbreaks. Religious exemptions are permitted in New York, where the outbreak is primarily affecting the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community. Both personal and religious exemptions are allowed in Washington, which according to one infectious disease researcher has become \u201ca major anti-vaccine hot spot due to non-medical vaccine exemptions that have nothing to do with religion.\u201d\n\nimmune.org\n\nRoutine childhood vaccination programs have been shown to prevent approximately 42,000 early deaths and 20 million cases of disease per year, saving $13.5 billion in direct costs. That\u2019s why non-medical exemption laws are opposed by the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Infectious Diseases Society of America\u2014basically every reputable medical organization out there. But nearly every state has them in some form. There is also \u201ctremendous variability in the rigor with which such beliefs must be proved or documented,\u201d according to the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS). In some states, \u201cparents simply need to state that \u2018their religion\u2019 is against vaccination to be granted an exemption, even though no major religions specifically discourage vaccination.\u201d\n\nThese problems are being compounded by the growth of the anti-vaccine movement, which argues that vaccines are more dangerous than the government and medical community claim, and thus no vaccines should be mandatory. Neither their facts nor their logic holds up. \u201cParents cannot be exempted from placing infants in car seats simply because they do not \u2018believe\u2019 in them,\u201d argues PIDS. States also don\u2019t allow belief exemptions for laws intended to protect other people, like driving a car without a license. \u201cWhether or not children should be vaccinated before childcare or school entry ought not be a matter of \u2018belief,\u2019\u201d the group argues. \u201cRather, it should be a matter of public policy based on the best available scientific evidence, and in this case the science is definitive: vaccines are safe and they save lives.\u201d\n\nSo why doesn\u2019t Congress just pass a vaccination law outlawing non-medical exemptions? \u201cWe would love it if they could do something at the federal level,\u201d said Rich Greenaway, the director of operations for the advocacy group Vaccinate Your Family. \u201cWe\u2019d be 100 percent behind it.\u201d But it\u2019s not clear that Congress has that legal authority. According to the Congressional Research Service, \u201cthe preservation of the public health has been the primary responsibility of state and local governments, and the authority to enact laws relevant to the protection of the public health derives from the state\u2019s general police powers.\u201d Creating a federal vaccination law would turn that historical precedent on its head.\n\nA federal vaccination law would also set the stage for a fierce legal battle with vaccine opponents that would almost certainly make its way to the Supreme Court. The risk of losing that battle, while providing a major platform for anti-vaxxers, might not be worth it. Besides, the state\u2019s authority to set vaccination requirements was already confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court over 100 years ago, and federal lawmakers also don\u2019t have much interest in taking that authority away, Greenaway said. \u201cThe legislators at the federal level, they kind of know that their states want to handle this and they step back from it.\u201d"

    "text": "The show\u2019s chief flaw lies in its sympathetic portrayal of law enforcement. Various cops describe Bundy as preternaturally intelligent, evading them at every step. In fact, he simply started out murdering women in different jurisdictions, then crossed state lines to do the same thing again. It\u2019s true that the police at this time had no easy way to cross-reference evidence from different cop shops, but there are multiple points in the Bundy story where sheer idiocy prevented his capture.\n\nAfter he murdered 21-year-old Lynda Healy in Washington, for example, investigators initially assumed that the blood in her bed was either from a nosebleed or menstruation. In his book The Riverman: Ted Bundy and The Hunt for the Green River Killer, King County detective Robert Keppel wrote of the first investigators that \u201c[b]ecause they assumed Lynda Healy was possibly having her period at the time of her disappearance, they couldn\u2019t figure out why anyone would kidnap her\u2014they assumed no kidnapper would want to have sex with her.\u201d\n\nNone of this makes it into the show. The focus is instead on Bundy himself. Netflix, to a distasteful degree, plays up the ghoulish fascination he exerts over us. In its press materials, the streaming service says he \u201cinvades our psyche in a fresh yet terrifying way.\u201d The idea is that it\u2019s really \u201cour psyche\u201d on display here. The ultimate question Bundy asks the audience is this: Would you have known?\n\n\n\nSomething about his persona is extremely disconcerting to white, middle-class Americans. His superficial charm and medium good looks were all the cover that he needed; simple disbelief prevented his identification for far too long. The \u201ccareer\u201d of Ted Bundy, which claimed 30 lives or more, is therefore a direct indictment of American society. It turns out that the kind of face we find attractive is also the kind of face that can disguise. What does that say about male beauty in the 1970s and beyond? Well, it says that we are most attracted to the average, to the indistinct, the kind of face that could belong to anybody.\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of Bundy\u2019s legion of female admirers, who showed up to support him during his trial. His fans professed a simple attraction to his face and comportment, but there\u2019s no doubt that his misogynist violence fascinated a certain sector of women. Perhaps it\u2019s the idea that women exerted a mythical, archetypal power over him. If he was powerless to resist the urge to bite Lisa Levy\u2019s nipple almost clean off, then, the thinking goes, Lisa Levy must have really meant something to him. It\u2019s a strange logic, but it works perfectly inside the matrix of gendered power, in which women are supposed to be empowered by passivity, ruling the domestic sphere like goddesses. It\u2019s no coincidence that Bundy liked to invade homes and murder women in their beds.\n\n"

He soon reverts to his grievances against \u201cinaccurate reporting.\u201d\n\nTrump later defends himself by insisting he\u2019s not alone in his critique of the Times. \u201cI know what you\u2019re all saying,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut everybody thinks The New York Times treats me terribly. Washington Post also.\u201d When the meeting wraps up, Trump tries to end on an upbeat and unbelievable note. \u201cI mean, you know, anyway I agree with you 100 percent, and I\u2019m honored to have spent the time with you, and I\u2019d like you to call me, and I\u2019m going to work on that so hard you have no idea,\u201d he told the Times\u2019 team. \u201cCause I think you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019d be nice to think that the president meant that. But past experience suggests otherwise. Delegitimizing media outlets is too valuable a tactic for him to give up so easily. In a tweet last May, Trump effectively admitted that he uses \u201cfake news\u201d as a general term to describe negative coverage of his administration. It works, too: A poll earlier that spring found that 89 percent of Republicans think major news outlets spread fake news. Trump\u2019s slim road to reelection depends on holding together his base, which means he needs to inoculate as many of them as possible from the whirlwind of bad news that surrounds him.\n\nEven if the president gained no strategic advantage from his attacks on the press, there\u2019s no reason to believe he\u2019d ever relent. This has nothing to do with his prodigious talent for lying and fabulism. It\u2019s that he is often unable to stick to any particular stance, especially when pressed on it in person. Even his own party struggles with his mercurial nature. Last January, they scrambled to remind Trump that he opposed a clean DACA vote after California Senator Dianne Feinstein pressed him to support it on national television. Pressure from conservative commentators over border wall funding last December led Trump to renege on congressional Republicans and force a self-destructive government shutdown."

    "text": "More also needs to be done to improve conditions for current prisoners. A group of Democratic senators introduced the Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act in July 2017, which focused on the unique challenges facing women behind bars. The First Step Act includes some of its provisions. It will formally ban federal prison officials from shackling pregnant women before, during, and shortly after they give birth, which can pose health risks. It also requires the Bureau of Prisons to consider placing incarcerated parents near their children.\n\nBut other parts from the 2017 bill are worth implementing, such as banning federal prisons from charging prisoners for their phone calls and requiring the Bureau of Prisons to implement video conferencing technology free of charge. Both measures would try to rein in companies that charge exorbitant rates for prisoners to stay in touch with the outside world. The Federal Communications Commission tried to cap prison phone rates under existing laws in 2015, but telecom companies successfully persuaded a federal appeals court to strike down the restrictions last year.\n\nMost of the First Step Act focuses on sentencing and incarceration. Other aspects of the criminal justice system are in dire need of reform, too. In 2015, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott drafted the Walter Scott Notification Act in response to increased public scrutiny of police shootings. The bill would require state and local police departments that receive federal funds to submit yearly reports to the federal government about police shootings by their officers, the race and gender breakdown of those shot, and other valuable data points.\n\nThe senator named the bill after Walter Scott, to whom he is not related, after North Carolina police officer Michael Slager shot and killed Scott during a daytime encounter in 2015. Footage of the officer shooting him in the back drew national condemnation; Slager received a 20-year sentence after he pleaded guilty to federal civil-rights charges. Senator Scott\u2019s bill would shine a light on one of the great statistical voids in modern American law enforcement. The closest thing to a national database on police shootings is currently maintained by The Washington Post. Scott tried without success to include his bill in the First Step Act; it\u2019s worth trying again.\n\n\n\nAnd if federal lawmakers want to truly reduce unnecessarily harsh sentences and tackle excessive incarceration, they could reverse one of the major tough-on-crime policies of their predecessors. Most states use parole to alleviate high prison populations and to help people convicted of crimes transition back into normal life more quickly. The federal government, however, abandoned the practice in the early 1980s. The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 abolished the federal parole system for future inmates. The practical result is that there are few mechanisms to release federal prisoners who pose no danger to society or risk of re-offending."

    "text": "But the mere presence of lobbyists in Trump\u2019s cabinet doesn\u2019t raise the alarm of government ethics experts. \u201cThe revolving door is a basic part of the Washington Establishment,\u201d said Laura Peterson, an investigator at the Project on Government Oversight. \u201cPeople go back and forth between the public and private sectors all the time.\u201d It makes sense why they would; government agencies regularly deal with lobbyists when they\u2019re crafting regulations, so they hire people who are familiar with the process.\n\nThe Trump administration does, however, seem \u201cparticularly comfortable stacking high-level posts with former lobbyists whose policy proposals are like a corporate Christmas list,\u201d said Peterson. As ProPublica revealed in March, \u201cAt least 187 Trump political appointees have been federal lobbyists, and despite President Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to \u2018drain the swamp,\u2019 many are now overseeing the industries they once lobbied on behalf of.\u201d\n\nThese former lobbyists are not only flooding the government. They\u2019re entering \u201ca wild west environment where anything goes,\u201d said Walter Shaub, the former head of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics from 2013 to 2017, when he resigned out of \u201cdisappointment\u201d with Trump.\n\n\n\nShaub emphasized that previous administrations had \u201ca lot\u201d of industry members. \u201cBut past Republican presidents were similar to Democratic presidents in at least supporting the government ethics programs,\u201d he said. President Barack Obama, for example, signed an executive order in 2009 prohibiting the government from hiring people who had been a lobbyist in the previous year. Special waivers could be granted, but had to be made public. A hired former lobbyist would also be prohibited from working on any issue on which they had previously lobbied.\n\nTrump repealed Obama\u2019s policy when he took office, replacing it with an executive order that he claimed would more effectively \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d But the ethics order has proven much weaker than Obama\u2019s in practice, Shaub said. Now, lobbyists can be hired for any government position. Lobbyists can also work on issues where they have a direct conflict of interest, provided they get a waiver. And Trump has been giving these waivers out like candy to the most powerful people in his administration\u2014at least 37 \u201cto key administration officials at the White House and executive branch agencies,\u201d according to a March report from the Associated Press."

    "text": "Only part of the controversy surrounding Northam stems from the revelations themselves. Northam first issued a statement on Friday night admitting that he was one of the two men in the photo, though he did not specify which one. \u201cThis behavior is not in keeping with who I am today and the values I have fought for throughout my career in the military, in medicine, and in public service,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut I want to be clear, I understand how this decision shakes Virginians\u2019 faith in that commitment.\u201d Northam also implicitly ruled out the possibility that he would step down. \u201cI recognize that it will take time and serious effort to heal the damage this conduct has caused,\u201d he added. \u201cI am ready to do that important work.\u201d\n\nHis response seriously misjudged the mood within Democratic circles, which saw his departure as the only feasible way to heal that damage. Northam then tried to remedy the situation with a press conference on Saturday that ultimately proved his critics right. He retracted his admission that he was in the yearbook photo, telling reporters that he had mixed it up with a time he had actually worn blackface in 1984 to portray Michael Jackson in a look-a-like contest. His explanation for the error\u2014that he was simply eager to \u201creach out and apologize\u201d for whatever had happened\u2014smacked of political expediency instead of a genuine reckoning with his past actions.\n\nIndeed, Northam seemed fundamentally unable to grasp the gravity of the scandal. When a reporter asked if he could still moonwalk like Jackson, Northam looked around as if to find space to prove he could. Only a pointed reminder from his wife\u2014\u201cinappropriate circumstances,\u201d she told him\u2014brought the governor back to reality. \u201cIn light of his public admission and apology for his decision to appear in the photo, he has irrevocably lost the faith and trust of the people he was elected to serve,\u201d the Virginia Black Legislative Caucus said in a statement as the press conference unfolded. \u201cChanging his public story today now casts further doubt on his ability to regain that trust.\u201d\n\nFor all his professed confusion about what took place, Northam seems clear-eyed about the power dynamics at play here. He cannot be forced from office over this scandal: The state constitution only allows impeachment if the governor commits \u201cmalfeasance in office, corruption, neglect of duty, or other high crime or misdemeanor,\u201d none of which has happened here. Virginia\u2019s governors are also limited to a single four-year term in office, so he does not need to appeal to the electorate to win reelection. Northam is, in practical terms, accountable to nothing for the next three years except his conscience.\n\nIdeally, his conscience would be more than enough. Nobody expects a government of saints, of course. That\u2019s why governors and legislators have fixed terms in office and regular opportunities to vote for their replacements. Anti-corruption laws and the power of impeachment even allow for removals from office without elections for the most egregious breaches of the public trust. Before all of that, however, is the underlying premise of public service: that elected officials will act in the public\u2019s best interests and not necessarily their own. Northam\u2019s refusal to step down subordinates those interests to his own political survival."

    "text": "Positive coverage kept Vucic from appearing weak or subservient to the EU\u2014a liability in Serbian politics. Anytime a significant compromise was made in the ongoing political dialogue with Kosovo, or a particularly painful reform needed to be instituted as part of Serbia\u2019s EU accession process, tabloids featured stories about how Vucic had stood up to the representatives of Kosovo\u2019s Albanian majority, trying to contort it into a victory. Those pointing out deficiencies in this logic\u2014critical outlets like the daily Danas, weeklies Vreme and NIN, as well TV channels like N1\u2014would either be shouted down by Vucic personally during press conferences, or be torn apart for days by tabloids and on social media.\n\nIn the past few months, however, press intimidation and government-friendly media consolidation has escalated. On November 23, leftist politician Borko Stefanovic was viciously attacked by men dressed in black. The event launched weeks of protests in Belgrade that quickly outgrew their initial impetus, tens of thousands of disgruntled citizens joining in a general expression of discontent. As the protests grew, so did the pressure on the media.\n\nIvan Ivanovic, one of Serbia\u2019s most well-known TV personalities and until recently the host of a popular weekly talk show on the Prva channel, was one of the first to be targeted. After tweeting his criticism of a Vucic-loyal outlet for questionable coverage both dismissing and demonizing the protesters, Ivanovic found himself the center of attention.\n\n\u201cMy wife was awoken by our cat, who wanted to get outside, and she heard the shattering of glass against our garage and saw that it had been set on fire.\u201d\n\nAt a press conference days later, Vucic denounced Ivanovic\u2019s tweet, falsely claiming it had called for violence against the journalist in question. \u201cI was shocked,\u201d Ivanovic told me. The following day, tabloids published numerous stories saying Ivanovic was a foreign agent and traitor.\n\nSimultaneously, Ivanovic\u2019s outlet was being taken over. The Prva television network, with national reach, had made Ivanovic one of the few individuals in Serbia with continuous access to homes across the country. Channels like N1, considered to be one of the most independent, are only available on cable and reach significantly fewer viewers. Around the time of the first protest, news broke that both Prva and 02, another national broadcaster, were being bought by Kopernikus, a company with close ties to SNS and a staunch supporter of their policies. Ivanovic chose not to continue as the host of \u201cTonight with Ivan Ivanovic.\u201d His last, two-hour new-year-themed program scheduled to air on December 31st was cancelled overnight.\n\nMilan Jovanovic, a small-town investigative journalist from Grocka, suffered a more blatant attack. On December 12, a Molotov cocktail set his house on fire. \u201cMy wife was awoken by our cat, who wanted to get outside, and she heard the shattering of glass against our garage and saw that it had been set on fire,\u201d Jovanovic said. The flames quickly enveloped the entire house. But as they tried to leave, attackers in a car on the street fired at the front door. They managed to make it out safely.\n\nJovanovic is a retired policeman who decided to go into journalism to help out his friend, editor Zeljko Martovic of the independent news site Zig Info: \u201cI was good at procuring documents,\u201d he said. His main target was the mayor of Grocka, Dragoljub Simonovic, who Jovanovic alleges was involved in corrupt gas distribution contracts and other public tenders managed by the local SNS branch. Days after Jovanovic and his wife moved to an apartment in Belgrade after their house was destroyed, someone tried to break into their new home\u2014this time while both of them were awake. It\u2019s \u201cbecome common for us now,\u201d Jovanovic told me. The unknown individual fled.\n\nVucic downplayed the attack on Jovanovic at Davos, saying people shouldn\u2019t rush to judgement, and that the attack might have been \u201cjust another break in.\u201d Jovanovic saw the tepid statement as a green light to all those who want to attack journalists. \u201cIt\u2019s like he\u2019s drawing a bull\u2019s eye on their foreheads,\u201d he said.\n\nAround the same time Jovanovic\u2019s apartment was broken into, Dasko Milinovic, a radio journalist from the northern Serbian city of Novi Sad, and part of a popular online radio duo, was called into the police for a tweet he had posted a couple of days ago on his parody account on Twitter. The satirical tweeter takes on the persona of a pro-Western nationalist, Zapad Todorovic\u2014Zapad means \u201cWest\u201d in Serbian\u2014in many ways mirroring Vucic\u2019s own transformation, and mimics the rhetoric Vucic uses in his public addresses and statements. Pro-government trolls are common in the Serbian Twittersphere. \u201cMy goal with Zapad was to make fun of religious conservatives, the far right, historical revisionists, and they started writing back,\u201d said Milinovic, who consciously uses the language of Serbian nationalists, Colbert-style, to mock them and their policies. In a tweet on December 19th, Milinovic lampooned SNS politician Vladimir Djukanovic for supporting the activities of the Serbian neo-Nazi group \u201cSrbska Akcija,\u201d which had spray-painted the walls of leftist politician Marinika Tepic\u2019s house. \u201cWill the Nazi swine complain if we talk to him the way he talks to others? You fascist boar, you\u2019ll roast on the spit.\u201d Djukanovic reported the tweet to the police, saying Milinovic\u2014despite posting from a clear parody account\u2014had threatened him.\n\nAfter willingly going to the police station, Milinovic was arrested and held overnight for \u201cthreatening the safety of a political representative\u201d\u2014something Milinovic found absurd. The SNS government, he told me, \u201cis prepared to wage a war against even the most marginal and insignificant people in Serbian society, as long as they have a small slice of public attention or following.\u201d\n\nThe day after the Davos panel, the EU\u2019s enlargement commissioner Johannes Hahn posted a photograph with Vucic on Twitter, calling 2018 \u201csuccessful\u201d year for the Western Balkans. Hahn has argued in the past that continuing the EU accession process is the best antidote to any lingering authoritarian ailments in the region. He has also provoked controversy in the past by echoing rhetoric often used by Vucic and his supporters\u2014calling for proof of concerted efforts by the government to stifle the press.\n\nAfter the past month, such calls feel offensive to some Serbian journalists. Amidst the attack on Jovanovic, the cancelling of Ivanovic\u2019s show, and Milinovic\u2019s arrest, a memo to staff in the Air Serbia lounge in Belgrade\u2019s Nikola Tesla airport leaked in late December, urging vigilance about the type of media available in the waiting area for the government-owned airline. \u201cPay special attention to NIN, Vreme and Nedeljnik and newspapers of similar content. They should not be exhibited,\u201d the memo read."

    "text": "The point, I suspect, is not just to flaunt that a writer is free to fill his stories with conspicuous contradictions. Nor is it just to mock us for our own gullibility, which we demonstrate in good canine fashion as Machado trots out his series of false starts. It is also to show that a fiction is a fragile edifice, always subject to the revisionary whims of a capricious author. From the very first, Machado plants in his reader the subtle seeds of what will flower into full-fledged paranoia over the course of the ensuing 922 pages. He revokes so much of what he evokes that we learn to doubt almost everything he says.\n\nMiss Dollar\u2019s wide-eyed owner, to whom she is dutifully returned by the marriageable Dr. Mendon\u00e7a, is too mistrustful to accept even a suitor she adores. Her aunt tells Mendon\u00e7a, one of the thwarted hopefuls, \u201cI believe in the sincerity of your love. I have for a long time, but how to convince a suspicious heart?\u201d\n\nHow to convince a suspicious heart? This question animates the Collected Stories, which recycle and re-recycle the themes and fixations of Machado\u2019s opus, Dom Casmurro. An elegy to anxiety, the novel follows Bento Santiago, a retired lawyer who suspects that his wife and his best friend are having an affair. His deranged memoirs are perfectly poised between the confirmation and allayment of his restless, relentless fears: They withhold the perverse relief of proof, languishing with what sometimes seems like pleasure in the agony of indeterminacy.\n\nThough Machado\u2019s own marriage lasted 35 years and was apparently happy, his sharply suspicious fiction makes us wonder. His favorite love triangles involve not just duplicity but the most brutal betrayals. Men who love their best friends\u2019 wives or love interests recur in \u201cThe Blue Flower,\u201d \u201cErnesto What\u2019s-His-Name,\u201d \u201cThe Fortune Teller,\u201d \u201cA Captain of Volunteers,\u201d and \u201cPylades and Orestes.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s only apt that the Collected Stories are so repetitive: The book is organized just like an obsession, with manic motifs that nag and gnaw. Its stories are crammed with jilted lovers, women with enticing arms and eyes, and scientists who torture mice. Almost all of them have intriguing beginnings and abrupt, twisted endings. One begins, \u201cThat young man standing over there on the corner of Rua Nova do Conde and Campo de Aclama\u00e7ao at ten o\u2019clock at night is not a thief, he\u2019s not even a philosopher.\u201d Another begins:\n\nSo you really think that what happened to me in 1860 could be made into a story? Very well, but on the sole condition that nothing is published before my death. You\u2019ll only have to wait a week at most, for I\u2019m really not long for this world.\n\n\n\nNothing could\u2014and nothing really does\u2014live up to the implicit promise of openings so enigmatic. Yet the deprivations may be intentional: Lack, too, is voluptuous, and many of Machado\u2019s characters willfully resist the satisfaction of their immense and obstinate appetites. In \u201cTrio in A Minor,\u201d a young woman torn between two underwhelming suitors hallucinates a voice proclaiming, \u201cThis is your punishment, O soul in search of perfection; your punishment is to swing back and forth, for all eternity, between two incomplete stars.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cA Sacristan\u2019s Manuscript,\u201d dreamy Eul\u00e1lia \u201cbegan by idealizing things, and, if she did not end up denying them entirely, it is certain that her sense of reality grew thinner and thinner until it reached the fine transparency at which fabric becomes indistinguishable from air.\u201d Determined to await the ideal husband, she remains unmarried for years. The eventual object of her affections is a priest: \u201cShe had clearly found the husband she was waiting for, but he turned out to be as impossible as the life she had dreamed of.\u201d Meanwhile, the narrator, \u201cboth a gastronome and a psychologist,\u201d continues to attend Sunday dinner at the house of the lonely woman. \u201cIf it is true, as Schiller would have it, that love and hunger rule the world, then I am of the firm opinion that something, either love or dinner, must still exist somewhere or other,\u201d he concludes.\n\nThe possessions we have don\u2019t satisfy us, but the ones that elude us infuriate us. This is why even Machado\u2019s most affluent characters remain lavishly unfulfilled.\n\nOne of Machado\u2019s characters, a miser who glimpses a friend\u2019s coin collection, reflects, \u201cThe finest possessions are those we don\u2019t possess.\u201d It follows that we must cede what we have, at least if we hope to go on valuing it. Elizabeth Hardwick wrote in her incisive introduction to Dom Casmurro in 1991 that Machado\u2019s heroes are apt to transform \u201ca consummated love into the unattainable by way of jealousy.\u201d Bento\u2019s ecstatic distrust delivers his wife back over to beguiling inaccessibility, and Machado\u2019s stories are full of comparable divestments. \u201cThe Gold Watch,\u201d one of the best of the earlier stories, transfigures even the quelling of suspicions into suspicion-fodder. When Luis Negreiros finds a gold watch he does not recognize in his living room, he interrogates his wife, Clarinha, about its origins. She responds evasively, and he flies into a rage, grabs her \u201cby the throat,\u201d and threatens to kill her\u2014only to realize that his birthday is the next day and that the watch is Clarinha\u2019s present to him.\n\nThough Clarinha\u2019s name is cleared, it is not clear whether she will be able to forgive her husband for his violent outburst. The story ends on an unsettled note. The possessions we have don\u2019t satisfy us, but the ones that elude us infuriate us. This is why even Machado\u2019s most affluent characters remain, despite their expensive birthday presents, lavishly unfulfilled.\n\nMisery is voluptuous not only for its victims but also for its architects. Machado\u2019s first-person narratives are self-eviscerations: The narrator of Epitaph of a Small Winner writes posthumous memoirs from beyond the grave, and Bento likens his self-examination to an autopsy. Machado\u2019s third-person works are sadistic experiments, full of physicians whose disinterested fascination with the sources of suffering often grades into active cruelty.\n\nMany of them are testaments to their creator\u2019s talent for devising monstrous ironies. In \u201cThe Holiday,\u201d a child discharged early from school eagerly anticipates a surprise party, only to learn that his father has died. In \u201cPosthumous Picture Gallery,\u201d a man named Joaquim Fid\u00e9lis, beloved by all for his exemplary warmth and kindness, dies unexpectedly. His nephew reads his journal and is appalled by his hidden malice. \u201cI have referred to this friend many times and will do so yet again, provided he doesn\u2019t kill me with boredom, a field in which I consider him a true professional,\u201d he wrote of one close friend. Another has \u201cthe warmest heart in the world and a spotless character, but the qualities of his mind destroy all the others.\u201d When the friends Fid\u00e9lis has slandered ask to read his diary, the nephew turns them away. \u201cWhat a difference from his uncle!\u201d the friends chide. \u201cWhat a gulf separates them! Puffed up by his inheritance, no doubt!\u201d\n\nThe best story of all is also the coldest. In the haunting \u201cSecret Cause,\u201d Garcia, a kindly doctor, befriends Fortunato, a philanthropist and the benefactor of a hospital. It soon emerges that Fortunato\u2019s interest in the misfortunes of others is anything but innocuous. One day, Garcia arrives early for a visit at his friend\u2019s house and makes a horrifying discovery:\n\nFortunato was sitting at the table in the middle of the study, and on the table sat a dish of alcohol. The liquid was alight. Between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand he held a piece of string, from which the mouse dangled by its tail. In his right hand was a pair of scissors. At the precise moment Garcia entered the room, Fortunato snipped off one of the mouse\u2019s legs; then he slowly lowered the poor creature into the flame, only briefly so as not to kill it, and then prepared to snip the third leg, for he had already cut off the first before Garcia arrived.\n\n\n\nThe description flails on and on, unable to die: \u201cthe miserable creature writhed and squealed in agony, bloodied and scorched\u2026. Only the last leg remained; Fortunato cut it very slowly, his eyes fixed on the scissors.\u201d When Fortunato\u2019s wife, whom Garcia loves, dies, Fortunato watches Garcia as Garcia once watched him. Garcia, wracked with grief, sobs over the corpse of the departed, and \u201cFortunato quietly savored this outburst of spiritual pain, which went on, and on, for a deliciously long time.\u201d\n\nSo, too, do we luxuriate in the pains and pangs of Machado\u2019s battered characters, whose lingering trials twitch for so many pages. But Machado himself is the true beneficiary of all the opulent violence he conceives, records, and, finally, metes out to his fascinated readers. In \u201cAmong Saints,\u201d the saints who step down from the walls of a church to pass judgment on the congregation \u201chad penetrated into the lives and souls of the faithful and picked apart the feelings of each and every one, just as anatomists dissect a corpse.\u201d They are possessed of \u201cterrifying psychological insight.\u201d Machado is himself a sinister saint. An author, he boasts, \u201ccan scrutinize every nook and cranny of the human heart.\u201d As he picks not only his characters but also his readers apart, dangling us over the open flames, he can already see into our suspicious hearts: He already knows that we will spasm, not just with fear but with a rhapsodic rush of misery. The crowning cruelty is that we will enjoy it."

Northam first issued a statement on Friday night admitting that he was one of the two men in the photo, though he did not specify which one. \u201cThis behavior is not in keeping with who I am today and the values I have fought for throughout my career in the military, in medicine, and in public service,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut I want to be clear, I understand how this decision shakes Virginians\u2019 faith in that commitment.\u201d Northam also implicitly ruled out the possibility that he would step down. \u201cI recognize that it will take time and serious effort to heal the damage this conduct has caused,\u201d he added. \u201cI am ready to do that important work.\u201d\n\nHis response seriously misjudged the mood within Democratic circles, which saw his departure as the only feasible way to heal that damage. Northam then tried to remedy the situation with a press conference on Saturday that ultimately proved his critics right. He retracted his admission that he was in the yearbook photo, telling reporters that he had mixed it up with a time he had actually worn blackface in 1984 to portray Michael Jackson in a look-a-like contest. His explanation for the error\u2014that he was simply eager to \u201creach out and apologize\u201d for whatever had happened\u2014smacked of political expediency instead of a genuine reckoning with his past actions.\n\nIndeed, Northam seemed fundamentally unable to grasp the gravity of the scandal. When a reporter asked if he could still moonwalk like Jackson, Northam looked around as if to find space to prove he could. Only a pointed reminder from his wife\u2014\u201cinappropriate circumstances,\u201d she told him\u2014brought the governor back to reality. \u201cIn light of his public admission and apology for his decision to appear in the photo, he has irrevocably lost the faith and trust of the people he was elected to serve,\u201d the Virginia Black Legislative Caucus said in a statement as the press conference unfolded. \u201cChanging his public story today now casts further doubt on his ability to regain that trust.\u201d\n\nFor all his professed confusion about what took place, Northam seems clear-eyed about the power dynamics at play here. He cannot be forced from office over this scandal: The state constitution only allows impeachment if the governor commits \u201cmalfeasance in office, corruption, neglect of duty, or other high crime or misdemeanor,\u201d none of which has happened here. Virginia\u2019s governors are also limited to a single four-year term in office, so he does not need to appeal to the electorate to win reelection. Northam is, in practical terms, accountable to nothing for the next three years except his conscience.\n\nIdeally, his conscience would be more than enough. Nobody expects a government of saints, of course. That\u2019s why governors and legislators have fixed terms in office and regular opportunities to vote for their replacements. Anti-corruption laws and the power of impeachment even allow for removals from office without elections for the most egregious breaches of the public trust. Before all of that, however, is the underlying premise of public service: that elected officials will act in the public\u2019s best interests and not necessarily their own. Northam\u2019s refusal to step down subordinates those interests to his own political survival."

    "text": "Initially, Zuckerberg was resistant to advertising on the site, believing that it was intrusive and distracted from the user experience. But after Sheryl Sandberg joined the company from Google in 2008\u2014with the directive to make the company profitable\u2014Facebook embraced extensive user tracking and became one of the most powerful advertising companies in the planet. Its revenue has skyrocketed in the last few years, topping $55 billion in 2018.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the company has become so large and complex that it\u2019s possible no one, including Zuckerberg and Sandberg, really understands it. Facebook is a social network, an advertising company, and a data collection hub that relentlessly surveils and profiles its users. It is being utilized by companies wishing to find new customers, as well as governments looking to foil terrorist attacks (and, increasingly, to meddle in the elections and domestic affairs of adversaries). Its advertising business has played a pivotal role in the decimation of the American news media.\n\n\n\nA site that was once a place for centralizing social obligations\u2014a mix of an address book and a scrap book, a place to easily share milestones and memories with family and friends\u2014has grown into a world unto itself that plays a pivotal, and often damaging, role in democracies and dictatorships alike. It has been seized on by hatemongers across the world, who use it to spread misinformation and messages of ethnic division with frightening speed, facilitating murders in India and genocide in Myanmar.\n\n\n\nFacebook did not invent propaganda or misinformation; mass media has been used to spread hate and violence for as long as mass media has existed. It\u2019s possible, perhaps even likely, that many of the malicious acts that are blamed on Facebook would have happened without it, but the social network has nevertheless been a kind of inadvertent pathfinder, a company so convinced of its public utility that it was, until it was too late, blind to its numerous adverse effects. But Facebook has made it easier to unleash these negative forces and to harness the internet for horrific acts, and it will take more than an apology tour to undo the damage.\n\n\n\nFacebook will change dramatically over the next 15 years. The rise of deepfakes is already making the problem of fake news\u2014the real kind, not the Trumpian insult\u2014seem quaint. How will augmented reality be used for evil? We can only imagine. But it requires little imagination to see that Facebook is ill-equipped to handle these future threats, given its utter failure to address myriad crises ranging from its handling of user data to its spread of misinformation that may have compromised elections in the U.S., Germany, and elsewhere.\n\n"

But that\u2019s just what\u2019s happening in Routt County, Colorado. It started in June, when Peabody Energy, the world\u2019s largest privately owned coal producer, failed to pay $1.8 million in property taxes on its Twentymile Mine, the biggest in Colorado. Peabody, the county\u2019s largest single source of tax revenue, had filed for bankruptcy and was negotiating its debts in court. To make up for the shortfall, one local school district was forced to take out a $1 million emergency loan from the state, and a fire department in the county was shorted $60,000.\n\nThen something strange happened. In August, when Peabody finally paid its back taxes, the county turned around and sent the money back.\n\nThe county treasurer rejected a $1.8 million payment from Peabody Energy, the world\u2019s largest privately owned coal producer.\n\nBrita Horn, the county treasurer, rejected the payment because Peabody had failed to include nearly $92,000 in back interest and fees it owed. In a letter to the local Steamboat Today, Horn accused Peabody of demanding special treatment from taxpayers at the same time it was asking the bankruptcy court for permission to reward its executives with lavish bonuses. \u201cIf this office can\u2019t offer a tax break to a single mom who worries about feeding her children,\u201d Horn wrote, \u201cI\u2019m not going to offer one to a corporation that just received permission to pay executives $16 million in bonuses.\u201d\n\nWith natural gas and renewable energy on the rise, coal is no longer the economic mainstay it once was in Routt, a rural county with a population of only 24,130. Output at the Twentymile has plunged more than 40 percent over the past decade, and employment is down from 561 miners in 2009 to only 284. Today mining provides nearly 3 percent of the county\u2019s jobs; recreation and tourism supply 39 percent, and legalized marijuana operations are starting to take off. Peabody\u2019s bankruptcy, and its effect on public services, represents \u201cthe issues and adjustments that coal country and the wider energy sector are having,\u201d says Rob Godby, director of the Energy Economics and Public Policies Center at the University of Wyoming. \u201cOld revenue models no longer work.\u201d"

    "text": "I remember going through that phase. And I think one reason your documentary is going to be important is because a lot of people don\u2019t like to read, or don\u2019t have the time to do it, so they aren\u2019t familiar with the work that people like Michelle Alexander and Bryan Stevenson are doing around justice and criminal reform.\n\nYou can read about these things, but not enough people do. So the hope is that this documentary is a primer about black liberation theory for people who might not have ever heard of some of these ideas before. There is value to having it all in one place, in the documentary. You start to see connections.\n\nIn The 13th, DuVernay included voices from across the political spectrum, seeking \u201ca perspective that will speak to everyone.\u201d Courtesy Netflix\n\nThis was two years of work, right? And you wanted to keep it a secret?\n\nSecrecy is overstating it a little bit. Everything doesn\u2019t have to have a Twitter account. I really didn\u2019t know what the film was, what form it was going to take. When it started, it was about incarceration in the present day. Then it became important to provide a historical context for it, a cultural context for it, a political context for it. I wanted to include folks from different parts of the spectrum\u2014the Right on Crime people versus the Black Lives Matter people.\n\nWhen you watch The 13th, you see how insidious movies have been in terms of fueling the image of \u201cblack equals bad.\u201d How do you as a black director enter that conversation? Do you think about how we can correct those representations? Or do you just go about your work?\n\nThat\u2019s all I think about. I work in an industry that was founded upon the psychology of The Birth of a Nation. If you are a woman in Hollywood, if you are of color, particularly if you\u2019re black, the founding images of cinema are adverse to your very humanity. And if the images of the medium you work in are adverse to your very humanity, then every action is a reaction. So everything I do tries to provide contrast. I try and pivot from the characterization of what women should be, what black people should be, what black women should be. I try to counter the presentation of black life\u2014within Hollywood, within the studio system, within what makes it to theaters.\n\nWith Selma, people came at you about historical correctness. I\u2019ve been doing historical research for my book, and when I went to Mount Vernon, the tour guides didn\u2019t even know what Washington\u2019s quarters for his enslaved people looked like, or how their beds were arranged. Everything they\u2019re doing is interpretation\u2014that\u2019s what they call it. It made me realize that it\u2019s all about who has agency to be a storyteller or a historian.\n\nFor Selma, I sat down with people in the movement who told me what happened. I read diaries, I read journals. Yet the whole white experience was about people who weren\u2019t there telling me I got it wrong. It\u2019s jaw-dropping to me that people believe their truth is the only truth. It\u2019s become the bedrock of the way that we live: \u201cI am right and you are wrong.\u201d But history is in the eye of the beholder. What I said during the whole promotional campaign for Selma was: \u201cYou decide.\u201d I never came in and said, \u201cThis is the only way.\u201d The challenge is to try to create a filter of perspective that will speak to everyone, regardless of their point in the spectrum.\n\nWhat\u2019s the significance of putting out this documentary on prisons right before the election?\n\nI want people to hold our candidates accountable. We need to be asking them what they\u2019re going to do about prison reform. How have you voted on it? Where do you stand? We haven\u2019t asked these questions enough.\n\nDo you really think Bill Clinton didn\u2019t know what his prison policies would lead to? This is something that a lot of my generation feels\u2014that the Clintons were in on it, and that their commitment to black people is flimsy at best.\n\nWhat I try to do is show how in each administration, what the president wanted to achieve was for his own political gain, and the weapon by which they do that against their political opponent was the black body. It\u2019s been ongoing knowledge that the black body triggers fear, it triggers opposition, it triggers the standard tropes of protection and defense and all those things that allow a politician to do whatever they\u2019re going to do. The through line is simply, \u201cOh, the blacks\u2014we\u2019ll get what we need from them, whether it\u2019s in the cotton field or in creating fear.\u201d\n\nWere you surprised by the forms that this maneuvering and fearmongering took?\n\nAs someone who thinks deeply about these issues, and who for a long time thought it was all made by Republicans, it was striking to really break it down and to look at the Democrats\u2019 part in this. In general, the master plan has been: \u201cThis is how you get what you want.\u201d It has been applied and used by every different kind of non-black person throughout the generations. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have a timeline\u2014so we see how we\u2019ve been used over the centuries for political gain, for financial gain, for cultural gain.\n\nIt\u2019s jaw-dropping to me that people believe their truth is the only truth.\n\nI was gutted by the clips you show of Eric Garner. One of the questions you bring up in the documentary is: Should we be watching these videos of police violence that have gone viral? What do you think about the use of cameras to log how we are treated?\n\nIt\u2019s important for us to talk about the ways in which black people have asked the wider world to bear witness to their pain over time. So much of the civil rights movement was orchestrated for newspapers, for cameras. The reason Selma popped the way it did was because it invaded American televisions for the first time. That image was powerful, and we\u2019re in this current moment because of images. There is no tape of Trayvon Martin, there is no tape of Michael Brown, of the actual acts against them. All you have are images of the bodies, prone and gone. But it\u2019s not just the body\u2014it\u2019s the life taken from the body. So those images need to be balanced with images of black humanity not in distress and chaos.\n\nDid you get scared with this documentary at any point?\n\nScared? No, not scared. I cried a lot.\n\nYou did?\n\nThere are a couple sections in there that break me every time I look at them. Many people behind bars never had a trial. That\u2019s one of the things most viewers are stunned about\u2014stunned about how much money is being made from prisons, stunned at laws that are written by folks who are not lawmakers, stunned about where the whole idea of criminality and black men and white women and all that stuff comes from.\n\nDo you think we should be optimistic about prison reform?\n\nAt one point I thought, \u201cShould we be more hopeful?\u201d So I included a sequence of everyone who\u2019s in the documentary saying who they are and what they do. But I took it out, because I felt like I was saying, \u201cHere\u2019s the problem, but don\u2019t worry, these people are working on it.\u201d It was too hopeful. Viewers should be uncomfortable and walk out of there thinking, \u201cFuck, I gotta do something.\u201d\n\nHow did you become a director? You were at UCLA, but you weren\u2019t a film student.\n\nI wrote for the black student newspaper called NOMMO, and was involved in black student politics, and rapped at the Good Life Caf\u00e9 on Crenshaw.\n\nYou rapped?\n\nOh yeah.\n\nWere you good?\n\nWhat MC doesn\u2019t say they\u2019re good? If you don\u2019t say you\u2019re good, then you\u2019re not a dope MC. One of my first films, This Is the Life, was about the artists who were rhyming at the Good Life. It was very famous\u2014an underground thing, known around the world\u2014and it stood in opposition to the gangsta rap that was coming out at the time. So that\u2019s what I was doing while I was in college. I was learning about the world and my place in it.\n\nWhat films were you watching at the time?\n\nIn Westwood, they have these great, single-house movie theaters that play only one movie, and they would show independent films. I remember seeing Ruby in Paradise. It had a pace I felt an affection for, a pace that was luxurious, that really allowed me to live in someone else\u2019s shoes. The films I might have been interested in as a young person didn\u2019t play near me, because there\u2019s no movie theater in Compton. You can\u2019t see Straight Outta Compton in Compton. You can\u2019t see Selma in Selma. It\u2019s cinema segregation. Even if I was interested in independent films at that time, I would\u2019ve had to get on a bus to take me across town, which is not possible. I\u2019m not getting from Lynwood to Westwood. It only happened when I went to UCLA. And how many of us went to UCLA?\n\nWhat made you want to make A Wrinkle in Time? Did you like the book?\n\nI never read the book. I knew it was a kind of classic.\n\nLike, a really dorky classic.\n\nIt was a black executive at Disney, Tendo Nagenda, and another executive, Sean Bailey, an independent producer turned studio head. They pushed me to read it. I was like, \u201cI\u2019m busy. I already know I\u2019m not gonna want to do it.\u201d So they send me the graphic novel\u2014not the book. One night it\u2019s late, and I pick it up and end up reading into the middle of the night. At 3 a.m. I buy the book online and spend the rest of the night reading. I fell in love with it instantly. I felt like it was mine.\n\nThat book grew me. Meg Murry is every smart girl. She embodies the smart-girl struggle of being perceived as both stupid and weird.\n\nOne of the things that really interested me about the story is that it centers on a girl, and it deals with technology and science and love and darkness and light and time travel and breaking time and space, all these concepts. But what was really interesting to me was: What if these were brown kids traveling through the universe?\n\nWait\u2014so Meg is gonna be a black girl? And her brother Charles Wallace is a black boy? That brings tears to my eyes. I can\u2019t even imagine it. It really is an abolitionist story, a black story.\n\nI won\u2019t give too much away, but yes\u2014they\u2019re biracial. Their father is white and their mother is black.\n\nI brought my copy of A Wrinkle in Time with me today. I used to write my name all over it. We dorky black girls were never presented with visions of ourselves in the media. We had Denise Huxtable, I guess, but it helps to be a dork if you\u2019re absolutely conventionally stunning. This\u2014like, wow, this is progress.\n\nIt\u2019s funny that you thought Meg Murry was going to be a white girl.\n\nI did. I thought, \u201cHow is this gonna work?\u201d But it seems like things are slowly starting to change in Hollywood. Now there\u2019s the \u201cDuVernay Test\u201d\u2014the idea proposed by Manohla Dargis that African Americans should live fully realized lives in films, rather than serving as props in white stories. Did you think that was cool?\n\nI did. That kind of thing is important. I liked what it was saying, and it was flattering.\n\nYou\u2019ve achieved an enormous amount in a short time. It is incredible.\n\nI feel like I have a short window, to be honest with you. I feel like I have to make the most of this time, because there\u2019s not anyone I can look to who\u2019s had a long window who\u2019s a woman, period. A black person, period. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s there beyond four films, because none of us have done it. There is no black woman who\u2019s made seven films. So for me it feels like a window that could close at any time. It doesn\u2019t feel fast like, \u201cWow, this happened fast.\u201d It feels fast like, \u201cBetter get it in.\u201d Before it closes."

This unrestricted cash prize of $100,000 per recipient is awarded to freelance journalists for excellence in long-form, narrative, or deep reporting about underrepresented and/or misrepresented groups in the American landscape. We created the prize as part of our work that supports journalism as an essential arm of U.S. democracy\u2014recognizing that we live in a time when journalism seems both vulnerable and deeply needed, with the ability to expose audiences to new perspectives and bring about understanding.\n\nToday, we are pleased to announce the newest recipients of this prize: Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah and Abe Streep.\n\nMs. Ghansah and Mr. Streep join 2018 recipients Jaeah Lee and Valeria Fern\u00e1ndez as the freelance journalists to receive this new journalism prize, first awarded last year.\n\nThe prize\u2014a complete surprise to its recipients\u2014is based on confidential nominations from leaders in journalism throughout the country. The recipients were selected by 10 esteemed judges who this year included journalists from the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, NBC/Telemundo, NPR, Buzzfeed News, Columbia University, Barnard College, and freelance journalism.\n\nWe could not be more pleased with the judges\u2019 selection for the 2019 recipients.\n\n\u201cAmerican Mosaic Journalism Prize recipients take us inside the lives of people whose stories we need to hear,\u201d notes Foundation Board Chair Liz Simons. \u201cThese accomplished freelancers deliver the kind of nuance and honesty that can only be imparted by the long-form investigative journalism that is their craft. The urgency of their work grows with every year.\u201d\n\nAs the citations from the 2019 prize judges note:\n\n\u201cRachel Kaadzi Ghansah\u2019s deeply reported and essayistic writing pushes the form of longform journalism, ranging from a poignant profile of master painter Henry Taylor to a searing expos\u00e9 of the hotbed of racism and white supremacy that fueled the heinous murder of nine African-Americans in Charleston, South Carolina. Her power of observation and nuanced writing both shines light on Black Americans and dares us to look at the forces that shape race in America.\u201d\n\nAnd, \u201cAbe Streep\u2019s reporting bursts with compassion and urgency as he lifts up stories of often-overlooked communities in the American West, such as a Syrian refugee family building a new life in Montana, or a Native American high-school basketball team grappling with a flurry of suicides in its community. With great sensitivity, his work reveals the rich tapestry of cultures and lives that intersect in a part of the country far too often characterized by the stereotypes of an urban-rural divide.\u201d\n\nWe invite you to learn more about Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah and Abe Streep, and read their extraordinary work, by visiting the prize\u2019s page on our website."

    "authors": [
      "Andrew Cohen"
    ],
    "text": "\u201cThe evidence of systematic race discrimination during jury selection in this case is undeniable,\u201d wrote Judge John Allen. And not just undeniable, in Judge Allen\u2019s view, but patently intentional. He devoted nearly 10 pages of his 27-page ruling chronicling how prosecutors purposely violated Gates\u2019s constitutional rights by deploying one racist tactic after another. And then, after all that, the judge declared that he could not grant Gates a new trial based on this discrimination because of a six-part procedural standard Georgia courts apply in requests to overturn old convictions.\n\nEvery state has built into its criminal justice system rules designed to bring a measure of certainty and finality to old convictions. It makes sense. We all can agree that defendants cannot forever be entitled to raise new claims. But in Georgia, and in other states, the barriers to new evidence are way too high. For example, Gates had to prove that he didn\u2019t know about the jury discrimination when it occurred at trial, that it wasn\u2019t his fault that he didn\u2019t learn of it until decades later, and that the discovery of the prosecutorial misconduct \u201cprobably\u201d would have changed the outcome of his trial.\n\nThe judge didn\u2019t explain why the proof of intentional racial discrimination wasn\u2019t enough to grant Gates a new trial. It can\u2019t be because Gates\u2019s lawyers were diligent in seeking to raise the issue. The judge inexplicably didn\u2019t mention in his motion how hard Georgia officials fought to keep secret those old notes from Gates, the ones that proved the racism at the heart of the 1977 trial. Instead, Judge Allen ultimately found that Gates deserved a second chance because newly discovered DNA evidence demonstrated \u201cthat he is excluded as the contributor to the DNA of two key items of physical evidence\u201d in the case.\n\nGates is lucky in a sense. The case against him was so weak, and the evidence of official misconduct so pervasive, that his lawyers were able to surmount the procedural obstacles put into place by Georgia judges and legislators. But many other defendants in Georgia and beyond continue to serve wrongful convictions. The problem is acute, especially, when convicted defendants try to establish that their lawyers provided them with ineffective assistance of counsel. The problem has been eased in the past decade or so, on the other hand, when it comes to post-conviction DNA testing, thanks in large part to the Innocence Project.\n\nAt the heart of the matter is the role of reviewing courts. We all are taught in high school about how the system of appellate review in this country is supposed to weed out mistakes at trial. But over time, the system has devolved to the point where it tolerates, even encourages, unjust results. With one piece of legislation, Georgia could make it easier for defendants like Gates to establish their right to a new trial. Eliminate the need for a defendant to prove the new evidence \u201cprobably\u201d would have generated a different result. Redefine what \u201cdue diligence\u201d means where, as in Gates\u2019s case, prosecutors or police are hiding evidence."

    "text": "Though some advocated for across-the-board reform, the dominant approach that emerged was providing vocational training for working-class students. These students dropped out of school at far greater rates than their more privileged peers, often because they needed to support their families financially. Yet the dominant assumption among reformers was that these students lacked the intellectual capacity to complete the standard curriculum. Insofar as that was the case, vocationalism was framed as a solution for keeping the slow-witted in school. Vocational education, wrote David Snedden, a policy leader in the early twentieth century, would be for \u201cthose who will do duty in the ranks, who will follow, not lead.\u201d\n\nFor the next several decades, vocational education was a key feature of the comprehensive high school, which was organized around a trio of academic tracks. High-ability students would take college-preparatory classes; average-ability students would receive the standard curriculum; and low-ability students would train to work with their hands. According to Harvey Kantor, most educational systems developed \u201cnew procedures in guidance and placement to sort and select students for jobs and into educational tracks.\u201d\n\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, however, vocational education came under increasing attack as an inherently inequitable approach to schooling. As a 1973 law review article concluded, pulling students out of the academic program was a move \u201cBased on the hopeless conclusion that \u2018these kids are dumb\u2019 and cannot be educated.\u201d UCLA professor Mike Rose recalled his own experience with tracking: \u201cIf you\u2019re a working-class kid in the vocational track \u2026 you\u2019re defined by your school as \u2018slow\u2019 [and] you\u2019re placed in a curriculum that isn\u2019t designed to liberate you but to occupy you.\u201d\n\nVocational education also faced another kind of criticism: that it simply couldn\u2019t be done well in the schools. Skilled instructors were hard to recruit and retain, particularly in light of their qualifications for private-sector work. Equipment was expensive and went quickly out of date. Learning generally occurred in isolation from important real-world contexts. And schools were severely limited in the number of trades they could reasonably promote.\n\nParticipation in vocational education has steadily declined over the past several decades. It does live on, re-branded as Career and Technical Education, and some research does find that vocational training can increase student retention and earning power. Other scholarship, however, has continued to raise questions about the over-representation of low-income students in vocational \u201cdumping grounds.\u201d\n\nWhen critics contend that America\u2019s public schools are preparing students for the jobs of the past, they are engaging in a kind of rhetorical feint. The implication is that today\u2019s students are already being trained for work, and that such a focus has always been an aim of schooling. It suggests that vocational training is something that Americans broadly agree upon, and that is simply in need of an update.\n\nIn reality, workforce preparation would represent a significant shift in the mission of schools. President Donald Trump made this shift plain in 2018 when he unveiled a plan to combine the Department of Education with the Department of Labor into a new agency called the Department of Education and the Workforce. (There seems to be little movement on the proposal since it was announced.)\n\nJobs certainly matter, and the future labor productivity of today\u2019s students will impact the entire economy. Yet even if schools could be reoriented to focus effectively on job training, the result would hardly be an unqualified good. Any shift in the present orientation of schools will come at the expense of school activities organized around the preservation of rights and liberties, as well as the inherent value of education. By and large, Americans of the past were unwilling to make that trade-off. If they\u2019re aware of what\u2019s happening, Americans of the present may be no different.\n\n\n\n*A previous version of this article stated that the Times editorial was published in 1890."

    "text": "Beijing started out projecting confidence. \u201cChina has a lot of experience in taming a new American president, and Trump should be no exception,\u201d an editorial in the Chinese edition of the Global Times confidently affirmed, belying any initial shock at the billionaire\u2019s victory. \u201cChina is used to dealing with businessmen, and in this way, he may be easier to handle than Hillary,\u201d claimed Jin Canrong, a high-profile international relations professor.\n\nOnly in recent months has the tone changed. By some accounts bewildered, Chinese officials now affect admiration. \u201cI have just spent a week in Beijing talking to officials and intellectuals, many of whom are awed by his skill as a strategist and tactician,\u201d wrote Mark Leonard in the Financial Times in July 2018, amidst the impact of the tariff contest. Although it\u2019s possible, even likely, officials were feeding remarks intended to inveigle Trump (even depicting him, for example, as a \u201cSun Tzu-like strategic genius\u201d), he has genuine admirers among their ranks. Some Chinese buy into the \u201csuccessful businessman\u201d blather, and see a pragmatic venerable elder\u2014something he would have to be to have survived in China\u2014rather than an aging grifter, as he is more usually seen in the West.\n\nMao delighted in turmoil, urging his base to unleash havoc at mass rallies.\n\nAt 72, Trump, after all, is only two years older than the People\u2019s Republic will be in October; none of its leaders could have successfully endured his repeated humiliations, bankruptcies, or public exposures without being arrested or disappeared. It\u2019s widely believed, for example, that the country\u2019s youngest billionaire, 42-year-old Jack Ma, did not volunteer his own resignation as CEO of e-commerce giant Alibaba last summer, but privately accepted it. As overseer of both a vast Amazon-like structure, and digital payment network, Ma was close to commanding an enterprise larger than his own government, and arguably too rich to jail. Trump\u2019s dogged survival skills may impress those for whom politics and business is more literally a life-or-death daily struggle.\n\nIf China\u2019s negotiators truly have arrived at a state of puzzled esteem (a debatable thesis, as Trump\u2019s thirst for flattery has become an international punchline at this point), it may also have something to do with disillusionment at his opponent: Xi\u2019s star does not shine as brightly as it once did. The days when the General Secretary could make a speech at the UN about women\u2019s rights, or laud free markets at Davos, and the media would broadly sing along, have petered out. The once and future reformist, strongman, and free-market debutante seems diminished, even if no one in his circle or society is telling him so. His lack of momentum is the source of an entire system encompassing many careers and institutes: the Xi Jinping Thought industry, dedicated to analyzing the Chinese leader\u2019s \u201chodgepodge of Dengist and Maoist terminology\u201d and \u201cvague ideas,\u201d as The Economist once summed it up, into submission\u2014or at least something resembling an ideology.\n\nTrump\u2019s popularity with certain Chinese elites is likely to make Xi more paranoid than ever. Like other PRC leaders, Xi is largely insulated from public opinion, and seemed barely able to field even a single question without losing composure at the only foreign press conference he\u2019s ever assented to, in 2014. PRC politics is opaque by design, with Xi\u2019s dogma and rhetoric boring all but the most dedicated observers into disinterest. American politics is, by contrast, a smorgasbord of openly competing interests, with rapidly shifting dynamics. Trump exults in the office, but detests the responsibilities; Xi, meanwhile, is minutely obsessed with controlling all aspects of governance. Trump courts attention, and is perpetually aghast at seeing his inadequacies paraded by the press; Xi crushes critics, then demands their adulation.\n\nWhen Bush lost his dinner in 1992, his Japanese hosts discreetly declined to air any footage on public television. Now, the overseas-facing English-language Twitter for People\u2019s Daily Online openly trolls Trump. \u201cOne by one,\u201d the account tweeted with a smiley face, upon news of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke\u2019s departure from the Trump administration.\n\nXi\u2019s personality of cult and centralization of power has caused many to compare him to Mao. In fact, Xi\u2019s obsession with order bears little resemblance to Mao, who ruled through division, turning lieutenants upon lieutenants, purging rivals. Mao delighted in turmoil, urging his base to unleash havoc at mass rallies. \u201cAll under heaven is in chaos,\u201d his motto ran. \u201cThe situation is excellent.\u201d Of today\u2019s leaders, the one who most closely hews to this playbook is not Mao\u2019s successor, but his American rival."

    "text": "If there\u2019s anything that you might already know about the new Matthew McConaughey movie Serenity, it\u2019s that it contains a big twist. And if there\u2019s anything you know about the big critics\u2019 reviews, it\u2019s that they are negative and full of spoilers. The New Yorker\u2019s Richard Brody wrote in his pan that \u201c[t]here\u2019s almost nothing of consequence to discuss in Serenity that isn\u2019t a spoiler, but there\u2019s almost nothing in it that\u2019s not spoiled in advance.\u201d But if you like seeing authentically unusual movies, then ignore the haters: In its fusion of disparate genres, its sentimentality, and its weirdness, Serenity is actually worth watching. For a spoiler-free appreciation of this strange chunk of cinema, read on. I bet you can\u2019t guess the twist.\n\nWe begin with the flash of a fin underwater. Though at first it seems like this fish is a bit of scenery, it actually turns out to be a central character in the movie. Our rugged hero Baker Dill (McConaughey) is a fisherman living on the Floridian island of Plymouth, and he\u2019s obsessed with a tuna named Justice. He spars with his friend Duke (Djimon Hounsou) and everybody else in town who thinks he\u2019s crazy. \u201cI fish tuna,\u201d Baker says. \u201cYou fish one tuna, man,\u201d the villager replies. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the tuna in your head.\u201d\n\nBeneath the ripple of McConaughey\u2019s muscle and the bright sunshine that plays on the water, the ghost of Hemingway stirs. Perhaps his most famous story, Hemingway\u2019s The Old Man and the Sea told of an elderly Cuban fisherman who, much like Baker Dill, hunts an elusive marlin in the Gulf Stream. In that story, the fisherman battles as much with fate as with the fish. Like Baker, he confronts the sea\u2019s unknowability and frames its mystery in gendered terms: \u201cThe old man always thought of [the sea] as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favours, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought.\u201d According to Baker, the best way to catch tuna is by moonlight.\n\nBaker is fighting a lot of things, literally and allegorically. He fights with an inexplicable compulsion to catch \u201cJustice,\u201d an aptly named prize that eludes him. Who is keeping him from this fulfillment? At the movie\u2019s start, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s women (he sleeps with a strange woman named Constance (Diane Lane) for cash, for fishing hooks) or fortune itself (in Hemingway\u2019s story, the fisherman is cursed with salao, a Spanish word meaning both \u201csalty\u201d and \u201cvery bad luck\u201d)."

    "text": "Other conservatives soon joined the chorus, however. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, who also chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to FBI Director Chris Wray this week asking for more details about Stone\u2019s arrest. \u201cI am concerned about the manner in which the arrest was effectuated, especially the number of agents involved, the tactics employed, the timing of the arrest, and whether the FBI released details of the arrest and the indictment to the press prior to providing this information to Mr. Stone\u2019s attorneys,\u201d Graham wrote. Representative Doug Collins, the ranking Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee, sent a similar letter.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Stone\u2019s arrest was atypical\u2014in that it ranked pretty low on the spectrum of police militarization. The Washington Post\u2019s Radley Balko, who has more experience covering police use-of-force problems than just about anyone, had a more measured take on what Stone experienced. \u201cA dozen agents w/ guns out seems excessive,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t look like SWAT team. Wasn\u2019t a no-knock. No explosives. No dynamic entry. Maybe not ideal, but far better treatment than your average pot dealer.\u201d\n\nOther responses suggest that partisan concerns may be a greater factor here than genuine issues with law enforcement policy. Hannity, a fervent loyalist of President Trump, responded to the arrest with his usual partisan umbrage. Why, he asked, weren\u2019t obvious crooks like Hillary Clinton, former CIA Director John Brennan, or former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper facing the same treatment? \u201cWe are a democratic republic,\u201d he inveighed. \u201cThe Constitution that we cherish so much is the foundation of all law and order in this country. If you don\u2019t apply the laws equally, only going after one group of people because of their political views, and you protect people with other political views, you\u2019ve lost our Constitution. We\u2019ve lost our country.\u201d\n\nEven typically cooler heads on the right spoke up in Stone\u2019s defense. Napolitano, a Fox News legal analyst, is usually a voice of moderation in conservative circles when it comes to the Russia investigation. \u201cNo innocent American merits the governmental treatment Stone received,\u201d he wrote in an op-ed on Thursday. \u201cIt was the behavior of a police state where the laws are written to help the government achieve its ends, not to guarantee the freedom of the people\u2014and where police break the laws they are sworn to enforce. Regrettably, what happened to Roger Stone could happen to anyone.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat happened to Roger Stone can indeed happen to anyone. It just rarely happens to people like Roger Stone. Police militarization is a widespread problem in American society. It erodes trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve, and may therefore have a counterproductive effect on crime rates and police violence. While it may have been overkill to send twelve armed and armored federal agents to arrest the 66-year-old Stone before dawn, it\u2019s certainly not extraordinary under American standards. His experience just happens to be more commonly experienced by communities of color and Americans from disadvantaged backgrounds."

    "text": "Cute, I know! But can we be sure that this puppy football is entirely safe? Not that the Puppy Bowl needs a concussion protocol, or to test for PEDs\u2014though I did pose those issues to spokeswoman Melissa Berry, who replied, \u201cAll the puppies are safe and well taken care of.\u201d All players receive a pre-game veterinary checkup, she said. A vet is also on site during filming, as is a monitor from the American Humane Association\u2014an organiztion the Hollywood Reporter recently exposed in an investigation into \u201ctroubling cases of animal injury and death that directly call into question the 136-year-old Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit\u2019s assertion that \u2018No Animals Were Harmed\u2019 on productions it monitors.\u201d What\u2019s more, Mother Jones this month raised questions about the Animal Planet show \u201cCall of the Wildman,\u201d alleging \u201cevidence of a culture that tolerated legally and ethically dubious activities, including: using an animal that had been drugged with sedatives in violation of federal rules; directing trappers to procure wild animals, which were then 'caught' again as part of a script.\u201d So while I doubt that Puppy Bowl players are harmed, it\u2019s not inconceivable.\n\nThe Puppy Bowl\u2019s heart is in the right place. The puppies come from animal shelters and rescue groups across the U.S., including The SATO Project, which rescues dogs from Puerto Rico\u2019s infamous Dead Dog Beach. (Google it, if you dare. As Berry says, \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty nasty situation.\u201d) Having already performed in the bowl, which was taped in late October, those puppies that weren\u2019t already in the process of being adopted or weren\u2019t adopted by Puppy Bowl crew members have been returned to their keepers, ready to be adopted by one of the Puppy Bowl\u2019s 12 million heart-melted viewers.\n\nThat's a lot of people, especially for basic cable, and they're all tuning in to watch something they could watch live, in person, for free, at their nearest pet shop. Does our obsession with puppies specifically, and cuteness generally, know no bounds? The internet replies: Nope, no bounds! We will look at puppies ad infinitum and sine nauseum, because evolution: The New Republic's Alice Robb noted earlier this week that \"a team of psychologists led by Jessika Golle at the University of Bern argue based on students\u2019 reactions to babies\u2019 and puppies\u2019 faces that there is a universal mechanism underlying our appreciation of both animals and babies.\" Hard-wired this way or not, we are a race of slack-jawed zombies, stalking cuteness. It\u2019s a human weakness that\u2019s worth fighting\u2014especially if you love puppies.\n\nThere's a reason we have thousands of animal shelters and rescue groups in America: Some humans cannot resist \u201csaving\u201d a sad puppy they\u2019ve spotted through a pet store window, impulse-buying it for themselves, a loved one, a child. That purchase may have temporarily freed one pup\u2014at least until little Jimmy grows bored of it\u2014but it also implicitly supported large-scale commercial dog breeders, otherwise known as puppy mills. All you really need to know about them can be found on Google Images. \"There are about 10,000 puppy mill facilities in the United States pumping out three to four million dogs per year,\" says Melanie Kahn, senior director of the Humane Society's puppy mill campaign. That's around the same number of homeless, adoptable dogs that are euthanized in shelters every year, she said.\n\nChristmas is an especially popular time for puppy purchases, and around now\u2014late January, early February\u2014says Kahn, \"We tend to see a flood of puppies being given up to shelters by owners. A lot of them end up in shelters because having a puppy is like having a child.... They're a lot of work. You have to train them. They\u2019re up every few hours at night when they\u2019re young.\u201d (Sixty percent of dogs in shelters were surrendered by owners. The rest are strays\u2014abandoned by individual owners or puppy mills, or the offspring of the abandoned.) If everyone listened to the Humane Society and Animal Planet's pleas to adopt dogs rather than buying them\u2014or, if you insist on paying for a dog, using responsible breeders\u2014then it would not only put puppy mills out of business, but possibly solve the crisis of dog overpopulation in America.\n\nThere's a reason, though, that it's not called the \"Dog Bowl\": We are not nearly as obsessed with dogs in general as we are with puppies, and it stands to reason that Puppy Bowl viewers would crave ownership of a puppy, specifically. But most dogs, in shelters or elsewhere, are not puppies for a simple biological reason. \"Lest we forget, puppies grow up,\u201d Kahn, who has never seen the Puppy Bowl, says. \"At some point they won't be little tiny and cute.\u201d That's easy to forget when you're strolling around your local mall, looking for a gift for your teenage daughter or newlywed husband, or not looking for anything at all, and you pass a puppy bowl of a different sort\u2014a glass tank with cedar shavings scattered thinly across the floor. Your human eyes meet a puppy's eyes. In that moment, for reasons evolutionary or cultural or some combination thereof, it's all over. You are sold. As Berry says, \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who could not smile looking at a pile of puppies.\u201d\n\nI know one person, anyway."

    "text": "The greatest obstacle, however, may be the Senate itself. Like the Electoral College, the chamber has a structural rural bias that lends Republicans disproportionate power. But Mitch McConnell\u2019s reign over the chamber has also showed how it can be a mortal threat to basic governance. The Kentucky senator, who proudly declared that his top goal after the 2008 election was to make sure Obama would be a one-term president, often rejected policy negotiations with Democrats so he could blame Obama for the resulting dysfunction. His iron grip on the Senate\u2019s flow of business amid the current shutdown shows how Republicans\u2019 structural advantage in one legislative chamber gives them an undemocratic veto on the country\u2019s political agenda.\n\n\n\nSome observers have also proposed scrapping the legislative filibuster, which would reduce the need for Democrats to obtain buy-ins on major legislation from conservative members and moderate Republicans. Some 2020 contenders like Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand have also backed statehood for the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Creating two new states would strengthen democracy in both places and dilute the Republicans\u2019 structural advantage in the Senate. But there\u2019s also no reason to stop there: full statehood for American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands would also be a good idea if those territories desire it.\n\nBritish lawmakers used a similar maneuver to bring their upper legislative chamber to heel in the early twentieth century. David Lloyd George, the Liberal Party\u2019s chancellor of the exchequer, first introduced what became known as the \u201cPeople\u2019s Budget\u201d in 1909. It proposed a vast expansion of the nation\u2019s social safety net that would be financed itself through aggressive tax hikes on landowners and the wealthiest British citizens. The House of Lords\u2019 members naturally refused to pass a budget that would tax themselves so heavily, even after the Liberals had won another general election and a clear popular mandate for it. What began as a policy dispute had become a constitutional crisis.\n\nLloyd George found a radical solution. With King George V\u2019s support, he threatened to elevate hundreds of new Liberal dukes, viscounts, and barons to take control of the House of Lords and pass reforms that would strip away the Lords\u2019 ability to block legislation. The aristocracy backed down in 1910 and approved the budget, but Lloyd George and the Commons persisted in forcing them to accept the Parliament Act the following year, which replaced the Lords\u2019 ability to vote down legislation with the power to delay it for two years. Creating a dozen new Senate seats out of territories long deprived of influence in Congress seems almost tame by comparison.\n\nAs dramatic as it may sound, there is abundant precedent for reshaping the Senate\u2019s balance of power through new states. Early American statesmen regularly used the creation of free and slave states to maintain the political equilibrium between the North and the South before the Civil War. When Southern senators withdrew from the Senate to join the rebellion in 1860, the Republican Party suddenly found itself able to pass a wave of stymied legislation: land-grant colleges, a transcontinental railroad, the first federal income tax, and more. Statehood also bypasses the unique obstacle of Article V of the Constitution, which forbids the ratification of amendments that alter any state\u2019s \u201cequal representation\u201d in the Senate unless the state itself consents to the changes.\n\nBold political reforms often went hand-in-hand with social and economic reforms throughout American history. Radical Republicans and black freedpeople fought to build a multiracial democracy in the South and ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, laying the groundwork for future civil rights triumphs. Reformers in the Progressive Era passed universal suffrage for women and mandated the direct election of senators. The 1950s and 1960s saw the end of poll taxes and literacy tests, the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the establishment of the \u201cone man, one vote\u201d principle by the Supreme Court.\n\nBut progressives today have given short shrift to potential structural changes to the American political system. At the same time, Republicans haven\u2019t been shy about using their political power over the past decade to mold the nation\u2019s political structures in their favor, whether through aggressive partisan gerrymandering, a wave of restrictive voting laws, or refusing to let Obama change the Supreme Court\u2019s ideological balance. These successes have made it even more difficult for Democrats to capture and hold the House, the Senate, and the presidency simultaneously. But when they do, in 2020 or later, they have to be ready to use the opportunity to untilt the balance of power. Because they may not get another one."

    "text": "The arrival of the internet, and Craigslist in particular, was devastating to newspapers and magazines, which had enjoyed a longstanding monopoly on print ads, classified, and otherwise. But this disruption merely accelerated existing trends. Newspapers\u2019 market penetration began a moderate decline after the advent of television in the 1950s, while print circulation began to dip during the Reagan administration, years before the digital revolution.\n\nSurveillance has been the key to the rising dominance of Google and Facebook. The old model could only offer a localized readership: If you were a shoe store in Scranton, Pennsylvania, you would advertise in the Scranton Tribune and hope to reach people looking for new Air Jordans. Today, Google and Facebook can provide detailed information about millions of users, allowing national outlets to micro-target sneakerheads. These sites, as Mathis-Lilley notes, have also become the source of news and information for hundreds of millions of people:\n\n\n\nMoreover, many people now use the two tech giants\u2019 sites/apps as their \u201cfront page\u201d for finding news\u2014all told, for example, Google and Facebook users click links to Slate about 18 million times every month. And the tech giants get to show users ads next to those links, ads that relate to the stories\u2019 subject matter. News sites don\u2019t get a cut of that either, and they can\u2019t bargain for it by threatening to make their sites inaccessible from Google and Facebook because doing so would instantly cut their audiences in half if not more.\n\nThis is a big problem for just about everyone hoping to reach a paying audience\u2014with Facebook and Google essentially taking a finders fee for all online advertising. But it\u2019s especially tricky for news outlets, who struggle to monetize stories that appear in Facebook and Google. Breaking up their ad duopoly would undoubtedly help, as it would add more competition to the online advertising space\u2014though a ban on tracking, and therefore making advertising less efficient, would probably also have to be implemented. This would create a more equitable economic arrangement, but there\u2019s no reason to believe that this alone will solve the journalism industry\u2019s financial woes.\n\nOther changes will be necessary, such as increased regulation of hedge funds and private equity and a commitment of public investment, particularly for local journalism. Some large-scale digital companies like BuzzFeed can make the case to investors that scale will lead to profitability\u2014even if they may be incapable of producing the level of returns that venture capitalists demand. But smaller outlets, especially those tied to a geographic area, face a host of greater hurdles: diminishing readerships, a decline in small businesses (and thus in the advertising base), and the increasing centrality of New York and Washington, D.C., which drain talent and investment from elsewhere.\n\n\n\nLast year, New Jersey took a miniscule step in the right direction, pledging $5 million to fund local news. Facebook and Google have also taken minor, mostly inconsequential steps to boost local reporting: Google\u2019s Bulletin provides crowdsourced news, while Facebook pledged to put more local news into its News Feed. But what\u2019s needed is sweeping reform and an allocation of billions to help fund local reporting. CJR\u2019s Emily Bell has suggested that tech companies spend billions funding journalism, in part as a kind of reparations for the economic harm that they\u2019ve caused. \u201cWhat independent journalism needs more than ever from Silicon Valley is a significant transfer of wealth,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf, instead of scrapping over news initiatives, the four or five leading technology companies could donate $1 billion in endowment each for a new type of engine for independent journalism, it would be more significant a contribution than a thousand scattered initiatives put together.\u201d"

    "text": "For many men, living up to that socially sanctioned definition amidst inexorable physical and economic insecurity is impossible.\n\nThe Promundo research, which included a nationally representative household survey of 1,000 male and 1,000 female participants, focus group discussions with both men and women, as well as other interviews with men, complements other findings that Afghani gender norms, which many thought the fall of the Taliban would improve, have resisted change: A 2016 Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit ( AREU) study showed Afghan men across generations believed men to be superior to women when it came to leadership qualities and levels of education and thought that men held the primary responsibility for the security of their families. More than half of young and more mature men thought wife-beating was acceptable. \u201cOur talks and discussions about women\u2019s rights are all as slogans but nothing in action,\u201d one AREU focus group participant told researchers. \u201cHere, if a stranger bothers my wife or sister as he stares at them on their way home, I cannot tolerate that; I would have to kill him, or else I am not called a man in my community\u2026 .\u201d\n\nIn recent years, political science research has increasingly suggested a correlation between gender equality and a number of indicators of stability and prosperity: GDP per capita, growth rates, and low corruption. Political scientist Mary Caprioli, to cite just one example, has found that increased political, economic, and social gender equality makes states less likely to resort to military options in international conflicts and crises, and less likely to experience civil conflict. There\u2019s also more specific evidence that regressive gender norms and expectations around masculinity play into terrorist recruitment: Nearly all of the former jihadi fighters interviewed in a 2015 Mercy Corps study cited a common justification for their decision to travel to Jordan and Syria to fight\u2014protecting Sunni women and children. \u201cThose men who went to fight, those are real men,\u201d one young man in Ma\u2019an told researchers.\n\nA vendor waits for customers at a livestock market. (Noorullah Shirzada/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSome researchers have found that young men have more open and flexible attitudes about gender equality and masculinity until they reach puberty. In Afghanistan around that age, young men \u201cbegin to understand that they are never going to be accepted unless they marry and become head of a household,\u201d Texas A&M University Professor Valerie Hudson told me. \u201cThat means they will have to come up with a bride price, which may be the equivalent of several years\u2019 income, in addition to the cost of the wedding itself, which may involve up to 1000 guests.\u201d Hudson\u2019s research suggests that bride price \u201cis a catalyst for conflict and instability\u201d; rising prices make it harder for men who are un- or underemployed to come up with the money to pay for a bride, and more likely that they\u2019ll turn to an extremist group that promises them either money or brides in exchange for service. Unraveling \u201cthe web of incentives and disincentives that men are given in Afghan culture,\u201d she said, is key to understanding the patterns behind instability and extremist recruitment in the region.\n\nDespite the relevance of gender inequality for U.S. security policy and strategy in Afghanistan, prioritizing gender norms in the military\u2019s strategy to stabilize the area isn\u2019t as simple as it might seem. Masculinity, anywhere, is a difficult subject. \u201cWe\u2019ve floated talking about masculinity in the military,\u201d one female naval commander told me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t go over very well. People get defensive pretty much immediately, and make it personal and visceral. It\u2019s part of their identity.\u201d That makes it difficult, she said, to address strategic blindspots and approach problems like violent extremism or conflict reconstruction holistically: \u201cIf we aren\u2019t having those conversations, especially when you\u2019re talking about dealing with male-dominated organizations, like militaries, police sectors and government, we open ourselves up to missing things,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the countering violent extremism fight, what it means to be a man is a lot of times directly related to women. When terrorists use women and rape as a weapon of war, there is a reverberation and impact on men in society\u2014the men who weren\u2019t able to protect those women, and who have to resort to violence to feel like real men. That needs to be explored to really understand the problem and begin to address solutions to the instability.\u201d\n\nSome women, too, hesitate to integrate discussions of masculinity into U.S. foreign policy and programming, fearing it could overshadow or detract from the conversation about the needs and experiences of women and girls. \u201cThere\u2019s a philosophical tension there,\u201d said Jamille Bigio, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who previously worked on the White House National Security Council staff. Even in countries that are progressive when it comes to feminist foreign policy, like Canada and Sweden, the idea has been to talk more about women and girls\u2019 needs, rather than \u201cfeminist principles, which are different. Integrating feminist principles would start a different conversation about gender norms and gender roles,\u201d one that would systematically include men, she told me."

    "text": "Christine and Alex are both artists, and that in the end is their relationship\u2019s fatal flaw. Christine, because she is a woman, is able to love Alex, create art, and appreciate Alex\u2019s work all at once. But Hadley shows us in a conversation between the husbands that Alex is not as generous. Alex is stuck, unable to write. Zachary wonders, consoling him, whether he feels an \u201cinhibition\u201d because men live \u201cin the aftermath, with nothing left to say.\u201d Zachary himself has pondered whether \u201cwomen have been exempted from certain forms of self-doubt, which might be gendered.\u201d\n\n\u201cGendered?\u201d Alex does not know what he means. But Zachary has struck upon a truth. \u201cNow that women have picked up the pen\u2014for writing, for painting, for everything,\u201d he says, \u201cthey may feel all kinds of doubt but not that one. Because they\u2019re not belated. As women they\u2019re still near the beginning.\u201d Still, Alex does not get it, thinks it\u2019s a political pose. But Zachary goes on, describing Christine\u2019s work, of which he is a fan. \u201cHow has she been able to make her art so freely? It\u2019s poured out of her, hasn\u2019t it? Why hasn\u2019t she felt the heavy hand on her shoulder?\u201d With a shock, Zachary sees on his friend\u2019s face that he has never taken his wife seriously, is startled \u201cto have Christine\u2019s work invoked in the same scale as anything he, Alex, might have done.\u201d\n\nAnd so Alex is, in the end, no artist at all; he cannot see quality when it is in front of him. Lydia is no artist either, only a connoisseur of men. So, after Zachary\u2019s death, the inevitable happens. Without him, there is nobody left to be Christine\u2019s audience, and so she cannot create. Without being seen, she cannot love; without love, there is no marriage. On the other side of divorce, at long last, Christine realizes that the key to her study is still within her reach.\n\nFiction about women in midlife is sometimes marketed insultingly. Barnes & Noble has a section on its website called \u201cWomen of a Certain Age,\u201d and it\u2019s full of Danielle Steele pulp and books like The Hot Flash Club. But Late in the Day joins a tradition of literature about women who, later in life, realize that they have trapped themselves in bourgeois prisons of their own making, and break free.\n\nThese books range from the cheeky fun of Colette\u2019s Break of Day (1928) to Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s pompous but elegant Force of Circumstance (1963), a book full of derisive portraits of men still desperate to find themselves, while she sits pretty in her hard-won self-awareness. More recently, readers have met women brutalized by time into a radical intelligence in Jennifer Egan\u2019s A Visit from the Goon Squad and Jane Alison\u2019s Nine Island.\n\nIn 1988, Carolyn G. Heilbrun wrote in The New York Times that it \u201cis perhaps only in old age, certainly past 50, that women can stop being female impersonators, can grasp the opportunity to reverse their most cherished principles of \u2018femininity.\u2019\u201d Here I do not think that Heilbrun means prettiness or sexuality. Instead she is writing of women\u2019s approaches to the project of their own lives. While impersonating the idea of a woman, a person cannot survive the end of youth. But self-actualized women over 50, she writes, \u201cdiffer from men, who if they need discover new courage, need not profoundly change their lives, need not dedicate them to something new, only perhaps more intensely to their old ambitions.\u201d For women, new insight into one\u2019s creative powers in later life requires a wrench, a rejection\u2014even an abnegation of old responsibilities.\n\nIf Heilbrun is right, and older women must face down this crisis in a way that men do not, then it is a wonder that we do not read more great novels about post-menopausal artistic revelations. There is much in Hadley\u2019s novel to distract you from its core discussion on gender and art: Christine is preoccupied by her duties as a mother, as the person who buys flowers and cooks pasta. And so she distracts us in turn, disguising her abilities as an artist from the reader.\n\nWhy did I witness all those divorces with such terror, as a child? I feared for my home, I suppose, but mostly for myself. If I had picked out these interesting women as role models, and then they had been discarded so easily, then my own life seemed fated to turn out the same way. But no style of living is compulsory, Tessa Hadley teaches. There is always a choice, even when somebody else chooses for you. For any reader interested in the relationship between romantic love and the creative life, Late in the Day unfurls into a tale both cautionary and motivating. The novel\u2019s end is its heroine\u2019s beginning; the sequel is there to be lived."

    "authors": [
      "Elliot Haspel"
    ],
    "text": "There\u2019s no doubt that universal pre-K, implemented well, helps the children who attend. This was recently reaffirmed by the largest study of pre-K to date, which found that a quality pre-K program substantially boosts the likelihood of attendees ending up with a college degree. It is far better than doing nothing at all, and there\u2019s a place for pre-K in the early childhood landscape. There is, however, a key question of opportunity cost. Pouring tens of millions of dollars into universal pre-K leaves a pittance for more effective family-support programs.\n\nBecause development in the earliest months and years are so inextricably relationship-based, there is no \u201cone best system\u201d for early care. Between half and two-thirds of young American children\u2014who number in the tens of millions\u2014need outside care because their parents are in the workforce. These parents may have a strong preference for a caregiver who is related to them or who speaks their language, or they may want a smaller home-based care, or they may desire a Montessori experience, and so on. Right now, due to a lack of affordable, available, quality care, most don\u2019t even a choice at all; two-thirds of parents report having \u201conly one\u201d or \u201cjust a few\u201d viable care options.\n\n\n\nThe solutions are myriad, and not mutually exclusive. Perhaps we should pay stay-at-home-parents their long-deserved due. I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s time to make child care a common, free good by providing a voucher to cover all costs. A generous child allowance, longer paid family leave, tripling the child tax credit, boosting the EITC\u2014there are no shortage of options. All of them move towards what Grover J. \u201cRuss\u201d Whitehurst, a former Department of Education official who first framed the family support vs. school readiness tension, suggests as the goal of family support policies: providing \u201cthe best possible conditions for families with children.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s broad support for this idea. A recently released poll by the First Five Years Fund found that more than 80 percent of Americans\u2014including over 60 percent of Republicans, 80 percent of independents, and 90 percent of Democrats\u2014support ideas like increasing the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit or increasing funding to help provide affordable child care for working parents.* It\u2019s even more popular than universal pre-K.\n\nThe current state of affairs isn\u2019t sustainable. American day care is on life support thanks to tapped-out parents and a lack of public investment. The future of America quite literally depends on implementing the right early-childhood policies, as new CDC data confirmed once more that our birth rate has plummeted below the replacement rate. Two major reasons for that are the absurd costs of child-rearing and the lack of family support.\n\n\n\nUniversal pre-K comes from a good place. It\u2019s a recognition that early education matters, and that children from historically disadvantaged backgrounds have the least access to formal care settings. But a universal family support policy would accomplish so much more per dollar, and can address the problem at its roots. Give struggling parents the financial means to do what is best for their children, and it will help to relieve the stress that has burdened American families\u2014and held back millions of kids\u2014for far too long.\n\n\n\n*A previous version of this article misstated the tax credit about which the First Five Years Fund polled."

      "Emily Atkin"
    ],
    "text": "During the shutdown, Kanta has kept busy by speaking to her family on WhatsApp\u2014her daughter lives in India, and her son in Canada\u2014and checking up on other SEE enrollees. \u201cI try to call all of them to talk to them,\u201d Kanta said. \u201cThey\u2019re very upset.\u201d But now that she\u2019s alone all the time, she finds herself plagued with worry about what might happen if something happened to her. What if she were to experience a medical emergency? Who would be there to help her?\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the problem of the vanishing paychecks. \u201cI need money,\u201d Kanta said. \u201cHow can you just do without it?\u201d Unlike the federal employees that Kanta sits next to, she and the other SEE enrollees likely won\u2019t ever get paid for this lost time. \u201cI went through 2 shutdowns during Obama administration but they were much shorter,\u201d Enck said. \u201cThe SEE employees did not get retroactive pay.\u201d\n\nFor Kanta, this means fresh food is nearly out of the question. She\u2019s been cooking mostly dried lentils and rice. Last week, she received a $20 donation from a friend. \u201cI was thinking of going to buy some bananas,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother SEE enrollee, an administrative assistant in D.C. who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution at work, has more of a financial cushion than Kanta because her husband has a full-time job. But the loss of her $2,200 monthly wages means her family is \u201cunable to buy the groceries we would normally buy, or put gas in our car.\u201d Last week, she said, she started crying in a 7-Eleven after getting a notification that her checking account was overdrawn. \u201cI had to transfer money in from my savings, and it just, emotionally, it all hit me,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening to SEE enrollees is happening to millions of other people across the country. \u201cThe federal government is effectively the nation\u2019s largest employer of low-wage workers,\u201d David Dayen pointed out in The New Republic this month. \u201cIt funds 4.5 million contractor jobs that pay less than $15 an hour...\u201d That\u2019s millions of workers who might have to chalk January up as a loss, unless Senate Democrats and protesters are able to convince the Republicans to promise back pay for contractors, as Congress has already done for federal employees.\n\nSEE program enrollees aren\u2019t the only low-income seniors negatively affected by the shutdown. Housing assistance, food assistance, and public transportation assistance programs for the elderly have been scaled back, if not halted altogether. And if the shutdown drags on much longer, the Department of Agriculture may run out of money for the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, which serves approximately 4.8 million people over the age of 60.\n\nThe treatment of SEE enrollees reveals a distressing truth about how America values its older population, says the D.C.-based administrative assistant. When the government eventually reopens, and she returns to the office, all the younger people around her will receive a check for thousands of dollars. But she probably won\u2019t get a penny. \u201cWe\u2019re just like federal employees,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do the same work. But they\u2019re not talking about that. It\u2019s like we\u2019re nothing.\u201d"

      "Alexander Sammon"
    ],
    "text": "Nearly 100 speakers commented publicly; only four were in favor. Amid tears and a chorus of boos, the committee voted 3-to-1 to approve the new facility. If the people of Elwood wanted to save themselves and their town, they would have to fight for it.\n\nIn Elwood, geography is destiny. For homesteaders and farmers heading west in the 19th century, the flat terrain and quality soil made the region a major draw. \u201cThis area is kind of like a fertile crescent,\u201d said Baum-Coldwater, whose 540-acre farm has been worked by her family for 160 years and counting. The Coldwaters are one of many multi-generational farming families in the area, producing soybean seeds, primarily, as well as corn and oats. From the front porch, they can still see the original residence Julie\u2019s husband\u2019s great-great-grandfather built in 1858, as well as the houses his grandmother and grandfather each grew up in, before they married.\n\nEven the most thorough tour of Elwood doesn\u2019t last long. The town\u2019s nucleus sits on the west side of a highway, where a small strip mall, home to Silver Dollar restaurant and the Dollar Tree, leads to a handful of municipal buildings and a few blocks of housing. That denser development quickly gives way to a broad campestral swath, with the occasional farmhouse identifiable only because the area is so flat.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t topsoil that caught the eye of industry\u2014it was Elwood\u2019s serendipitous proximity to the country\u2019s major infrastructure. Six class-1 railroads and four interstate highways pass through the region, which is situated a day\u2019s drive from a full 60 percent of the country. Chicago is some 40 miles northeast as the crow flies.\n\nFor much of the 20th century, Elwood sat in the shadow of the Joliet Arsenal, an Army facility built in 1940 that churned out bombs and TNT to feed the American war machine from World War II through the Cold War. But once the Vietnam War ended, its utility subsided. In 1976, the facility was shuttered.\n\nWhat to do with 23,500 idle acres became the subject of great debate. Mining and asphalt plants were suggested; a coal-fired power plant was proposed; so, too, was a new landfill. The passage of the Illinois Land Conservation Act in 1996 enshrined a solution. Nineteen thousand acres were converted into protected prairie land, where 73 head of bison currently roam. The Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery, the country\u2019s second-largest military cemetery, was also established. That left 2,000-odd remaining acres, officially a Superfund site, too spoiled to farm. This remaining tract was zoned for light industry. For Jerry and Connie Heinrich, who headed up the effort to preserve the region\u2019s prairies, it was the best of all possible outcomes, considering the alternatives. \u201cThe Greens were excited,\u201d Jerry told me.\n\nA staggering $623 billion worth of freight traversed Will County infrastructure in 2015 alone, roughly equivalent to 3.5 percent of the U.S.\u2019s total GDP.\n\nSoon after, CenterPoint came through with its proposal for the Intermodal. The deal sounded good. CenterPoint, which is now owned by CalPers, the California public sector pension group, bought the land for an undisclosed amount. In addition to the tax abatement, Elwood, then shy of 1,700 people in total, agreed to build out a big-league water and sewer system for the facility, and extend municipal fire and police protection. In anticipation of the population and economic growth to come, they even built a new town hall, a tan, multi-story structure complete with a backyard pond and a fountain, referred to playfully as the Taj Ma-hall.\n\nWhen the facility opened in 2002, it was centered around the Burlington North Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad, which subsequently bought the loading zone. Warehouses were constructed nearby. The plan proved to be an immediate success: An ambitious forecast claimed that within eight to ten years the facility would see 500,000 containers annually; that threshold was surpassed in four.\n\nThat was enough to attract the eye of a notable investor: Warren Buffett, who made a pilgrimage to little Elwood in the late 2000s to survey the facility. According to one version of local legend, Buffett took in the scene of BNSF trains unloading containers onto trucks, and the trucks casting off into all corners of the United States, and declared, \u201cThis is the future of logistics.\u201d On November 3, 2009, Buffett bought BNSF in its entirety\u2014and with it, the Intermodal.\n\nAfter that, it was on. The success of the BNSF Intermodal, no doubt aided by the star power of Buffett, inspired railroad rival Union Pacific to set up a smaller, copycat facility across the street. The country\u2019s richest families moved in, at least in name. In addition to two Wal-Mart warehouses, each between 1.6 million and 1.8 million square feet, Elwood got a Walton Drive, named after the Walton dynasty that owns the big-box chain.\n\nFor Delilah Legrett, a lifelong resident of the area and mother of four, the drawbacks came quickly\u2014starting with all the trucks. Property values were supposed to skyrocket, but Legrett didn\u2019t even feel comfortable letting her children play in front of their house with the semis hurtling through the town, sometimes as fast as 40 or 50 miles per hour. With toddlers, the persistent diesel exhaust was concerning. \u201cWe had problems with our baby monitor because it would pick up frequencies\u201d from passing truck radios and warehouse dispatchers, she told me.\n\nAccording to the Will County Center for Economic Development, at least 25,000 tractor trailers a day come through the Intermodals. That amounts to three million containers annually, carrying $65 billion worth of goods. A staggering $623 billion worth of freight traversed Will County infrastructure in 2015 alone, roughly equivalent to 3.5 percent of the U.S.\u2019s total GDP.\n\n\u201cWhen I started, all these roads were dirt,\u201d says Paul Buss, the 77-year-old highway commissioner of Jackson Township.\n\nFor Paul Buss, the 77-year-old highway commissioner of Jackson Township, the unincorporated land that sits to Elwood\u2019s north, the trucks unleashed the chaos of the global supply chain on what was once a provincial post. \u201cWhen I started, all these roads were dirt,\u201d he told me as we drove around in his raised red Ford pickup. Once, a few slow tractors on the highway constituted a traffic jam. Now, the nearby interstates\u2014the I-80 and the I-55\u2014are swollen with semis at all hours of the day, while cataracts of trucks have spilled onto local highways and country roads. Potholes abound, and serpentine traffic jams have roiled residents. Trucks have backed over gravestones at the local cemetery after taking wrong turns. In 2016, a train derailed and hit a semi, throwing debris across the grounds of an elementary school, which was subsequently shuttered permanently for safety reasons. On the day I arrived, there were three accidents alone on I-80.\n\nThe trucks unleashed the chaos of the global supply chain on what was once a provincial post.\n\nThe inconvenience of a gridlocked infrastructure pales in comparison to the horror of increasingly commonplace traffic fatalities. In recent years, a pregnant mother was killed on I-80, and an eight-year-old girl was killed off highway 53. In 2014, a truck driver fell asleep at the wheel and killed five people on I-55. After a fatal accident outside the two newest Amazon fulfillment centers, cops had to take over traffic control during the afternoon shift change. \u201cYou think it would be a big news story,\u201d said Legrett, \u201cbut it happens all of the time.\u201d\n\nBuss is responsible for the country and local roads around highway 53, a ribbon of four narrow lanes that connects the interstates with Elwood. Sometimes all four lanes will be occupied by baby blue Amazon trailers featuring the company\u2019s signature curved arrow, four immense white smiles all in momentary alignment. The facilities run 24 hours a day, and the three shift changes\u2014morning, afternoon, and just before midnight\u2014are particularly harried. Backups of hundreds of cars and semis are frequent. Municipalities have struggled to maintain the roads\u2014one stretch of 53 was repaved three times last summer alone.\n\nThe turmoil has only been exacerbated by changes in the trucking industry, which has pivoted to an owner-operator model, relying on independent contractors over full-time employees. Oftentimes, truckers are paid per load\u2014$50 to $70 to pick up a container from the Intermodal and drop it off at a warehouse. For independent contractors, responsible for their own gas and operating costs, speed is tantamount to profitability. A traffic jam can turn the trip from profit to loss. So truckers often take shortcuts down small residential roads, unequipped for weight and traffic, to shave valuable minutes off their commute. Sometimes they\u2019ll get stuck in narrow intersections. \u201cNo Trucks\u201d signs are ubiquitous, but they\u2019ve been of little use as deterrents.\n\nA map of Elwood and its environs: 1) The Centerpoint Intermodal freight terminal, operated by BSNF; 2) the Union Pacific Global IV Intermodal; 3) a proposed warehouse facility, whose size and location are based on leaked projections; 4) the town of Elwood proper; 5) warehouses. Map by Siung Tjia\n\n\u201cTruckers are different than they used to be,\u201d Buss told me. \u201cThey\u2019re just some guy off the street who bought some junk truck.\u201d Later, we spotted a semi heading into a residential neighborhood, surging past \u201cNo Trucks\u201d warnings. Buss flipped his lights on and sped to overtake the truck, swinging his pickup in front of it to bring it to a stop. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a problem trying to get him out of here,\u201d Buss grumbled. \u201cThere\u2019s no training now. Most of these guys don\u2019t know how to back up.\u201d\n\nSure enough, the escape proved challenging. As the driver pulled forward to line up a three-point turn, the truck teetered dangerously on the edge of the road. Buss had to get out and wave the driver through the process. Ten minutes later, the truck finally made its exit. \u201cIt\u2019s like this every day,\u201d Buss said. \u201cEvery day.\u201d\n\nThe only thing more common in Will County than the \u201cNo Trucks\u201d signs are the hiring notices from temp agencies. The county is home to 99 in all\u2014one of the highest concentrations of staffing agencies in the country. They share lofty, aspirational monikers, like Paramount, Accurate, and Elite. Amazon has its own preferred staffing agency: Integrity.\n\nTemp agencies existed before the Intermodal came along\u2014they played a crucial role in breaking the union stranglehold on labor in the Joliet Caterpillar plant. But the arrival of the logistics industry created a whole new market for temporary work. On the day I arrived, my hotel in Joliet was hosting a job fair for a staffing company called Geodis, which was looking for seasonal workers to help box Legos. After I inquired, they told me they\u2019d be willing to hire me on the spot and start me on Monday, provided I could lift 50 pounds. They asked me to sign a 90-day contract, \u201ctemp-to-hire,\u201d after which I\u2019d be evaluated for a potential full-time role.\n\nAntonio Suarez drove 45 minutes from the suburbs of Chicago for the opportunity to interview with Geodis. He was hired right away. \u201cIt seems too good to be true,\u201d he joked nervously. Suarez told me he was expecting to work 30 hours a week for Geodis, which would complement the 30 hours he was working as a special needs caregiver. He also worked part time for his mom\u2019s catering company, and was on his way to yet another gig delivering pizzas. He expected he would soon be brought on full-time by Geodis."

    "text": "Trump\u2019s hotel is well-situated in the capital, so it\u2019s not surprising that inaugural events would be held there. (For similar reasons, it\u2019s also not surprising that top executives would opt to stay there.) But the optics are troubling at best. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee raked in more than $100 million from corporate and individual donors, a far higher sum than similar committees operated by George W. Bush and Barack Obama. By spending those funds at Trump\u2019s properties, the inaugural committee effectively transfers those donors\u2019 contributions directly into the Trump Organization\u2019s coffers. And since Trump hasn\u2019t fully divested himself of his business holdings, as ethics officials recommended before his inauguration, those profits eventually flow into the pockets of the president and his adult children.\n\nWhat have donors received in return? Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, a Republican mega-donor and the committee\u2019s largest individual contributor, gave more than $5 million. He happens to enjoy a close relationship with the president. Adelson and his wife joined Trump at a small private gathering last November to watch the results of the 2018 midterms. The Trump era has also been a fruitful one for Adelson. The Las Vegas billionaire lobbied in favor of the president\u2019s decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem in 2017, reversing decades of U.S. foreign policy on the matter. And earlier this week, the Justice Department reversed an Obama-era legal opinion in declaring that federal law bans all forms of internet gambling, which Adelson strenuously opposes as a potential threat to his casino empire.\n\nAdelson, like any other American, has the right to donate to political campaigns and committees and lobby elected officials. Foreign governments enjoy no such privileges, however. That distinction makes the overseas cash flows into the Trump Organization all the more alarming. Last month, the Post reported that a lobbyist for Saudi Arabia\u2019s monarchy spent more than $270,000 for rooms at Trump\u2019s hotel shortly after his election as president. Those rooms housed dozens of U.S. veterans who were then brought to Capitol Hill to lobby against a law that would open the door to lawsuits against the Saudi government for the September 11th attacks.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only time that foreign powers have done business on Trump properties, either. The Times identified stays at the president\u2019s hotels by the Malaysian prime minister and his staff, as well as by the Republic of Georgia\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations. Romania\u2019s consulate in Chicago also rented space at Trump\u2019s hotel in that city for an event last November. Both the foreign governments and the Trump administration have denied any wrongdoing or impropriety; the Trump Organization has also paid six-figure sums to the Treasury to offset any foreign expenditures to it. The company hasn\u2019t been forthcoming about tabulating the precise sources of these profits, however. And it\u2019s unclear whether this is enough to avoid violating the Constitution\u2019s ban on foreign incomes to federal public officials.\n\nTrump no longer maintains day-to-day control over his business empire. Some of his actions may have nonetheless favored his plum real-estate property in the capital. Last year, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee accused the president of improperly intervening in the search for a new FBI headquarters. The bureau\u2019s current headquarters, the J. Edgar Hoover Building, is a crumbling Brutalist scar on Pennsylvania Avenue. One plan would have transferred its staff and operations to a new headquarters in the suburbs and sold the coveted property to a private developer. Democrats alleged that Trump intervened to keep the bureau at its current location, thereby preventing another hotel from being built just a few steps from his own."

Tuesday\u2019s hearing was the first of what looks to be his signature investigation, an analogue to Henry Waxman\u2019s investigation of the tobacco industry when he ran the Oversight Committee in the 1990s. It\u2019s a reminder to Democrats of the importance of overseeing more than just the Trump administration\u2014of the power of Congress not just to check the president, but make a difference in people\u2019s lives.\n\nHealth care was the top issue in the midterm elections, making drug company price-gouging a natural subject of inquiry. Prescription drug prices are expected to go up to $610 billion by 2021, and for every price that gets cut, another 96 increase. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services projects prescription drug spending as a primary driver of overall health care inflation.\n\nInnovation, in the form of new advances in medicine, is not the cause of this steady price rise. It mostly comes from existing medications. Insulin, for instance, is a 100-year-old drug that companies have \u201cevergreened\u201d through incremental changes to the makeup of the drug, which resets the 20-year patent clock. Insulin costs per patient doubled from 2012 to 2016, and at the beginning of the year, Sanofi and Novo Nordisk raised their insulin prices again.\n\nCummings\u2019s Oversight Committee is taking on the industry in a systematic fashion. Two weeks ago, he sent letters to twelve major drug companies, asking for internal communications about price increases and preserving market share, as well as estimates of investment in research and development. Repeatedly in the hearing, Democrats made the point that pharmaceutical companies spend more on advertising than researching new drugs.\n\nThe hearing featured several researchers and experts on the drug supply chain, as well as Worsham. Future ones will undoubtedly include CEOs of the leading drug companies, contrasting the personal stories of dying patients with the cold financial calculus of Big Pharma executives. Maybe Cummings will end up with a picture as famous as the shot of the tobacco CEOs with their hands raised, testifying under oath that they had no idea their product was addictive."

    "text": "Mill\u2019s concept of harm is notoriously slippery: It\u2019s not necessarily clear how the Liberty principle would apply in cleaning up Facebook. Mill probably wouldn\u2019t have much objection to Facebook\u2019s attention-hijacking maneuvers, for instance. It\u2019s your choice how you procrastinate, and as long as you\u2019re not harming others in the process, the government shouldn\u2019t patronize you by micromanaging. When it comes to privacy, again Mill might have argued that by agreeing to the terms and conditions, one voluntarily consents to giving Facebook access to some private data. But grabbing and holding attention for as long as possible, while mining data users may not fully be aware they\u2019re giving for more effective ad targeting? The voluntary nature of data sharing there is questionable.\n\nComplicating matters further, Mill encouraged states to protect people\u2019s rights\u2014such as the contemporary right to privacy some legal frameworks now recognize. But what counts as a right, according to Mill, is specifically something without which human happiness cannot be maximized. We can\u2019t be sure whether data privacy would have been the kind of thing Mill would have thought necessary for maximizing happiness.\n\nWhen it comes to the 2016 election-related scandals, there are two separate issues: The dissemination of fake news stories with the aim to spread confusion and short-circuit the democratic process, and the use of data by third parties, such as Cambridge Analytica, with the aim to influence voters in very personalized ways.\n\nMill wouldn\u2019t have seen the spreading of fake news as problematic.\n\nMill wouldn\u2019t have seen the spreading of fake news as problematic. When discussing freedom of speech, Mill argued that not only are false views not damaging, they are actually beneficial. Encountering and combating false views helps prevent the truth from becoming \u201cdead dogma,\u201d Mill wrote: Truth would constantly need defending and reaffirming. Mill seemed to believe that an open, free debate meant the truth would usually prevail, whereas under censorship, truth could end up being accidentally suppressed, along with falsehood. It\u2019s a view that seems a bit archaic in the age of an online marketplace of memes and clickbait, where false stories tend to spread faster and wider than their true counterpoints.\n\nBut Mill did also believe that some cases called for the limiting of the freedom of expression. When it is highly likely that one\u2019s remarks will lead to the physical harm of others, then you can be punished for them by the state. The enabling and dissemination of inflammatory content believed to have contributed to the genocide of the Rohingya in Myanmar would very much fall under that category: In a series of posts going back years, The New York Times reported last fall, military personnel in Myanmar \u201cturned the social network into a tool for ethnic cleansing,\u201d taking advantage of the platform\u2019s ubiquity to spread propaganda vilifying the county\u2019s minority Muslim group, who were then repeatedly massacred."

And I do believe I\u2019m a victim of that, honestly.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump then tries to pivot to his accomplishments with China, Sulzberger steers the discussion back toward the broader fallout of Trump\u2019s attacks, even for journalists that don\u2019t cover him at all. \u201cWould you say more so now than over the last five years?\u201d Trump asks. Yes, Sulzberger replies. \u201cRight now?\u201d the president asks. \u201cI mean, more so now than even a year ago?\u201d Yes, the Times\u2019 publisher confirms. \u201cI\u2019m not happy to hear that,\u201d Trump declares. He soon reverts to his grievances against \u201cinaccurate reporting.\u201d\n\nTrump later defends himself by insisting he\u2019s not alone in his critique of the Times. \u201cI know what you\u2019re all saying,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut everybody thinks The New York Times treats me terribly. Washington Post also.\u201d When the meeting wraps up, Trump tries to end on an upbeat and unbelievable note. \u201cI mean, you know, anyway I agree with you 100 percent, and I\u2019m honored to have spent the time with you, and I\u2019d like you to call me, and I\u2019m going to work on that so hard you have no idea,\u201d he told the Times\u2019 team. \u201cCause I think you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019d be nice to think that the president meant that. But past experience suggests otherwise. Delegitimizing media outlets is too valuable a tactic for him to give up so easily. In a tweet last May, Trump effectively admitted that he uses \u201cfake news\u201d as a general term to describe negative coverage of his administration. It works, too: A poll earlier that spring found that 89 percent of Republicans think major news outlets spread fake news. Trump\u2019s slim road to reelection depends on holding together his base, which means he needs to inoculate as many of them as possible from the whirlwind of bad news that surrounds him.\n\nEven if the president gained no strategic advantage from his attacks on the press, there\u2019s no reason to believe he\u2019d ever relent. This has nothing to do with his prodigious talent for lying and fabulism. It\u2019s that he is often unable to stick to any particular stance, especially when pressed on it in person. Even his own party struggles with his mercurial nature. Last January, they scrambled to remind Trump that he opposed a clean DACA vote after California Senator Dianne Feinstein pressed him to support it on national television. Pressure from conservative commentators over border wall funding last December led Trump to renege on congressional Republicans and force a self-destructive government shutdown."

    "text": "It\u2019s hard to argue that, at this moment in time, Brexit is worse for Britain than Trump is for America. But it\u2019s also easy to see how, half a decade from now, that will be true. And if that\u2019s so, it will be largely attributable to fundamental differences between the countries themselves.\n\nThe Founding Fathers built the American system of government with someone like Trump in mind: a corrupt demagogue who shows no interest in protecting minority rights or upholding the rule of law. Federal judges throughout the lower courts have blocked his administration\u2019s legally dubious policies from going into effect. American voters last fall handed Democrats control of House of Representatives to act as a check on the president. Impeachment threats appear to have blocked him from shutting down the Russia investigation. The damage would have been further minimized if Congress hadn\u2019t ceded so much of its power to the executive branch in recent decades.\n\n\n\nThings are much different across the Atlantic. Instead of an American-style constitution, the United Kingdom relies on an unwritten body of precedents and traditions to shape its political system. In practical terms, this means Parliament reigns supreme. Though Britain\u2019s judiciary is independent, judges can\u2019t overturn laws passed by the legislature, like their American counterparts can. The British monarch\u2019s executive powers are now exercised by the prime minister and members of his Cabinet, all of whom are also lawmakers themselves.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution determines what Congress can make laws about and what matters are left to the states. Parliament, on the other hand, has \u201csovereign and uncontrollable authority in making, confirming, enlarging, restraining, abrogating, repealing, reviving, and expounding of laws, concerning matters of all possible denominations, ecclesiastical, or temporal, civil, military, maritime, or criminal,\u201d Lord Blackstone, Britain\u2019s most celebrated jurist, wrote in the eighteenth century. \u201cIt can, in short, do everything that is not naturally impossible.\u201d\n\nEverything, that is, except forge a transitional agreement to leave the European Union. May\u2019s Conservative Party is torn between Brexit hardliners who demand a departure from the bloc at all costs and a range of other Tory factions that want something less destructive. Last year, she called a snap general election in hopes of securing a mandate to negotiate an agreement on Britain\u2019s behalf. Instead, her party lost seats and became dependent on support from Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party to stay in power. The DUP\u2019s influence has made it harder to reach a consensus on the Irish border, which is supposed to stay open under the Good Friday Agreement but likely will close if Britain crashes out of the EU."

    "text": "In recent interviews, Schultz has struggled to articulate a political vision outside of his singular obsession. He considers the $21 trillion national debt an existential threat to the nation, and blames both parties for it: Under Trump, Republicans have wasted a strong economy by passing a debt-ballooning $1.5 trillion tax cut, while Democrats are proposing costly and irresponsible policies like a Green New Deal and Medicare for All.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo those who say an independent run would help ensure the re-election of Donald Trump, I say the two parties\u2019 inability to come together to serve the people has created the opportunity for a centrist independent to be successful,\u201d he wrote in a USA Today op-ed on Tuesday. On The View, he explained why he couldn\u2019t run as a Democrat. \u201cWatch every Democrat go to [early primary states like New Hampshire and Iowa] and have to be disingenuous and probably make a false promise \u2026 just to be able to get elected in the primary in those states,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order to run as a Democrat today, you have to fall in line with free Medicare for everybody, free college for everybody, a free job for everybody.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis reference to \u201ca free job\u201d\u2014an apparent reference to proposals for a job guarantee\u2014is revealing. For Schultz, the most important thing to deliver for people is the dignity of work. \u201cI fiercely believe that Starbucks\u2019 attempts to be a different kind of company\u2014one that my own father, a working class laborer, never had a chance to work for\u2014are worth sharing at this fragile yet auspicious moment in our country\u2019s history, when truth and dignity need to make a thunderous comeback,\u201d he writes in the book\u2019s preface. Looking back at his childhood, Schultz doesn\u2019t see missing social programs that could have helped unskilled laborers like his father; he sees missing companies like Starbucks that could have given him an identity.\n\n\n\nIt was the humiliation of shooing away debt collectors and begging for money that drove Schultz, who is among the 400 richest people in America, to provide benefits for his employees. In From the Ground Up, like his earlier memoirs, Schultz proudly notes that Starbucks was the first company to offer both health insurance and stock options to its employees. In Schultz\u2019s telling, the benevolence of corporations and a public commitment to the dignity of work can cure everything that ails America. This combination, in Schultz\u2019s view, can not only lift people out of poverty, but help solve the country\u2019s most complex and intractable problems, like racism\u2014a line of thought that led to Starbucks\u2019s disastrous Race Together campaign. Schultz is now making the case that the same approach could work politically: that the government must unleash the brilliance of American corporations. For instance, he recently said he would ask \u201ctech companies\u201d to \u201csolve the problem of border security.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean Schultz sees no role for the government. He gives the game away in a section detailing his decision to sell the Seattle SuperSonics, the NBA franchise which then moved to Oklahoma City. Schultz blames the city for his decision to sell the team because it didn\u2019t give him hundreds of millions in public money, tax breaks, and other subsidies to build a new arena\u2014even though such taxpayer-funded handouts have been proven to have no positive effect on spurring economic growth. One gets the sense that Schultz believes the state exists to empower\u2014and enrich\u2014billionaires and corporations, who will then supposedly use that corporate welfare to solve problems like health care, infrastructure, and immigration. The problem is, that accurately describes the status quo in Washington today\u2014minus the problem-solving.\n\n"

    "text": "For many men, living up to that socially sanctioned definition amidst inexorable physical and economic insecurity is impossible.\n\nThe Promundo research, which included a nationally representative household survey of 1,000 male and 1,000 female participants, focus group discussions with both men and women, as well as other interviews with men, complements other findings that Afghani gender norms, which many thought the fall of the Taliban would improve, have resisted change: A 2016 Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit ( AREU) study showed Afghan men across generations believed men to be superior to women when it came to leadership qualities and levels of education and thought that men held the primary responsibility for the security of their families. More than half of young and more mature men thought wife-beating was acceptable. \u201cOur talks and discussions about women\u2019s rights are all as slogans but nothing in action,\u201d one AREU focus group participant told researchers. \u201cHere, if a stranger bothers my wife or sister as he stares at them on their way home, I cannot tolerate that; I would have to kill him, or else I am not called a man in my community\u2026 .\u201d\n\nIn recent years, political science research has increasingly suggested a correlation between gender equality and a number of indicators of stability and prosperity: GDP per capita, growth rates, and low corruption. Political scientist Mary Caprioli, to cite just one example, has found that increased political, economic, and social gender equality makes states less likely to resort to military options in international conflicts and crises, and less likely to experience civil conflict. There\u2019s also more specific evidence that regressive gender norms and expectations around masculinity play into terrorist recruitment: Nearly all of the former jihadi fighters interviewed in a 2015 Mercy Corps study cited a common justification for their decision to travel to Jordan and Syria to fight\u2014protecting Sunni women and children. \u201cThose men who went to fight, those are real men,\u201d one young man in Ma\u2019an told researchers.\n\nA vendor waits for customers at a livestock market. (Noorullah Shirzada/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSome researchers have found that young men have more open and flexible attitudes about gender equality and masculinity until they reach puberty. In Afghanistan around that age, young men \u201cbegin to understand that they are never going to be accepted unless they marry and become head of a household,\u201d Texas A&M University Professor Valerie Hudson told me. \u201cThat means they will have to come up with a bride price, which may be the equivalent of several years\u2019 income, in addition to the cost of the wedding itself, which may involve up to 1000 guests.\u201d Hudson\u2019s research suggests that bride price \u201cis a catalyst for conflict and instability\u201d; rising prices make it harder for men who are un- or underemployed to come up with the money to pay for a bride, and more likely that they\u2019ll turn to an extremist group that promises them either money or brides in exchange for service. Unraveling \u201cthe web of incentives and disincentives that men are given in Afghan culture,\u201d she said, is key to understanding the patterns behind instability and extremist recruitment in the region.\n\nDespite the relevance of gender inequality for U.S. security policy and strategy in Afghanistan, prioritizing gender norms in the military\u2019s strategy to stabilize the area isn\u2019t as simple as it might seem. Masculinity, anywhere, is a difficult subject. \u201cWe\u2019ve floated talking about masculinity in the military,\u201d one female naval commander told me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t go over very well. People get defensive pretty much immediately, and make it personal and visceral. It\u2019s part of their identity.\u201d That makes it difficult, she said, to address strategic blindspots and approach problems like violent extremism or conflict reconstruction holistically: \u201cIf we aren\u2019t having those conversations, especially when you\u2019re talking about dealing with male-dominated organizations, like militaries, police sectors and government, we open ourselves up to missing things,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the countering violent extremism fight, what it means to be a man is a lot of times directly related to women. When terrorists use women and rape as a weapon of war, there is a reverberation and impact on men in society\u2014the men who weren\u2019t able to protect those women, and who have to resort to violence to feel like real men. That needs to be explored to really understand the problem and begin to address solutions to the instability.\u201d\n\nSome women, too, hesitate to integrate discussions of masculinity into U.S. foreign policy and programming, fearing it could overshadow or detract from the conversation about the needs and experiences of women and girls. \u201cThere\u2019s a philosophical tension there,\u201d said Jamille Bigio, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who previously worked on the White House National Security Council staff. Even in countries that are progressive when it comes to feminist foreign policy, like Canada and Sweden, the idea has been to talk more about women and girls\u2019 needs, rather than \u201cfeminist principles, which are different. Integrating feminist principles would start a different conversation about gender norms and gender roles,\u201d one that would systematically include men, she told me."

According to polling from Civiqs, Pelosi\u2019s favorability has jumped 13 points among Democrats, from 59 to 72 percent. \u201cIt appears, then, that Pelosi\u2019s opposition to the president has rallied her party\u2019s base and increased her favorability ratings,\u201d argued The Washington Post\u2019s Michael Tesler. But it\u2019s not just Democrats who approve of her performance during the shutdown. As a CBS News poll released on Wednesday found, \u201cAmong Americans overall, and including independents, more want to see Mr. Trump give up wall funding than prefer the congressional Democrats agree to wall funding. Comparably more Americans feel House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is handling negotiations better than the president is so far.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are winning the shutdown thus far because they haven\u2019t compromised\u2014and they have no reason to do so, given the unpopularity of the president and the border wall. The length and severity of this shutdown, now the longest in U.S. history, could do lasting damage to Trump\u2019s presidency. If so, we may be witnessing the pinnacle of Pelosi\u2019s career. She had already proven herself as a resolute obstructionist when she thwarted George W. Bush\u2019s plan to privatize Social Security in 2005. In 2009 and 2010, she proved herself a master legislator when she passed Obamacare, which she helped resuscitate, and the (ultimately doomed) cap-and-trade bill. But given the stakes of the current political moment, the character of the president, and the criticism she has fielded over the past year, her recent performance against Trump will change the story that\u2019s told about her in history books.\n\nLooking ahead to 2020, progressives may yet have reason to be skeptical about Pelosi\u2019s continued hold on the gavel\u2014especially if Democrats win back both the presidency and the Senate. She has, especially recently, shown herself to be cautious when confronting the progressive wing\u2019s increasingly ambitious agenda. She implemented a pay-go rule in the House, requiring new spending to be offset by budget cuts or tax increases. On Medicare for All, she has largely advocated for strengthening Obamacare, but did recently allow hearings on universal health care to go forward. As for Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal, Pelosi does not seem to be a fan: Earlier this year, she rebuffed the freshman\u2019s attempt to form a committee on the proposal. Finally, while she has advocated for younger leaders, she has tended to privilege corporate-friendly centrists like Hakeem Jeffries over progressives like Barbara Lee.\n\n\n\nBut 2020 is a long way off, and Democrats\u2019 unified control of the government may be an even longer way off. For now, by undercutting and emasculating Trump at every turn, Pelosi is determined to turn the shutdown into the beginning of the end of his presidency. In doing so, she has earned the loyalty of her entire caucus. Winning tends to have that effect.\n\n"

    "text": "If there\u2019s anything that you might already know about the new Matthew McConaughey movie Serenity, it\u2019s that it contains a big twist. And if there\u2019s anything you know about the big critics\u2019 reviews, it\u2019s that they are negative and full of spoilers. The New Yorker\u2019s Richard Brody wrote in his pan that \u201c[t]here\u2019s almost nothing of consequence to discuss in Serenity that isn\u2019t a spoiler, but there\u2019s almost nothing in it that\u2019s not spoiled in advance.\u201d But if you like seeing authentically unusual movies, then ignore the haters: In its fusion of disparate genres, its sentimentality, and its weirdness, Serenity is actually worth watching. For a spoiler-free appreciation of this strange chunk of cinema, read on. I bet you can\u2019t guess the twist.\n\nWe begin with the flash of a fin underwater. Though at first it seems like this fish is a bit of scenery, it actually turns out to be a central character in the movie. Our rugged hero Baker Dill (McConaughey) is a fisherman living on the Floridian island of Plymouth, and he\u2019s obsessed with a tuna named Justice. He spars with his friend Duke (Djimon Hounsou) and everybody else in town who thinks he\u2019s crazy. \u201cI fish tuna,\u201d Baker says. \u201cYou fish one tuna, man,\u201d the villager replies. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the tuna in your head.\u201d\n\nBeneath the ripple of McConaughey\u2019s muscle and the bright sunshine that plays on the water, the ghost of Hemingway stirs. Perhaps his most famous story, Hemingway\u2019s The Old Man and the Sea told of an elderly Cuban fisherman who, much like Baker Dill, hunts an elusive marlin in the Gulf Stream. In that story, the fisherman battles as much with fate as with the fish. Like Baker, he confronts the sea\u2019s unknowability and frames its mystery in gendered terms: \u201cThe old man always thought of [the sea] as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favours, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought.\u201d According to Baker, the best way to catch tuna is by moonlight.\n\nBaker is fighting a lot of things, literally and allegorically. He fights with an inexplicable compulsion to catch \u201cJustice,\u201d an aptly named prize that eludes him. Who is keeping him from this fulfillment? At the movie\u2019s start, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s women (he sleeps with a strange woman named Constance (Diane Lane) for cash, for fishing hooks) or fortune itself (in Hemingway\u2019s story, the fisherman is cursed with salao, a Spanish word meaning both \u201csalty\u201d and \u201cvery bad luck\u201d)."

    "text": "Other conservatives soon joined the chorus, however. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, who also chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to FBI Director Chris Wray this week asking for more details about Stone\u2019s arrest. \u201cI am concerned about the manner in which the arrest was effectuated, especially the number of agents involved, the tactics employed, the timing of the arrest, and whether the FBI released details of the arrest and the indictment to the press prior to providing this information to Mr. Stone\u2019s attorneys,\u201d Graham wrote. Representative Doug Collins, the ranking Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee, sent a similar letter.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Stone\u2019s arrest was atypical\u2014in that it ranked pretty low on the spectrum of police militarization. The Washington Post\u2019s Radley Balko, who has more experience covering police use-of-force problems than just about anyone, had a more measured take on what Stone experienced. \u201cA dozen agents w/ guns out seems excessive,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t look like SWAT team. Wasn\u2019t a no-knock. No explosives. No dynamic entry. Maybe not ideal, but far better treatment than your average pot dealer.\u201d\n\nOther responses suggest that partisan concerns may be a greater factor here than genuine issues with law enforcement policy. Hannity, a fervent loyalist of President Trump, responded to the arrest with his usual partisan umbrage. Why, he asked, weren\u2019t obvious crooks like Hillary Clinton, former CIA Director John Brennan, or former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper facing the same treatment? \u201cWe are a democratic republic,\u201d he inveighed. \u201cThe Constitution that we cherish so much is the foundation of all law and order in this country. If you don\u2019t apply the laws equally, only going after one group of people because of their political views, and you protect people with other political views, you\u2019ve lost our Constitution. We\u2019ve lost our country.\u201d\n\nEven typically cooler heads on the right spoke up in Stone\u2019s defense. Napolitano, a Fox News legal analyst, is usually a voice of moderation in conservative circles when it comes to the Russia investigation. \u201cNo innocent American merits the governmental treatment Stone received,\u201d he wrote in an op-ed on Thursday. \u201cIt was the behavior of a police state where the laws are written to help the government achieve its ends, not to guarantee the freedom of the people\u2014and where police break the laws they are sworn to enforce. Regrettably, what happened to Roger Stone could happen to anyone.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat happened to Roger Stone can indeed happen to anyone. It just rarely happens to people like Roger Stone. Police militarization is a widespread problem in American society. It erodes trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve, and may therefore have a counterproductive effect on crime rates and police violence. While it may have been overkill to send twelve armed and armored federal agents to arrest the 66-year-old Stone before dawn, it\u2019s certainly not extraordinary under American standards. His experience just happens to be more commonly experienced by communities of color and Americans from disadvantaged backgrounds."

    "text": "\u201cThe evidence of systematic race discrimination during jury selection in this case is undeniable,\u201d wrote Judge John Allen. And not just undeniable, in Judge Allen\u2019s view, but patently intentional. He devoted nearly 10 pages of his 27-page ruling chronicling how prosecutors purposely violated Gates\u2019s constitutional rights by deploying one racist tactic after another. And then, after all that, the judge declared that he could not grant Gates a new trial based on this discrimination because of a six-part procedural standard Georgia courts apply in requests to overturn old convictions.\n\nEvery state has built into its criminal justice system rules designed to bring a measure of certainty and finality to old convictions. It makes sense. We all can agree that defendants cannot forever be entitled to raise new claims. But in Georgia, and in other states, the barriers to new evidence are way too high. For example, Gates had to prove that he didn\u2019t know about the jury discrimination when it occurred at trial, that it wasn\u2019t his fault that he didn\u2019t learn of it until decades later, and that the discovery of the prosecutorial misconduct \u201cprobably\u201d would have changed the outcome of his trial.\n\nThe judge didn\u2019t explain why the proof of intentional racial discrimination wasn\u2019t enough to grant Gates a new trial. It can\u2019t be because Gates\u2019s lawyers were diligent in seeking to raise the issue. The judge inexplicably didn\u2019t mention in his motion how hard Georgia officials fought to keep secret those old notes from Gates, the ones that proved the racism at the heart of the 1977 trial. Instead, Judge Allen ultimately found that Gates deserved a second chance because newly discovered DNA evidence demonstrated \u201cthat he is excluded as the contributor to the DNA of two key items of physical evidence\u201d in the case.\n\nGates is lucky in a sense. The case against him was so weak, and the evidence of official misconduct so pervasive, that his lawyers were able to surmount the procedural obstacles put into place by Georgia judges and legislators. But many other defendants in Georgia and beyond continue to serve wrongful convictions. The problem is acute, especially, when convicted defendants try to establish that their lawyers provided them with ineffective assistance of counsel. The problem has been eased in the past decade or so, on the other hand, when it comes to post-conviction DNA testing, thanks in large part to the Innocence Project.\n\nAt the heart of the matter is the role of reviewing courts. We all are taught in high school about how the system of appellate review in this country is supposed to weed out mistakes at trial. But over time, the system has devolved to the point where it tolerates, even encourages, unjust results. With one piece of legislation, Georgia could make it easier for defendants like Gates to establish their right to a new trial. Eliminate the need for a defendant to prove the new evidence \u201cprobably\u201d would have generated a different result. Redefine what \u201cdue diligence\u201d means where, as in Gates\u2019s case, prosecutors or police are hiding evidence."

    "text": "The majority of parents who reject these requirements today, however, aren\u2019t from vulnerable groups. They\u2019re opting out for their own religious or personal beliefs. Parents aren\u2019t legally allowed to do that in every state, but can in the two states experiencing major measles outbreaks. Religious exemptions are permitted in New York, where the outbreak is primarily affecting the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community. Both personal and religious exemptions are allowed in Washington, which according to one infectious disease researcher has become \u201ca major anti-vaccine hot spot due to non-medical vaccine exemptions that have nothing to do with religion.\u201d\n\nimmune.org\n\nRoutine childhood vaccination programs have been shown to prevent approximately 42,000 early deaths and 20 million cases of disease per year, saving $13.5 billion in direct costs. That\u2019s why non-medical exemption laws are opposed by the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Infectious Diseases Society of America\u2014basically every reputable medical organization out there. But nearly every state has them in some form. There is also \u201ctremendous variability in the rigor with which such beliefs must be proved or documented,\u201d according to the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS). In some states, \u201cparents simply need to state that \u2018their religion\u2019 is against vaccination to be granted an exemption, even though no major religions specifically discourage vaccination.\u201d\n\nThese problems are being compounded by the growth of the anti-vaccine movement, which argues that vaccines are more dangerous than the government and medical community claim, and thus no vaccines should be mandatory. Neither their facts nor their logic holds up. \u201cParents cannot be exempted from placing infants in car seats simply because they do not \u2018believe\u2019 in them,\u201d argues PIDS. States also don\u2019t allow belief exemptions for laws intended to protect other people, like driving a car without a license. \u201cWhether or not children should be vaccinated before childcare or school entry ought not be a matter of \u2018belief,\u2019\u201d the group argues. \u201cRather, it should be a matter of public policy based on the best available scientific evidence, and in this case the science is definitive: vaccines are safe and they save lives.\u201d\n\nSo why doesn\u2019t Congress just pass a vaccination law outlawing non-medical exemptions? \u201cWe would love it if they could do something at the federal level,\u201d said Rich Greenaway, the director of operations for the advocacy group Vaccinate Your Family. \u201cWe\u2019d be 100 percent behind it.\u201d But it\u2019s not clear that Congress has that legal authority. According to the Congressional Research Service, \u201cthe preservation of the public health has been the primary responsibility of state and local governments, and the authority to enact laws relevant to the protection of the public health derives from the state\u2019s general police powers.\u201d Creating a federal vaccination law would turn that historical precedent on its head.\n\nA federal vaccination law would also set the stage for a fierce legal battle with vaccine opponents that would almost certainly make its way to the Supreme Court. The risk of losing that battle, while providing a major platform for anti-vaxxers, might not be worth it. Besides, the state\u2019s authority to set vaccination requirements was already confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court over 100 years ago, and federal lawmakers also don\u2019t have much interest in taking that authority away, Greenaway said. \u201cThe legislators at the federal level, they kind of know that their states want to handle this and they step back from it.\u201d"

    "text": "The question I think we all should be asking ourselves is: at this time in America when there's so much evidence that our political system is broken - that both parties at the extreme are not representing the silent majority of the American people - isn't there a better way? pic.twitter.com/Gy1wf1cf8F \u2014 Howard Schultz (@HowardSchultz) January 28, 2019\n\nThere is good reason to believe that the \u201csilent majority\u201d Schultz evokes doesn\u2019t agree that the national debt is the \u201cgreatest threat\u201d facing the country\u2014and there is ample evidence that it isn\u2019t such a threat. Voters have recoiled when presented with proposals to cut entitlements like Social Security and Medicare. A President Schultz, moreover, could expect a serious political fight if he tried to significantly cut either social or military spending, which drive the public debt. But there is also growing evidence that debt scolds like Schultz are severely overstating the current risks. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming increasingly doubtful whether there\u2019s any right time for fiscal austerity,\u201d the Times\u2019 Paul Krugman argued earlier this year. \u201cThe obsession with debt is looking foolish even at full employment.\u201d Furthermore, the current situation is hardly dire.\n\n\n\nNow, investors are happy to buy U.S. debt at low yields (and to buy the bonds of much more highly indebted countries like Japan), and the former chief economist of the IMF has presented detailed evidence that the debt threat is overrated ... but 3/ https://t.co/7Nh6WPmxkg \u2014 Paul Krugman (@paulkrugman) January 26, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what else Schultz stands for. He has dismissed universal health care as too expensive and unrealistic, but otherwise has punted on the most salient political issues of the day. He has refused to address \u201chypothetical\u201d questions, like whether he we would raise taxes. For now, then, his potential candidacy revolves around a single issue, and yet there\u2019s no evidence that anti-debt voters exist in numbers that would propel Shultz to the White House, or even remotely close to it.\n\n\n\nDemocrats, notwithstanding House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s maddening devotion to pay-as-you-go rules, have long been unafraid to increase the debt to fund important social programs such as Obamacare. The Republicans have long used the national debt as a bogeyman to justify cuts to such programs, while simultaneously pushing for massive increases to the military budget and tax cuts for the rich. But their actions under Trump have given lie to their rhetoric, as they passed a $1.5 trillion cut despite being fully aware that doing so would balloon the deficit in a time of plenty. As for the public broadly, the percentage of Americans who say they worry a great deal about the national debt has been declining for years; voters increasingly are motivated by divisive issues like health care, immigration, and foreign policy.\n\n\n\nBut Schultz wouldn\u2019t make a weak candidate simply because his core issue isn\u2019t compelling enough. The fact is that nothing about him is compelling enough. For years now, sober pundits have made the case that someone like Schultz\u2014a successful businessman who is fiscally conservative and socially liberal\u2014should enter the political arena. To escape from decades of partisan gridlock, the argument goes, America needs an outsider who can cut through the Gordian knot of ideology and deliver real results.\n\n\n\nThe idea that outsiders make the best political leaders is baked into the American political consciousness. It\u2019s why Lincoln\u2019s supporters cast him as a log-splitting homesteader, and why George W. Bush, a trust fund kid from Connecticut, ran as a swashbuckling cowboy. But over the last three decades, particularly in the aftermath of the Republican Revolution of 1994, the notion that America needs a leader who comes from outside the two parties has been particularly resilient. Groups like No Labels, Third Way, and, most recently, WTF emerged to fill an imagined vacuum: that there exists an American political consciousness that has been obscured by partisanship, waiting to be tapped by the right candidate (which, inevitably, is a rich white man). But these groups\u2019 center-right economic agenda\u2014focused on the solvency of Social Security and Medicaid and lowering the National Debt\u2014has proven enormously unpopular in recent years.\n\n"

    "text": "Trump\u2019s attacks have spurred public support for the intelligence community\u2014but there is great danger in overlooking past abuses.\n\nMembers of Congress, too, are stumbling over each other to praise the agencies, when they should be scrutinizing them. New York Representative Jerrold Nadler, the senior Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, labeled the president\u2019s attacks \u201cwildly dangerous\u201d to American institutions. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat, accused Republicans of \u201can effort to torch the credibility of the FBI.\u201d And Chris Coons, a Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote in an email that \u201cthe men and women of the FBI are among the most professional and committed public servants in our nation.\u201d\n\nThis sudden backflip by lawmakers, the media, and the public is understandable, given the seriousness of the charges leveled against Trump and his overt and systematic attempts to thwart the Russia investigation. But there is a great danger to society in overlooking past issues of accountability and the potential harm to civil liberties and instead viewing the FBI and the spy world in a purely positive light. And as the rift between the president and America\u2019s spies grows wider, there is also an ominous possibility that the FBI and the intelligence agencies will no longer feel accountable to Trump, because they no longer see him as a legitimate partner or commander.\n\nIronically, much of the danger Trump poses can be laid at the feet of Barack Obama. Assuming that past norms would be future norms, Obama created the most powerful surveillance state the world has ever seen. Over eight years, he spent more than $100 billion on everything from eavesdropping satellites encircling the globe, to a million-square-foot building in the Utah desert for storing massive troves of intercepted data, to secret taps on the hundreds of thousands of miles of undersea cables that carry everything from tweets to Google searches to endless chatter. He also unleashed fleets of killer drones around the world, authorized the assassination of Americans without trial, and jailed more whistleblowers than all previous presidents combined.\n\nWhat Obama apparently never considered was that the Orwellian surveillance tools he created, and the precedents he set of killing and jailing Americans, could one day fall into the hands of a mountebank, demagogic president unrestrained by norms and perhaps even untethered from reality. One who may see them as preapproved weapons in his war to delegitimize his own government and attack political opponents, innocent Americans, and the press, which he has labeled \u201cthe enemy of the American people.\u201d\n\nIt was a prospect Senator Frank Church warned about more than 40 years ago, after taking a first look at the NSA\u2019s capabilities. \u201cIf this government ever became a tyranny,\u201d he said, \u201cthe technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny, and there would be no way to fight back, because the most careful effort to combine together in resistance to the government, no matter how privately it was done, is within the reach of the government to know.\u201d Four decades later, the NSA is light years ahead of where it was during Church\u2019s visit.\n\nWhere does Trump\u2019s hostility to the intelligence community come from? As the first president in history to enter the White House without any prior government experience, Trump had never worn a military uniform, viewed a classified document, approved a covert operation, or read an NSA intercept. He needed a guide to that opaque world\u2014and he found one in a bitter and ambitious former intelligence chief who ended his career with a boot: Lieutenant General Michael Flynn.\n\nUnlike many of his fellow general officers, Flynn attended a state university rather than West Point but nevertheless rose rapidly as an intelligence officer in Iraq and Afghanistan. For many years, he was a close friend of Stanley McChrystal, whom Obama dismissed as his top general in Afghanistan for publicly mocking senior administration officials, including Vice President Joe Biden. Flynn, McChrystal\u2019s intelligence chief, escaped unharmed\u2014despite a 2010 incident in a Berlin bar when he reportedly pretended to prostrate himself across a table, laughing, \u201cI worship the god of beer.\u201d According to Michael Hastings, a reporter for Rolling Stone who was with the group at the time, when someone asked, \u201cHow the hell did you ever get your security clearance?\u201d Flynn replied, \u201cI lied.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, Obama named him director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, making him the highest-ranking military intelligence officer in the country. His would be a short and rocky stint. According to a former longtime DIA official familiar with Flynn\u2019s tenure, Flynn\u2019s personality seemed to line up closely with Trump\u2019s. \u201cHe\u2019s ideologically driven,\u201d the former DIA official told me. \u201cHis attitude was very similar to Trump\u2019s.\u201d\n\nAs a branch of the Pentagon, the DIA typically functions in an orderly and regimented way. Under Flynn, however, chaos was the norm, and many employees rebelled against his roughshod management style. \u201cInstead of being a real innovator and creative, he was disruptive in not a good way,\u201d a former senior DIA official involved in advanced planning told me. \u201cHe clashed with the staff, and he had a temper.\u2026 People didn\u2019t like working for him.\u201d The former longtime DIA official agreed. \u201cHe treated people like crap,\u201d this official said. \u201cHe could yell at people, he could single people out.... He was the head of DIA, and he was a bully.\u201d\n\nFinally, in April 2014, less than two years after becoming director, Flynn was fired. But the very qualities that contributed to his ouster from the DIA\u2014his brash, over-the-top temperament and chaotic management style, as well as his right-wing views on terrorism and the world\u2014endeared him to Trump.\n\nIn contrast to Trump, President Lyndon B. Johnson worked closely with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and had a voracious appetite for intelligence reports. Corbis/Getty\n\nFlynn became one of Trump\u2019s key foreign policy advisers during the presidential campaign, and he set out to help Trump shatter old norms and create new ones\u2014an effort that he hoped would also remove the tarnish from his stars and allow him to regain his rightful place in the community from which he had been ingloriously ejected. It was an easy task, working for someone with a similar disregard for tradition, little respect for the national security bureaucracy, and no patience for slogging through briefing papers and multipage analyses. Both had common cause to go to war with the intelligence agencies\u2014Flynn to repay those who caused his downfall, and Trump to strike back at those who he believed sought to undermine his election victory.\n\nFrom early on, it was clear that Trump would not treat intelligence officials with the customary respect with which his predecessors had. On August 17, 2016, after Trump won the Republican nomination, intelligence officials assembled in New York to deliver the traditional intelligence briefing given to all new presidential nominees. Normally, this briefing is a somber occasion: Secrets are revealed for the first time, and the nominee traditionally listens respectfully and keeps all details of the meeting confidential. But according to NBC News, Flynn repeatedly challenged the briefers\u2014his ire so unchecked that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who also attended the meeting, reportedly told Flynn to shut up and \u201ccalm down.\u201d Trump later spoke publicly about the meeting, saying he could tell from the briefers\u2019 \u201cbody language\u201d that they were unhappy working for Obama.\n\nFlynn was officially appointed to be Trump\u2019s national security advisor in November 2016. Then, a brief three months later, Trump fired him for lying to Vice President Mike Pence and the FBI concerning a conversation with the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, about sanctions imposed on Russia by Obama. But Trump has continued to exhibit the dim view of the intelligence community that he inherited from Flynn. He has rejected the President\u2019s Daily Brief, for example\u2014long the single most important national security document a president reads every day. Packed with critical reports and potential threats from all of the spy agencies, it has been a staple for presidents for more than four decades. Trump, however, has declined to read it, demonstrating how little he values the intelligence community. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m, like, a smart person,\u201d he said in an interview on Fox News Sunday in December 2016. \u201cI don\u2019t have to be told the same thing and the same words every single day.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s enormous self-regard and disinterest in hearing outside opinions\u2014particularly any that diverge from his own\u2014has sparked fear that he could dispense with perhaps the spy world\u2019s most sacred rule: unbiased reporting. The Bush administration\u2019s decision to cast aside that norm helped lead to the disastrous war in Iraq. Unhappy with the CIA\u2019s more cautious reporting on possible weapons of mass destruction in that country, the White House set up a separate, secret unit inside the Pentagon to cherry-pick the intelligence the White House wanted to see. Today, Trump\u2014a man of endless conspiracy theories\u2014may now be following a similar path with regard to Iran and North Korea, potentially leading to an even more calamitous war.\n\nTrump\u2019s recent support of a controversial memo drafted by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee is a window on what might be happening in the dark recesses of the spy world. The deliberately slanted memo criticized a secret warrant issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to monitor the communications of one-time Trump aide Carter Page. It was released to the public despite the strong warnings of the FBI that it was fundamentally biased and inaccurate. The bureau expressed its \u201cgrave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo\u2019s accuracy.\u201d But Trump nonetheless tweeted that the memo \u201ctotally vindicates\u201d him in the Russia probe.\n\nCherry-picked intelligence reports helped lead to the Iraq War. Now Trump may be following a similar path with Iran and North Korea.\n\nAnd the closer Trump comes to a premature end to his administration\u2014whether the result of criminal indictments or the threat of impeachment\u2014the greater the danger that he will break the most serious norm of all: launching a war only as a last resort. If desperate enough, Trump may find a pretext to launch an attack against Iran or North Korea in an attempt to divert attention from his domestic troubles.\n\nAlready, Trump has denounced the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran. And his former secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, suggested that the Trump administration would support regime change in the Islamic Republic. Similarly, Trump has threatened North Korea with \u201cfire and fury like the world has never seen\u201d; flown bombers capable of dropping nuclear weapons near the Korean peninsula; positioned a Navy armada, complete with three aircraft carriers, in nearby waters; and continually taunted North Korea\u2019s leader with name-calling\u2014all of which could help create a pretext for war.\n\nOf course, a president having absolute trust and confidence in the intelligence community is equally wrong. A newly elected president should possess a healthy skepticism. It was a lesson President John F. Kennedy quickly learned when, before he took office, the CIA handed him its flawed plan, drawn up under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, to invade Cuba. Following the Bay of Pigs disaster, Kennedy fired CIA Director Allen Dulles, and thereafter he viewed intelligence reports with a far more critical eye.\n\nWith Trump, however, it\u2019s more an outright hatred and fear than a healthy skepticism\u2014fear that the FBI wants to prosecute him and a hatred of the spies for claiming the Russians interfered with the election, thereby casting doubt on its legitimacy, if not negating its outcome. And, at the risk of echoing Lloyd Bentsen\u2019s damning assessment of Dan Quayle in the 1988 vice presidential debate, in terms of truthfulness, temperament, and intelligence, Donald Trump is no Jack Kennedy.\n\nAdding to the concern, at a time when infotainment is replacing hard news, is the fact that much of the press, especially cable news, has also disregarded traditional norms\u2014chief among them the devotion to objective reality and the investment of considerable resources, both human and financial, toward probing the workings of the darkest elements of government. Instead, as Trump charges the FBI with political bias and the intelligence community with acting like Nazis, the media\u2014with the obvious exception of Fox News\u2014seems to have taken on the mantle of defenders and protectors of those deeply problematic institutions.\n\nIn so doing, they have squandered their objectivity and precious resources on a single story: Russian election hacking. Many of the same reporters who once labored to track down leads concerning civil liberties violations and war crimes are now dishing up breathless and questionable leaks about the Russia investigation. Last December, for example, ABC News suspended and demoted Brian Ross, its chief investigative correspondent, for rushing on air with an unverified and incorrect story claiming that Michael Flynn would testify that Trump, as a candidate, had directed him to make contact with Russian officials. Months earlier, CNN forced out three journalists over similar missteps.\n\nBy devoting so much attention to the Russia story, journalists are failing in the difficult job of developing sources within what the spy world calls \u201chard targets\u201d\u2014the CIA, the NSA, and other parts of the intelligence community. No one, it seems, deems it necessary to explore the ways in which the U.S. intelligence establishment has for years brazenly hacked, bugged, and stolen data from the elections of others\u2014even friends and neighbors such as Mexico. America the victim is always a far better story than America the perpetrator.\n\nThe public, therefore, may learn of an indictment a few hours or days before it happens but never learn what else the Trump administration is up to. Has the NSA\u2019s giant ear turned toward the United States again, based on a secret Justice Department ruling? Is the FBI once more rummaging through private papers via another legal loophole? The leaks currently emanating from within the intelligence agencies focus almost exclusively on Trump\u2019s unprecedented behavior. They say nothing about what covert operations may currently be underway.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s also possible that while publicly criticizing the intelligence agencies, Trump may also be secretly authorizing the NSA to spy on lawyers representing immigrants, Democratic lawmakers, and journalists. Or perhaps, at Trump\u2019s bidding, the CIA will soon begin the secret targeted killing of Americans overseas suspected of or charged with leaking, such as Edward Snowden. Yet even more troubling, perhaps, is the thought that these actions could take place without Trump\u2019s authorization. Given Trump\u2019s attacks, there is a danger of the spy agencies no longer feeling accountable to the White House and \u201cgoing rogue\u201d\u2014especially if the country suffers another terrorist attack. With a distracted president, little oversight, and Orwellian new tools, spy chiefs may simply begin making up the rules as they go along.\n\nFor an administration no longer constrained by norms or even the truth, all of these dangers and more are possible, since the ultimate norm is obeying the law. As Richard Nixon discovered, slipping from breaking norms to breaking laws is easily done. And if it\u2019s done in secret, the public may never know until it\u2019s too late."

    "text": "It\u2019s hard to argue that, at this moment in time, Brexit is worse for Britain than Trump is for America. But it\u2019s also easy to see how, half a decade from now, that will be true. And if that\u2019s so, it will be largely attributable to fundamental differences between the countries themselves.\n\nThe Founding Fathers built the American system of government with someone like Trump in mind: a corrupt demagogue who shows no interest in protecting minority rights or upholding the rule of law. Federal judges throughout the lower courts have blocked his administration\u2019s legally dubious policies from going into effect. American voters last fall handed Democrats control of House of Representatives to act as a check on the president. Impeachment threats appear to have blocked him from shutting down the Russia investigation. The damage would have been further minimized if Congress hadn\u2019t ceded so much of its power to the executive branch in recent decades.\n\n\n\nThings are much different across the Atlantic. Instead of an American-style constitution, the United Kingdom relies on an unwritten body of precedents and traditions to shape its political system. In practical terms, this means Parliament reigns supreme. Though Britain\u2019s judiciary is independent, judges can\u2019t overturn laws passed by the legislature, like their American counterparts can. The British monarch\u2019s executive powers are now exercised by the prime minister and members of his Cabinet, all of whom are also lawmakers themselves.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution determines what Congress can make laws about and what matters are left to the states. Parliament, on the other hand, has \u201csovereign and uncontrollable authority in making, confirming, enlarging, restraining, abrogating, repealing, reviving, and expounding of laws, concerning matters of all possible denominations, ecclesiastical, or temporal, civil, military, maritime, or criminal,\u201d Lord Blackstone, Britain\u2019s most celebrated jurist, wrote in the eighteenth century. \u201cIt can, in short, do everything that is not naturally impossible.\u201d\n\nEverything, that is, except forge a transitional agreement to leave the European Union. May\u2019s Conservative Party is torn between Brexit hardliners who demand a departure from the bloc at all costs and a range of other Tory factions that want something less destructive. Last year, she called a snap general election in hopes of securing a mandate to negotiate an agreement on Britain\u2019s behalf. Instead, her party lost seats and became dependent on support from Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party to stay in power. The DUP\u2019s influence has made it harder to reach a consensus on the Irish border, which is supposed to stay open under the Good Friday Agreement but likely will close if Britain crashes out of the EU."

      "Warren Breckman"
    ],
    "text": "In the economic sphere, liberals formed anything but a common front. To be sure, there were figures such as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat and Herbert Spencer who campaigned tirelessly for a minimal state and an unimpeded free market. But most nineteenth-century liberals were not doctrinaire champions of the free market, and they entertained a range of opinions about free trade and the extent of government intervention. John Stuart Mill is a particularly interesting case. In his young adulthood, Mill was a nondogmatic defender of laissez-faire, but as he aged, he witnessed the bevy of social problems that accompanied the growth of the industrial economy, and he became increasingly receptive to socialism. Ironically, an 1884 American abridgment of Mill\u2019s Principles of Political Economy removed all references to the benefits of state intervention, thereby cementing a distorted image of Mill as a free marketeer just five years after the publication of Mill\u2019s essays on socialism.\n\nRosenblatt says nothing about eighteenth and nineteenth-century German figures such as Pestalozzi, Goethe, and Wilhelm von Humboldt, who had a deep impact on Mill\u2019s conception of human flourishing. Instead, she maintains that Germany\u2019s great and largely neglected contribution to the history of liberalism came in the late nineteenth century, when activist intellectuals insisted on the compatibility of liberal values and state intervention aimed at creating the social preconditions of individual fulfillment. The impact of this so-called \u201cNew Liberalism\u201d was considerable. In Germany, it reoriented a somewhat older tradition of paternalistic state action toward modern values; it helped shift a significant part of the German socialist movement away from revolution and toward reformism. In a trajectory that Rosenblatt does not trace, it is also the intellectual ancestor of the post-1945 German idea of the Sozialmarktwirtschaft (social market economy).\n\nOnly in the post-World War II era, Rosenblatt argues, did liberals begin to dispense with the notion of the public good.\n\nThe German ideas found many supporters in fin-de-si\u00e8cle Britain, where William Gladstone had already done a lot to temper liberals\u2019 habitual suspicions of the working-class masses. This was the form that appealed to Progressive-era American liberals like Croly and Dewey. The onset of World War I dealt a blow to the credibility of all things German, but the resonances of New Liberalism certainly continued in the New Deal.\n\nOnly in the post-World War II era, Rosenblatt argues, did liberals begin to dispense with the notion of the public good and reduce liberalism\u2019s meaning to doctrinaire free market ideology and individualism. In a book attuned to the power of words, it is surprising that \u201cneoliberalism\u201d appears only once, in passing. Surely, the rise of neoliberalism, now charted in detail by several historians, is a crucial part of the story: After all, it was neoliberalism, with its anti-statism, its reduction of human relations to transactional logic, and its fundamental belief in the invisible hand, that presided over the narrowing of liberalism\u2019s meaning, even as neoliberalism steered those values toward the political right.\n\nIn her long history of liberalism, Rosenblatt\u2019s treatment of the twentieth century remains more or less restricted to showing the triumph of laissez-faire and individualist liberalism in America. Yet even in America, the \u201cgenerous\u201d stream of liberalism suggested by John Dewey persists\u2014though it has undoubtedly been battered and bruised in recent decades. What is more, she gives relatively little attention to the fate of liberalism in twentieth-century France and Germany, even though, in the decades after World War II, France and West Germany were arguably the strongest embodiments of the older liberal traditions that she contrasts with post-war American liberalism. After all, both social democrats and Christian democrats in postwar France and West Germany sought to balance protection of individual rights with broad social agendas, aimed at ensuring some degree of fairness in economic arrangements.\n\nRosenblatt\u2019s message for our own time is rather tepid. Clearly, she believes that a liberalism concentrated exclusively on the free market and individual rights is inadequate to a new era in which both liberalism and democracy are suffering renewed crises of legitimacy. \u201cLiberalism, there are those who say, contains within itself the resources it needs to articulate a conception of the good and a liberal theory of virtue. Liberals,\u201d she writes, \u201cshould reconnect with the resources of their liberal tradition to recover, understand, and embrace its core values.\u201d\n\nIt is useful to be reminded that liberals have long insisted on generosity, the need for state intervention, and overarching conceptions of the public good. But can one convincingly designate these civic-minded qualities the core values of a political tradition that for two centuries has also repeatedly declared its allegiance to possessive individualism and the free market? Both sets of values seem equally to exist in the internally conflicted soul of modern liberalism.\n\nInstead of leading us to a set of regenerative virtues, Rosenblatt\u2019s account underscores the dilemmas that have chronically plagued liberalism. The history of liberalism brims with examples of fine-sounding appeals to the public good, but how is that to be determined and by whom? A political tradition with roots in paternalistic elitism, liberalism is nevertheless a product of the modern age and must ally itself with democracy. This alliance has produced many moments of profound ambivalence. Appeals to the people mix with fears of the people\u2019s powers; despite the professed centrism of most liberals, modern history does not lack examples of liberals siding with authoritarians when faced by unpredictable radical democratic forces. And when calls to honor the public good bump up against self-interest, liberals often suffer a moment of queasiness that is usually salved by declaring a problem \u201ccomplicated.\u201d\n\nThe triumphalism of mid-century American liberals like Trilling and Hartz looks quaint measured against liberalism\u2019s long history, which far from tracing an arc of progress has been marked by ruptures, setbacks, self-contradictions, and cringe-worthy instances of hypocrisy. That vexed history revisits us presently, although it is not clear whether the period we are entering threatens to bring illiberal democracy or undemocratic liberalism. The great German historian Friedrich Meinecke remarked in 1927, on the eve of a collapse he did not yet foresee, that liberalism\u2019s \u201cstrength today is also its weakness\u201d\u2014\u201cIt is so fully absorbed into the entire organism of our life that it is either ignored or treated as self-evident.\u201d Too easily taken for granted, liberalism can wither and die, as Meinecke and his countrymen were soon to learn. Perhaps the best defense against that fate is not to defend liberalism, but to champion the liberal sentiments that animate a much broader political spectrum."

    "text": "The question I think we all should be asking ourselves is: at this time in America when there's so much evidence that our political system is broken - that both parties at the extreme are not representing the silent majority of the American people - isn't there a better way? pic.twitter.com/Gy1wf1cf8F \u2014 Howard Schultz (@HowardSchultz) January 28, 2019\n\nThere is good reason to believe that the \u201csilent majority\u201d Schultz evokes doesn\u2019t agree that the national debt is the \u201cgreatest threat\u201d facing the country\u2014and there is ample evidence that it isn\u2019t such a threat. Voters have recoiled when presented with proposals to cut entitlements like Social Security and Medicare. A President Schultz, moreover, could expect a serious political fight if he tried to significantly cut either social or military spending, which drive the public debt. But there is also growing evidence that debt scolds like Schultz are severely overstating the current risks. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming increasingly doubtful whether there\u2019s any right time for fiscal austerity,\u201d the Times\u2019 Paul Krugman argued earlier this year. \u201cThe obsession with debt is looking foolish even at full employment.\u201d Furthermore, the current situation is hardly dire.\n\n\n\nNow, investors are happy to buy U.S. debt at low yields (and to buy the bonds of much more highly indebted countries like Japan), and the former chief economist of the IMF has presented detailed evidence that the debt threat is overrated ... but 3/ https://t.co/7Nh6WPmxkg \u2014 Paul Krugman (@paulkrugman) January 26, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what else Schultz stands for. He has dismissed universal health care as too expensive and unrealistic, but otherwise has punted on the most salient political issues of the day. He has refused to address \u201chypothetical\u201d questions, like whether he we would raise taxes. For now, then, his potential candidacy revolves around a single issue, and yet there\u2019s no evidence that anti-debt voters exist in numbers that would propel Shultz to the White House, or even remotely close to it.\n\n\n\nDemocrats, notwithstanding House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s maddening devotion to pay-as-you-go rules, have long been unafraid to increase the debt to fund important social programs such as Obamacare. The Republicans have long used the national debt as a bogeyman to justify cuts to such programs, while simultaneously pushing for massive increases to the military budget and tax cuts for the rich. But their actions under Trump have given lie to their rhetoric, as they passed a $1.5 trillion cut despite being fully aware that doing so would balloon the deficit in a time of plenty. As for the public broadly, the percentage of Americans who say they worry a great deal about the national debt has been declining for years; voters increasingly are motivated by divisive issues like health care, immigration, and foreign policy.\n\n\n\nBut Schultz wouldn\u2019t make a weak candidate simply because his core issue isn\u2019t compelling enough. The fact is that nothing about him is compelling enough. For years now, sober pundits have made the case that someone like Schultz\u2014a successful businessman who is fiscally conservative and socially liberal\u2014should enter the political arena. To escape from decades of partisan gridlock, the argument goes, America needs an outsider who can cut through the Gordian knot of ideology and deliver real results.\n\n\n\nThe idea that outsiders make the best political leaders is baked into the American political consciousness. It\u2019s why Lincoln\u2019s supporters cast him as a log-splitting homesteader, and why George W. Bush, a trust fund kid from Connecticut, ran as a swashbuckling cowboy. But over the last three decades, particularly in the aftermath of the Republican Revolution of 1994, the notion that America needs a leader who comes from outside the two parties has been particularly resilient. Groups like No Labels, Third Way, and, most recently, WTF emerged to fill an imagined vacuum: that there exists an American political consciousness that has been obscured by partisanship, waiting to be tapped by the right candidate (which, inevitably, is a rich white man). But these groups\u2019 center-right economic agenda\u2014focused on the solvency of Social Security and Medicaid and lowering the National Debt\u2014has proven enormously unpopular in recent years.\n\n"

    "text": "Though some advocated for across-the-board reform, the dominant approach that emerged was providing vocational training for working-class students. These students dropped out of school at far greater rates than their more privileged peers, often because they needed to support their families financially. Yet the dominant assumption among reformers was that these students lacked the intellectual capacity to complete the standard curriculum. Insofar as that was the case, vocationalism was framed as a solution for keeping the slow-witted in school. Vocational education, wrote David Snedden, a policy leader in the early twentieth century, would be for \u201cthose who will do duty in the ranks, who will follow, not lead.\u201d\n\nFor the next several decades, vocational education was a key feature of the comprehensive high school, which was organized around a trio of academic tracks. High-ability students would take college-preparatory classes; average-ability students would receive the standard curriculum; and low-ability students would train to work with their hands. According to Harvey Kantor, most educational systems developed \u201cnew procedures in guidance and placement to sort and select students for jobs and into educational tracks.\u201d\n\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, however, vocational education came under increasing attack as an inherently inequitable approach to schooling. As a 1973 law review article concluded, pulling students out of the academic program was a move \u201cBased on the hopeless conclusion that \u2018these kids are dumb\u2019 and cannot be educated.\u201d UCLA professor Mike Rose recalled his own experience with tracking: \u201cIf you\u2019re a working-class kid in the vocational track \u2026 you\u2019re defined by your school as \u2018slow\u2019 [and] you\u2019re placed in a curriculum that isn\u2019t designed to liberate you but to occupy you.\u201d\n\nVocational education also faced another kind of criticism: that it simply couldn\u2019t be done well in the schools. Skilled instructors were hard to recruit and retain, particularly in light of their qualifications for private-sector work. Equipment was expensive and went quickly out of date. Learning generally occurred in isolation from important real-world contexts. And schools were severely limited in the number of trades they could reasonably promote.\n\nParticipation in vocational education has steadily declined over the past several decades. It does live on, re-branded as Career and Technical Education, and some research does find that vocational training can increase student retention and earning power. Other scholarship, however, has continued to raise questions about the over-representation of low-income students in vocational \u201cdumping grounds.\u201d\n\nWhen critics contend that America\u2019s public schools are preparing students for the jobs of the past, they are engaging in a kind of rhetorical feint. The implication is that today\u2019s students are already being trained for work, and that such a focus has always been an aim of schooling. It suggests that vocational training is something that Americans broadly agree upon, and that is simply in need of an update.\n\nIn reality, workforce preparation would represent a significant shift in the mission of schools. President Donald Trump made this shift plain in 2018 when he unveiled a plan to combine the Department of Education with the Department of Labor into a new agency called the Department of Education and the Workforce. (There seems to be little movement on the proposal since it was announced.)\n\nJobs certainly matter, and the future labor productivity of today\u2019s students will impact the entire economy. Yet even if schools could be reoriented to focus effectively on job training, the result would hardly be an unqualified good. Any shift in the present orientation of schools will come at the expense of school activities organized around the preservation of rights and liberties, as well as the inherent value of education. By and large, Americans of the past were unwilling to make that trade-off. If they\u2019re aware of what\u2019s happening, Americans of the present may be no different.\n\n\n\n*A previous version of this article stated that the Times editorial was published in 1890."

    "text": "The Justice Department, multiple congressional committees, and many of the nation\u2019s major news outlets have spent the past two years probing whether the Trump campaign illegally conspired with the Russian government during the 2016 election. I\u2019ve argued before that what they\u2019ve uncovered so far amounts to \u201csoft collusion\u201d at minimum\u2014an implicit understanding between Trump Tower and the Kremlin to damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy that didn\u2019t quite amount to an explicit quid pro quo. Friday\u2019s indictment of Stone, and that curious use of the passive voice by Mueller, do not prove \u201chard collusion,\u201d of course. But it moves the narrative one step closer in that direction.\n\nStone, a longtime Republican political operative, is the first person indicted by Mueller since last year\u2019s midterm elections. Though there has been widespread speculation that the special counsel\u2019s investigation is wrapping up, the new charges confirm his work will continue well into 2019. It also brings the investigation deeper into the president\u2019s inner circle: Stone worked briefly for the Trump campaign in the summer of 2015, then acted as an informal political adviser of sorts to Trump for the rest of the election. What\u2019s more, it sheds new light on other Trump campaign officials\u2019 eagerness for damaging material on Hillary Clinton, no matter how dubious its provenance.\n\nThe indictment itself comes as no surprise. Much of what Mueller describes in Friday\u2019s court filing was already public knowledge, and most observers expected that Stone would face some kind of charges since last summer. Stone had publicly claimed in August 2016 that he had inside knowledge of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\u2019s future disclosures after Assange published emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee. He also sent a tweet signaling that it would \u201csoon be [John] Podesta\u2019s time in the barrel\u201d two months before the Clinton campaign chairman\u2019s stolen emails became public. When those remarks came under scrutiny after the election, Stone repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.\n\nStone\u2019s contentious relationship with Randy Credico, a New York radio host who appears to be the person described as \u201cPerson 2\u201d in the indictment, also became public knowledge last year. Credico had previously interviewed Assange; Mueller\u2019s indictment says that Stone described Credico as an \u201cintermediary\u201d between himself and the WikiLeaks founder. While Congress and federal investigators dug into the circumstances surrounding Russian election meddling in 2016, Stone allegedly began pressuring and threatening Credico to lie about what had transpired.\n\nStone, according to the indictment, told Credico before his House Intelligence Committee testimony that he should pull a \u201cFrank Pentangeli,\u201d referring to a fictional mafioso in the second Godfather film who commits perjury before a congressional committee to refute allegations that the Corleone family runs a nationwide crime syndicate. Last April, Stone\u2019s efforts to pressure Credico took on a more violent overtone. \u201cOn or about April 9, 2018, Stone wrote in an email to [Credico], \u2018You are a rat. A stoolie. You backstab your friends-run your mouth my lawyers are dying Rip you to shreds,\u2019\u201d the indictment states. \u201cStone also said he would \u2018take that dog away from you,\u2019 referring to [Credico]\u2019s dog. On or about the same day, Stone wrote to [Credico], \u2018I am so ready. Let\u2019s get it on. Prepare to die [expletive].\u2019\u201d"

    "text": "The fraught situation in Venezuela seems to be coming to a head. On Wednesday, 35-year-old opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 declared himself interim president following widespread protests calling for the resignation of strongman Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the president and leader of the so-called Bolivarian Revolution that began under Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 1999. Guaid\u00f3 was quickly recognized by the United States, Canada, and Brazil. Mexico, under the new administration of leftist Andr\u00e9s Manuel Lopez Obrador, did not endorse Guaid\u00f3. In Russia, a key Maduro ally, members of parliament condemned the U.S. recognition, calling Guaid\u00f3\u2019s move a \u201ccoup.\u201d China, which has helped shore up Maduro\u2019s government in the past, remained silent.\n\nBy openly calling on foreign governments for support, Guaid\u00f3, an engineer who presides over the country\u2019s National Assembly, presents the sharpest and most consequential threat yet to Maduro\u2019s regime. In recent weeks, Venezuelan opposition leaders have intimated that Maduro is vulnerable and that a small show of force would be enough to force his ouster. Their goal was almost certainly to nudge friendly right-wing governments in Brazil and the United States toward supporting regime change. It remains unclear, however, that the military has turned decisively against Maduro, setting up the possibility of a far-reaching and deadly armed confrontation should Maduro resist ousting. Even if the armed forces have abandoned the president, the drastic step of removing him by force is unlikely to pacify this deeply divided nation. It would almost certainly make a bad situation worse.\n\nEarlier this month, Jorge Borges, an exiled opposition leader whom Maduro has accused of plotting his assassination, explained that the president \u201cremains in power, fundamentally, due to two things: the support of the military\u2014really just the upper ranks\u2014and the dictatorial know-how of the Cubans.\u201d Other than that, Borges noted, \u201cMaduro has nothing. There\u2019s no economic support, no diplomatic support, no political support ... I think he\u2019s irredeemably defeated and it\u2019s impossible for him to overcome the crisis he\u2019s created.\u201d\n\nIf the regime lacks popular support now, that wasn\u2019t always the case. Venezuela managed to secure real material and social gains for its poorest citizens under Maduro\u2019s predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. With the end of the so-called commodity boom following the global 2008 crash, however, Venezuela began a slow-motion process of economic collapse that the government has been unable to reverse. As a former advisor to Ch\u00e1vez put it in a recent interview, \u201ceven if it\u2019s sensationalized in the international press, the Venezuelan government also suffers from a lack of transparency, from corruption, and there is a general problem of mismanagement, lack of technical skills, and of qualified people in the right places.\u201d Maduro, a Ch\u00e1vez prot\u00e9g\u00e9, narrowly won the race to succeed him in 2013. In 2018, Maduro won a second term in an election many consider to have been rigged. As economic conditions have worsened in recent years, the regime has hardened to the point that the government can no longer be considered fully democratic. In May 2018, a 400-page independent report published by the Organization of American States concluded that Maduro bore responsibility for a litany of human-rights abuses: murders, extra-judicial executions, and torture, in addition to the ongoing humanitarian crisis linked to economic ineptitude."

    "text": "Ben Terris calls it \u201cPundititis.\u201d Democrats still haven\u2019t recovered from the trauma of Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss to Donald Trump, and it\u2019s causing them to wring their hands about every candidate emerging to challenge him in 2020. So the Washington Post reporter coined this term to describe \u201ca virus affecting the nervous system of Democratic voters that was born out of the 2016 elections. Those infected find themselves unable to fall in love with candidates, instead worrying about what theoretical swing voters may feel. Signs of Pundititis include excessive electoral mapmaking, poll testiness, and an anxious, queasy feeling that comes with picking winners and losers known as \u2018Cillizzasea\u2019\u201d\u2014a dig at Terris\u2019s former colleague.\n\nThis is not an inaccurate diagnosis of the Democrats today. Terris is also right to attribute this malady not only to the results of the last presidential election, but to the mainstream media\u2019s analysis of the emerging Democratic field. Reading much of the punditry of late, one might expect the primary season to be the political equivalent of WWE\u2019s Royal Rumble, a massive free-for-all in which the candidates beat each other to a pulp in a race to the left, leaving one wobbly\u2014and perhaps not very \u201celectable\u201d\u2014candidate standing for Trump to effortlessly defeat.\n\n\n\nFear not, afflicted ones. While Democrats are understandably scarred by 2016, the party has learned its lesson: There will be no coronation this time around, no stark contrast between two candidates representing their respective wings of the party. And while the 2020 primary thus will be crowded, it will be a marked contrast to the \u201cclown car\u201d Republican primary of 2016. For the next year, the Democrats will showcase a party that looks and sounds very different not only from the GOP, but from the Democratic Party of just a few years ago. Rather than a moment of anxiety, this should be a moment of hope and pride\u2014and Republicans should be the ones feeling queasy.\n\nDemocrats are gearing up for a long, contentious primary season. Nine major candidates have already entered the fray\u2014most recently South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, an openly gay 37-year-old military veteran, who announced on Wednesday. By the summer, that number may have ballooned to two dozen or more. That vast field will reflect the Democratic Party in all of its diversity, from ideology to race to sexual orientation to, yes, age. But that has some Democrats nervous that the unfolding contest will distract from the only thing that matters: beating Trump.\n\n"

      "Michael Friedrich"
    ],
    "text": "There\u2019s an aching sense, beneath the book\u2019s surface, of the rigid corseting that just barely contains modern life. As a curatorial assistant at the county art museum, April is a public employee, and her state-mandated vacation time practically schedules her nostalgia: \u201cI get all holidays off, paid.\u201d But these \u201clegal holidays,\u201d the book suggests, don\u2019t so much give us time to pause and reflect as to do more and more stuff. She relishes minor chores like wedding-dress shopping with her friend Libby, but even there she hears a morbid thrum: \u201cThere must\u2019ve been five thousand gowns, all zipped into clear plastic bags, looking like bodies in shrouds.\u201d\n\nDeath and Other Holidays is the rare book that treats relentless, humdrum grief with humor and pathos\u2014and without a shred of sentimentality. Before its publication, it won the Miami Book Fair/de Groot Prize for the Novella, and it\u2019s not hard to see why. It\u2019s a realist work in an unreal world. Vogel honors mortality and our awareness of it as the organizing facts of our humanity. With unparalleled tenderness, she recognizes our celebrations of life as heroic efforts to think about literally anything else. But over the course of one calendar year in April\u2019s life she also reminds us: Death is never far away, try as we might to ignore it.\n\n\n\nVogel is a poet first, and Death and Other Holidays is composed of short bursts of ultra-distilled prose. The simplicity of the details is touching. \u201cI used to have two fathers, but now I have none,\u201d begins the chapterlet titled \u201cPatrimony.\u201d April can barely speak aloud of her father\u2019s suicide, even to her therapist. When she finally does, it\u2019s to a stranger using the abdominal roller at her gym. His father, he tells her, did the same. \u201cSo there we were, a son and a daughter of suicides, trying to keep our stomachs strong,\u201d she reflects. The book is full of details like this, unexpectedly intimate moments in commercial space.\n\nApril\u2019s stomach is strong against grief, but also against intimacy. At first, she seems detached, passing casually through a series of empty relationships with empty types. Paternal surrogates whom she calls Crash Man, Leaf Man, Math Man, Motorcycle Man, and Critic Man sound like figures from the primitive theater (or else like the level bosses of a Nintendo game). Crash Man can\u2019t stay awake at the wheel. Math Man uses equations to predict the future. Critic Man pronounces her furniture arrangement \u201cdysfunctional.\u201d Each seems to pose a particular menace, and yet each is barely there.\n\nBy fall, she has become more serious about photography, developing prints in a darkroom in her closet. With this seriousness comes new insight. \u201cYou immerse the paper in a tray of fluid until an image appears, slowly at first, then all at once, as if you were recalling something you forgot.\u201d The camera, with its more-seeing eye, not only captures but remembers. Vogel lets us wonder at it with her: \u201cIt\u2019s a mystery how I could have been right there and have missed so much, in my mind, I mean, not the actual shot.\u201d A Fourth of July celebration at Libby and her fianc\u00e9 Hugo\u2019s house had come and gone without event. But her photos give her a second look at Hugo\u2019s cousin, Victor (\u201cin a halo of sparklers\u201d), and his dog, Argos (\u201ceyeing the burgers\u201d). The memory of the holiday becomes something new and hopeful."

    "text": "In 2009, Diana Athill, the renowned literary editor and award-winning writer who died this week at the age of 101, moved from her big flat on the edge of London\u2019s Hampstead Heath into a retirement home. \u201cAlmost at once on arrival at the home I knew that it was going to suit,\u201d she wrote of the move. \u201cAnd sure enough, it does. A life free of worries in a snug little nest.\u201d At the time, I was working in the secondhand department of a North London bookshop, unsure whether to commit to university or to itinerant bookselling. One day my boss told me to get in the car, because we were going to \u201cpack up the books\u201d of a person with a great collection.\n\nIt felt sad, at first, to remove the evidence of such a long and brilliant career in readership. But as I carefully placed Athill\u2019s library into cardboard boxes, she didn\u2019t seem heartbroken at all. We didn\u2019t even give her a particularly good price for the books, yet she didn\u2019t mind. It was my prejudice as a young person that made all these objects seem of the utmost value for a writer and a thinker. If ever there were a lesson that one\u2019s literary life exists beyond shifts in material circumstances, inside one\u2019s head, then Diana Athill\u2019s career is it.\n\nAfter graduating from Oxford in 1939, Athill began her career at the BBC Overseas Service, where she worked throughout World War II. She was then instrumental in founding the publishing house Allan Wingate with her friend Andr\u00e9 Deutsch\u2014renamed after him in 1951. Her list of authors might remain unparalleled among editorial careers. She handled the egos of a litany of male writers, including Norman Mailer, Philip Roth, John Updike, Jack Kerouac, and V.S. Naipaul. When Naipaul left the house (for the first time; he would return), Athill described it as a \u201crelief.\u201d She wrote of Sir Vidia that, \u201cHe was easily the most difficult writer I\u2019ve ever worked with.\u201d Not all her authors were male and difficult, of course; her other clients included heavyweights like Margaret Atwood, Stevie Smith, Simone de Beauvoir, Jean Rhys, and Gitta Sereny.\n\nIn 1958, Athill won The Observer\u2019s short story competition, to her great surprise. Later she would write that she wanted to be buried \u201cwith a copy of The Observer folded under my head, for it was The Observer\u2019s prize that woke me up to the fact that I could write and had become happy.\u201d The excellently titled story collection An Unavoidable Delay (1962) was Athill\u2019s first published writing. A novel followed, 1967\u2019s Don\u2019t Look at Me Like That, and another story collection in 2011, Midsummer Night in the Workhouse."

It is roughly what the Portuguese star, worth around $450 million, makes each quarter. And while the 33-year-old\u2014who\u2019s also currently under investigation for an alleged rape in Las Vegas\u2014may be a particularly distasteful example, it\u2019s just the tip of the international tax-evasion iceberg in modern soccer, which thanks to whistleblowers and investigative journalism is now slowly being revealed.\n\nRonaldo, a five-time FIFA world player of the year who last summer moved from Real Madrid to Italian giant Juventus, has become a human billboard since bursting onto the global stage as a teenager with Manchester United. He owns businesses in footwear, fragrances, gyms, a creative agency, hotels and underwear. He endorses watches, shampoo, online gambling\u2013even steelworks. His sponsored social media posts can fetch hundreds of thousands of dollars. His legs are insured for $144 million.\n\nThe star\u2019s tax strategy is similarly diffuse. In accusing the player of four counts of tax evasion between 2011 and 2014, a Madrid state prosecutor said Ronaldo \u201cintentionally\u201d did not declare income, falsely reported income as coming from real estate, and funneled cash through a Virgin Islands-incorporated firm to \u201ccreate a screen in order to hide his total income from Spain\u2019s tax office.\u201d\n\nThe deal cut with the Madrid court includes both the hefty payment to the Spanish state, and 23 months in jail. But first offenders with a custodial sentence below two years in Spain almost always avoid time behind bars. The same day, former Real teammate Xabi Alonso visited the same court, accused of defrauding the taxman of $2.3 million. His case continues."

    "title": "Francis Fukuyama\u2019s Shrinking Idea",
    "authors": [
      "Alan Wolfe"
    ],
    "text": "At a time of populist unrest, bitter political polarization, and rampantly spreading authoritarianism, Fukuyama\u2019s book now appears to have been written for another planet. Far from avowing the triumph of liberal democracy, in 2019 many believe we will be lucky to hold on to the dwindling number of liberal democracies we have. And the force that may do us in appears to be the very opposite of Hegel\u2019s universality: the obsessive particularism of ethnic identification.\n\nPerhaps understanding the possibility of obsolescence, Fukuyama has worked hard to keep his idea alive. He published other books, none of them so intensely discussed, in which he adjusted his thesis to account for new events and in particular to place a greater emphasis on culture at the expense of economics. In the preface to his new book, Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment, he returns once again to the controversy he started and tries to defend himself against (unnamed) critics. Those critics, he maintains, simply misunderstood him; by \u201cend\u201d he meant a target or a destination, not a literal ending. Besides, he writes, the original article had a question mark at the end of its title (although the book, which attracted far more attention, did not). This is another problem with the One Great Idea book: The author has invested so much in what he has written that he has to perform exceedingly lame twists and turns later just to keep it on the playing field.\n\nPerhaps the most significant concession that Fukuyama\u2019s new book makes is its lack of world-defining ambition. Identity runs to scarcely half the length of The End of History. It does emphasize the importance of identity, but not to the exclusion of everything else. Its chapters are short and to the point. Older and wiser than when he wrote his most famous work, Fukuyama is less given to grand pronouncements. Identity is merely a book, not a blockbuster.\n\nTo be sure, Fukuyama\u2019s new book does contain a thesis. As it happens, the new idea stands in the sharpest possible contrast to the older one. Liberal democracy, far from showing us a glimpse of a universalist future, now, we are told, faces a severe crisis. Rapid economic growth makes contemporary liberal democracies attractive destinations for people seeking a better life. But the resulting diversity, furthered by the new groups seeking recognition, is attacked by groups already in the home country as a lowering of their status. \u201cThe retreat on both sides into ever narrower identities threatens the possibility of deliberation and collective action by the society as a whole,\u201d he writes. \u201cDown this road lies, ultimately, state breakdown and failure.\u201d With the rise of ethnic politics, there may soon be few if any liberal democracies left. The particular has completely subsumed the universal.\n\nFukuyama\u2019s new pessimism is far deeper than his discarded optimism. The left-right dichotomy that formerly polarized liberal democracy dealt with the question of the proper size of government; compromise, at least in theory, was always possible. Today, he argues, we are dealing with problems of recognition and resentment, and they are more difficult to resolve. As Fukuyama pithily puts it: \u201ceither you recognize me, or you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nOn this key point, I believe, Fukuyama is incorrect. Partial recognition is not only possible\u2014it is common. Biracialism, religious syncretism, and the invention of traditions all allow for compromises over identity. In fact, what we witness in one country after another in today\u2019s world is an astonishing blending of elements once considered fixed: the crumbling of racial and religious sameness on display at the latest wedding of an English prince; the popularity of new age religious rituals and rhetoric; the celebrated successes of the diverse French soccer team; the composition of any major symphony orchestra. Identity may be important, but identity is fungible. We make what we are.\n\nThis is not a position to which Fukuyama subscribes. Rather than treating collective identities as works in progress, he views efforts at recognition such as nationalism or religious fundamentalism as residing in, of all places, the human soul. To appreciate the power of such forces, he writes, we need to return to Socrates and the stress he placed on thymos, or the need to be treated as worthy by others. (Fukuyama included a discussion of thymos in The End of History.) Under modern conditions, moreover, people not only want recognition from their peers, they want a feeling of self-worth as well. If we are to understand why Syrians are being killed, why Croats and Serbs continue to distrust one another, why Ukrainians despise Russians, and even why Donald Trump was elected, thymos may provide the answer.\n\nIt is widely believed that another One Great Idea book, Huntington\u2019s The Clash of Civilizations, which foresaw a new era of divisions and conflicts, was written in response to The End of History. In Identity, Fukuyama concedes the debate to his former teacher. Indeed, he goes beyond him. For Huntington the clash of civilizations was primarily cultural, a struggle between the competing traditions and worldviews of the West, the Islamic world, and China. For Fukuyama the clash over status, when it isn\u2019t governed by thymos, \u201cis rooted in human biology\u201d and therefore unlikely ever to disappear. \u201cOur present world is simultaneously moving toward the opposing dystopias of hypercentralization and endless fragmentation,\u201d he concludes. It is difficult to be more pessimistic than that.\n\nFor all its failure to make accurate predictions, The End of History dealt at least with the future. Not many thinkers were discussing the end of history when Fukuyama began, and that fact contributed to the uniqueness of his book. Identity is not like that. Almost nothing in Fukuyama\u2019s book is new: Charles Taylor (whom Fukuyama cites) has written about the politics of recognition, and a host of writers far too numerous to credit here have written about ethnicity, borders, globalization, strong religion, and every variety of nationalism. Identity summarizes arguments that already seem dated. It is, moreover, primarily concerned with the recent past, and when it ventures to make a prediction, it simply carries current trends into the future.\n\nUncovering trends is valuable even if there is no guarantee that the trends will continue. You can be wrong and still change the world.\n\nWhat, moreover, are we to do with the political conflicts raised by identity politics? Here too Fukuyama\u2019s analysis is disappointing. He blames both the left and the anti-immigrant right for their unbending attachment to \u201cunderstandings of identity based on fixed characteristics such as race, ethnicity, and religion.\u201d But the left (and for all I know the right) is divided between essentialists who hold that race and gender are fixed and the social constructionists who believe the exact opposite. He even claims, against all evidence, that our present stalemate over immigration is caused by those who oppose any form of \u201camnesty\u201d and those \u201copposed to stricter enforcement of existing rules,\u201d when in fact it is on the right, and the right only, where intransigence and unyielding intolerance reigns. I agree with him that, in theory, it is easy to imagine trade-offs that can improve America\u2019s dreadful policies toward immigrants. But to realize them, we need to explore the disproportionate influence of rural areas and the South in Congress, the failure of leadership in the Republican Party, the obdurate persistence of racism, and other messy realities that do not find much expression in this book.\n\nThe contrast between Fukuyama\u2019s first book and this one raises a question of form as well as content. For writers of nonfiction, getting reality wrong would seem to be the biggest imaginable sin, a luxury allowed to fiction writers but not to us. Simply being wrong, however, is not Identity\u2019s major problem. The End of History was wrong, but it was also stimulating, breathtakingly ambitious, a paean to the importance of ideas. Karl Marx got his One Great Idea\u2014that the future belonged to communism\u2014wrong, but he is not therefore, in the famous words of Paul Samuelson, a \u201cminor post-Ricardian.\u201d History befuddles all who write about it. Uncovering trends is valuable even if there is no guarantee that the trends will continue. You can be wrong and still change the world. Identity, by contrast, both begins and ends with a whimper. Nothing is startling and little is gained.\n\nGive me The End of History over Identity any time. Rehashing is not Fukuyama\u2019s strength, but that is what he does here. I am no better at predicting the future than anyone else, but I am willing to bet that in five years, Fukuyama\u2019s Identity will be all but forgotten. That will be a shame. We lack great One Great Idea books. I hope there is out there someone in his or her thirties or forties willing to take a chance on something that will have us talking as long as The End of History did.\n\n"

    "text": "Beim wondered how these scientific advances were being used to treat infertility, but to her surprise no one was studying it. She feared it would be decades before women would have the same kinds of detailed diagnoses cancer patients now receive. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why we should approach women\u2019s health two decades into the post-genomic era the same way that we did in the pre-genomic era,\u201d she told me. So she de\u00adcided to shift her focus from cancer research to women\u2019s reproductive health. \u201cI had this \u2018Aha\u2019 moment where I realized, this is not happening in this field,\u201d Beim said. \u201cThis is my calling.\u201d\n\nBeim kept hearing from women who had failed multiple rounds of fertility treatment and didn\u2019t know why. \u201cThe universal feeling was, \u2018Why didn\u2019t anyone tell us this was a possibility?\u2019\u201d\n\nBeim dropped out of her postdoc at Cambridge, moved back to New York, and spent the next several months sleeping on friends\u2019 couches while she launched Celmatix. She traveled light, whittling her belongings down to what could fit into a single suitcase.\n\nIn order to build its genetic test, Celmatix had to document the known connections between fertility and genetics. There is little information about how various aspects of women\u2019s health\u2014medical history, family history, lifestyle choices\u2014contribute to or correlate with fertility, so Beim set out to build a data set from scratch. She hired scientists and researchers to scour medical journals for relevant information, and she partnered with fertility clinics around the country to combine their patient information into a single database. Until that point, the information available to fertility doctors was limited to the data from their individual clinics, as well as their anecdotal experience. By combining information from multiple clinics, Beim hoped to be able to calculate more accurately whether, when, and how a couple would get pregnant. Celmatix\u2019s data set is now the largest database about reproductive health in the world.\n\nIn 2015, the company released its first product, Polaris, custom software that allows fertility clinics to compare a couple\u2019s health information with the data Celmatix had collected and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Polaris can forecast how likely a couple is to get pregnant using different treatment methods\u2014intrauterine insemination versus in-vitro fertilization, for example. It can assess the probability of twins or triplets. And it can calculate the probability of having a child when couples repeat treatments or move on to new ones. In 2018, Celmatix also launched MyFertility Compass, a free online tool that offers couples similar information.\n\nNot only can this analysis help fertility doctors pursue more effective treatments, it can also help couples plan financially. If a couple has a better chance of conceiving after one round of IVF than three rounds of IUI, for example, Celmatix might suggest that a couple try IVF sooner, because doing so could save money or allow for more rounds of treatment. Alan Copperman, the medical director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York, one of the top fertility clinics in the country, uses Polaris to help couples set expectations. \u201cThere\u2019s so much anxiety that goes along with fertility treatment,\u201d Copperman said. It can be grueling, with high physical, emotional, and financial costs. With Polaris, you \u201ccan\u2019t always fix it, but you can help them see what their journey is going to look like or what it\u2019s going to take to achieve success.\u201d\n\nRight now, Celmatix\u2019s data only addresses fertility, but the company has a partnership with the genetic testing firm 23andMe that gives Celmatix access to a cache of data about other elements of women\u2019s health as well. Beim told me she hopes to eventually help women navigate not just fertility, but their lifelong health. \u201cFrom the first decision she\u2019s making about what contraceptive should I use, or how do I manage my endometriosis, all the way out to the menopause transition,\u201d she said. Beim has big ambitions. \u201cThis is the beginning.\u201d\n\nAt the same time that Beim was launching her business, she was also reckoning with her own family planning. Not long after she founded Celmatix, she went to a friend\u2019s dinner party. There she met a venture capitalist named Nicholas Beim, who, among other projects, was supporting entrepreneurs in Turkey, where Piraye was born. Three months later, she joined him on a business trip there; two months after that, they were engaged. Within eleven months of meeting, they were married.\n\n\n\nBeim was 32 at the time, and just as they had approached their relationship with alacrity, she and Nicholas knew they wanted to start a family right away. Shortly after their honeymoon, Beim found out she was pregnant. The couple happily shared the news with family and close friends. Their early enthusiasm turned to grief, however, when the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. As a scientist working in women\u2019s health, Beim was well aware that 15 to 20 percent of pregnancies end in miscarriage. Still, she was devastated.\n\nThe couple kept trying to get pregnant for another year and a half before Beim went to see a doctor. She looks back on this time as a period of avoidance that she now wishes she could take back. \u201cNot knowing doesn\u2019t make it change or go away,\u201d she told me. A hormone test revealed that she had diminished ovarian reserve\u2014a condition that affects between 10 and 30 percent of women who experience infertility. Women with diminished ovarian reserve have fewer eggs, and it\u2019s harder for them to get pregnant, either naturally or with IVF.\n\nBeim sought a second opinion. That doctor diagnosed her with endo\u00admetriosis, a painful disease that can also affect a woman\u2019s ability to have children; about 40 percent of women with endometriosis find it difficult to get and stay pregnant. Beim\u2019s doctor, however, advised her to try to conceive naturally for six more months before investing in IVF. Beim researched natural ways to boost her fertility and made changes to her diet. She was pregnant with her first son within a month.\n\nBecause Beim knew her egg reserves were low, she and her husband decided to expand their family as quickly as possible. Beim gave birth two more times in the next three years. She now has two sons, ages 4 and 5, and a daughter, who is 1. Photographs of Beim from early articles about Celmatix often show her holding her round belly or nuzzling an infant. Beim has spent most of her years as CEO pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\nFemtech companies may be little more than a modern gloss on the health and beauty industry, applying a veneer of feminism to age-old appeals to women\u2019s fears and insecurities.\n\nBeim cites her own miscarriage and accelerated family planning as a huge influence on Celmatix. \u201cI had three kids in four years, in part because I understood my metrics and I understood that if I wanted to have a family, then I wasn\u2019t going to be able to space my kids very far apart,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I had had this information earlier in my life, there are other things that I could have miti\u00adgated. I could have lived a much healthier lifestyle. I could have started my family much earlier so I wouldn\u2019t have had to get it all done under the gun before I fell off a fertility cliff. It worked out for me. But it could have not.\u201d\n\nMany tech startups are closely identified with their founders, and it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt Celmatix to have Beim serve as the company\u2019s face: a woman who, by closely analyzing her own health, was able to make informed decisions and overcome her fertility problems to have the family she wanted. This is the narrative that Beim is selling: In the face of uncertainty and the dreaded biological clock, Celmatix can give women valuable information, a sense of control, and a path toward motherhood.\n\nBut Beim\u2019s story also highlights some of the contradictions that she and Celmatix embody. Celmatix aims to disprove the idea that older women can\u2019t have healthy children or that infertility is the result of poor lifestyle choices. The \u201cfertility cliff\u201d that women supposedly hit when they turn 35 isn\u2019t an insurmountable obstacle, the company suggests, but something that can be navigated on an individual basis through science and data. For some women, however, having more detailed information about their fertility doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to feelings of empowerment; knowing more about one\u2019s reproductive limitations can just as easily cause anxiety and grief. Neither Celmatix nor any other femtech company can avoid the fact that fertility changes as people age, for both men and women. Despite Celmatix\u2019s assurances, the biological clock is real, and the outcomes aren\u2019t always as positive as they were for Beim.\n\nIn 2017, after eight years of development and a lengthy approval process, Celmatix finally released its proprietary ge\u00ad\u00adnetic test, called Fertilome. By examining 49 variants in 32 genes, the test can help identify a variety of fertility disorders, including polycystic ovarian syndrome, endometriosis, recurrent pregnancy loss, and primary ovarian insufficiency\u2014a rare condition that occurs in approximately 1 percent of women and causes premature menopause. The test requires a simple blood or saliva sample. Women can request it through a physician for $950. Patients receive a detailed report on each of their tested genes, indicating a strong, moderate, or weak risk for a reproductive condition.\n\nBeim was one of the first women to take the Fertilome test. The results confirmed what her doctors had suspected: She had genetic markers associated with endometriosis and primary ovarian insufficiency, as well as alterations in key genes that make it harder for her body to regulate inflammation, which affects whether an embryo will implant cor\u00adrectly in the uterine lining.\n\nFifteen months after the test launched, more than 100 doctors around the country had ordered it for their patients. One of Celmatix\u2019s customers is a 35-year-old woman named Amie, who requested that her last name not be published to protect her privacy. A nurse at a neonatal intensive care unit in San Jose, California, Amie always knew she wanted to have children. \u201cAt least one boy and one girl,\u201d she told me. She had never really experienced any menstrual issues until she was 29 or 30, when her period became irregular. A specialist diagnosed her with diminished ovarian reserve, one that was \u201cmore reflective of someone who might be menopausal.\u201d No doctor was able to tell her what might be causing her condition or how to treat it.\n\nWhen Amie got married in 2015, she and her partner decided to try to have children right away\u2014\u201cbecause I knew there might be some challenges,\u201d Amie said. A year of trying came and went. Then, in 2017, she visited a fertility doctor, Aimee Eyvazzadeh, in San Ramon, California, who suggested that Amie take the Fertilome test. The results showed that Amie had a genetic variant that may decrease follicle stimulation\u2014the cause of her low egg reserves. \u201cThere was nothing that I could have done to prevent it,\u201d Amie said. \u201cIt gave me a lot of closure.\u201d\n\nIt also gave her doctor new ideas for treatment. Because Amie\u2019s ovaries don\u2019t naturally produce mature eggs, Eyvazzadeh stimulated her ovaries with oral medications and estrogen patches. An ultrasound revealed one promising follicle. \u201cThe doctor said, \u2018This is your golden egg,\u2019\u201d Amie told me. She got pregnant using IVF and gave birth to a baby boy in May. Her baby is already sporting a double chin and \u201cjuicy thighs,\u201d Amie said. She said she\u2019s enjoying every aspect of motherhood so far.\n\nThings don\u2019t always go so well, however. Leah Kaye, formerly a reproductive endocrinology fellow at the Center for Advanced Reproductive Services at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine, told me about a patient at the clinic, Elizabeth (not her real name), who is 38 years old. She and her husband had tried intrauterine insemination three times without success before moving on to two failed rounds of IVF. At that point her doctor recommended that Elizabeth try the Fertilome test. It suggested a genetic variant in Elizabeth\u2019s androgen receptor, which could potentially influence the function of her ovaries and uterus. In response, her doctors prescribed a course of progesterone and some additional androgen before transferring the next embryo. The procedure was a success\u2014Elizabeth got pregnant for the first time, with twins\u2014until it wasn\u2019t. The pregnancy lasted just seven weeks. Elizabeth hasn\u2019t been back to the fertility clinic since.\n\nI remarked to Kaye how wrenching Elizabeth\u2019s story was. Her response was gentle and open-minded. \u201cWe try to remind our patients after a setback like this that families can grow in all sorts of ways, not just the more conventional ways we learn about growing up,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen a couple wants to have a family bad enough, we always reassure them that they will make that family, in one way or another, even if it wasn\u2019t by the exact route they initially envisioned.\u201d\n\nThat honest acknowledgment of the limits of biological science runs counter to much of Silicon Valley\u2019s sloganeering. For all its innovative science, Celmatix isn\u2019t offering a cure, much less a treatment, for infertility. For now, the most Celmatix can do is give doctors a hint about what might be wrong. All the doctors I spoke with emphasized that Fertilome may help an experienced reproductive endocrinologist identify new pathways or tweaks for treatment, but no one could say for sure whether this information would lead to the birth of a healthy baby. Brian Levine, the director of CCRM New York, part of a respected chain of fertility clinics, calls Fertilome \u201ca highly refined Ouija board.\u201d It might point women in the direction of answers\u2014but it might not.\n\nThere are reasons to be skeptical about the booming femtech industry. In 2014, a company called Ovascience claimed to have identified \u201cegg precursor\u201d cells, which it said could improve a woman\u2019s chances of conceiving children and even pause or reverse the biological clock. In 2016, Wall Street valued the company at $1.8 billion. Yet no reputable studies have been able to support the company\u2019s claims, and scientists have expressed doubt about whether such cells even exist; in late 2016, Ovascience\u2019s valuation dropped to $47 million. In 2015, another company raised more than $160,000 on Kickstarter to produce the world\u2019s first \u201csmart\u201d menstrual cup, outfitted with a Bluetooth sensor that would signal when the cup needed to be emptied. The campaign went viral and garnered favorable coverage from Fortune, Slate, Jezebel, and others, but more than two years after the cups were supposed to ship, the company is still doing preliminary testing.\n\n\n\nPeriod-tracking apps have also caused controversy. In 2015, Glow, a popular app backed by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, claimed that it had helped more than 150,000 couples get pregnant\u2014a figure that experts criticized as questionable. A year later, Consumer Reports showed that Glow\u2019s lack of security features exposed women\u2019s data to significant privacy threats. (The company quickly moved to correct this.) A 2016 study in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine found that many popular period trackers did not accurately predict when women were most fertile. Then, in 2017, a much-hyped Swedish fertility tracking app called Natural Cycles was certified in the European Union as a contraceptive after a major study found that it was 99 percent effective at preventing pregnancy during \u201cperfect use\u201d and 93 percent effective during \u201cimperfect use\u201d\u2014roughly on par with more established forms of birth control, like the pill. By tracking a woman\u2019s basal temperature, the Natural Cycles app makes predictions about when a woman is most likely to be ovulating and gives either a red light or a green light on whether it is safe to have unprotected sex. Soon after, a Swedish hospital reported that 37 women who had recently sought abortions there were using Natural Cycles as their sole form of birth control. The Swedish government investigated, ultimately determining that the number of unwanted pregnancies was in line with the product\u2019s advertised \u201ctypical use\u201d failure rate. Despite the controversy, the Food and Drug Administration approved the app in August for use in the United States.\n\nThe shadow of Theranos also looms over health care startups. Elizabeth Holmes, Theranos\u2019s CEO, convinced the world that she had developed the technology to perform dozens of medical tests with a single drop of blood\u2014claims, it turns out, that were complete fabrications. Last March, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Holmes with massive fraud for deceiving investors, and in June a federal grand jury indicted her on several counts of criminal wire fraud.\n\nFor all the startups focused on diagnosing or treating a serious health condition, there are others simply trying to ride the current feminist wave to a generous payday.\n\nCelmatix is no Theranos: The Fertilome test passes muster in New York state, which has some of the strictest requirements in the country, and the company works closely with doctors and the academic community, exhibiting the sort of transparency that Theranos resisted. \u201cTheir leadership is outstanding, their science is incredible,\u201d said Levine. \u201cPiraye is brilliant. Every time I talk to her, I feel smarter.\u201d\n\nBeim is confident that Celmatix is helping women who are struggling to get pregnant. \u201cThe dream when we started was that babies that would not exist without us all showing up at work every day and working our tails off for a decade would exist one day\u2014and we\u2019re there,\u201d she told me. \u201cIf what we\u2019re doing makes it a little bit more likely that women can get to have as many healthy kids as they want, on their own terms, it\u2019s worth it.\u201d Yet many fertility experts remain concerned that we still don\u2019t know enough about how genetics affect fertility for Celmatix\u2019s testing to be truly useful. \u201cThe difference here is having knowledge versus the wisdom of how to apply it,\u201d said Francisco Arredondo, a reproductive endocrinologist and owner of three fertility clinics in Texas.\n\nTen years after Beim founded Celmatix, the femtech industry is awash in companies whose products range from the significant to the superfluous. For all the startups focused on diagnosing or treating a serious health condition, such as infertility or endometriosis, or developing a new form of birth control, there are others that are simply trying to ride the current feminist wave to a generous payday.\n\nAll of the money currently being invested in femtech might be a sign that Silicon Valley finally considers women as individuals whose needs and desires actually matter. But it is equally likely that venture capitalists see women as little more than lucrative sources of revenue\u2014as consumers, rather than patients\u2014and that tugging at the fears and anxieties women have about their bodies and life choices can be a strong marketing hook.\n\nBeim, for her part, is earnest about her desire to help women, and forthright about the limits of what she\u2019s been able to accomplish so far. \u201cIs Fertilome, like, \u2018We planted the flag, mission accomplished?\u2019 No,\u201d she told me. The detailed diagnoses and treatments she hopes to offer women are still some ways away, at the very earliest.\n\nYet it\u2019s clear that Silicon Valley startups need not be as mendacious as Theranos to cause harm. Even companies that cast themselves as high-minded can have a detrimental impact on society, as Facebook\u2019s recent scandals illustrate. Tech firms have forged their identities around the idea that they can solve the world\u2019s problems through disruption and innovation, through the amassing of personal data and the achievement of scale\u2014promises that seem increasingly dubious as time wears on and the effects of their products on the real world are revealed. Why would products for women\u2019s health be different?\n\nThe stakes could hardly be higher than they are with fertility. Millions of women who are delaying having children want to know if the gamble they are making\u2014waiting for better circum\u00adstances, without knowing how their fertility will age\u2014will pay off. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the most sensitive topic I can think of: your fertility and your ability to reproduce,\u201d said Levine. Femtech companies have provided avenues for women to discuss their desires, fears, and experiences with friends and doctors, and to combat the stigma associated with infertility. That alone represents a form of empowerment. But even as fertility startups market themselves as sources of clarity and answers, the science still cannot\u2014and may never\u2014say with certainty when, how quickly, or if a woman will get pregnant. Given that reality, it may be challenging for Celmatix and other femtech firms to make good on their promises to women\u2014and live up to their own ideals.\n\n"

    "text": "The arrival of the internet, and Craigslist in particular, was devastating to newspapers and magazines, which had enjoyed a longstanding monopoly on print ads, classified, and otherwise. But this disruption merely accelerated existing trends. Newspapers\u2019 market penetration began a moderate decline after the advent of television in the 1950s, while print circulation began to dip during the Reagan administration, years before the digital revolution.\n\nSurveillance has been the key to the rising dominance of Google and Facebook. The old model could only offer a localized readership: If you were a shoe store in Scranton, Pennsylvania, you would advertise in the Scranton Tribune and hope to reach people looking for new Air Jordans. Today, Google and Facebook can provide detailed information about millions of users, allowing national outlets to micro-target sneakerheads. These sites, as Mathis-Lilley notes, have also become the source of news and information for hundreds of millions of people:\n\n\n\nMoreover, many people now use the two tech giants\u2019 sites/apps as their \u201cfront page\u201d for finding news\u2014all told, for example, Google and Facebook users click links to Slate about 18 million times every month. And the tech giants get to show users ads next to those links, ads that relate to the stories\u2019 subject matter. News sites don\u2019t get a cut of that either, and they can\u2019t bargain for it by threatening to make their sites inaccessible from Google and Facebook because doing so would instantly cut their audiences in half if not more.\n\nThis is a big problem for just about everyone hoping to reach a paying audience\u2014with Facebook and Google essentially taking a finders fee for all online advertising. But it\u2019s especially tricky for news outlets, who struggle to monetize stories that appear in Facebook and Google. Breaking up their ad duopoly would undoubtedly help, as it would add more competition to the online advertising space\u2014though a ban on tracking, and therefore making advertising less efficient, would probably also have to be implemented. This would create a more equitable economic arrangement, but there\u2019s no reason to believe that this alone will solve the journalism industry\u2019s financial woes.\n\nOther changes will be necessary, such as increased regulation of hedge funds and private equity and a commitment of public investment, particularly for local journalism. Some large-scale digital companies like BuzzFeed can make the case to investors that scale will lead to profitability\u2014even if they may be incapable of producing the level of returns that venture capitalists demand. But smaller outlets, especially those tied to a geographic area, face a host of greater hurdles: diminishing readerships, a decline in small businesses (and thus in the advertising base), and the increasing centrality of New York and Washington, D.C., which drain talent and investment from elsewhere.\n\n\n\nLast year, New Jersey took a miniscule step in the right direction, pledging $5 million to fund local news. Facebook and Google have also taken minor, mostly inconsequential steps to boost local reporting: Google\u2019s Bulletin provides crowdsourced news, while Facebook pledged to put more local news into its News Feed. But what\u2019s needed is sweeping reform and an allocation of billions to help fund local reporting. CJR\u2019s Emily Bell has suggested that tech companies spend billions funding journalism, in part as a kind of reparations for the economic harm that they\u2019ve caused. \u201cWhat independent journalism needs more than ever from Silicon Valley is a significant transfer of wealth,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf, instead of scrapping over news initiatives, the four or five leading technology companies could donate $1 billion in endowment each for a new type of engine for independent journalism, it would be more significant a contribution than a thousand scattered initiatives put together.\u201d"

    "text": "In fact, reducing food waste is \u201cone of the most important things we can do to reverse global warming,\u201d according to Chad Frischmann, policy director of the climate solutions group Project Drawdown. In an op-ed for The Washington Post, Frischmann wrote that reducing food waste will ultimately require American consumers to \u201cembrace \u2018ugly food\u2019\u2014fruits and vegetables that are blemished and not perfectly shaped but are perfectly delicious and nutritious.\u201d\n\nMore consumers are doing just that. Founded in 2014, Hungry Harvest was propelled by a $100,000 investment through the popular TV series Shark Tank. It now delivers boxes in six cities on the East Coast, and CEO Evan Lutz says he plans to expand the business \u201cto 30 more cities over the next four years.\u201d Imperfect Produce\u2014founded in 2015 by one of Lutz\u2019s original business partners, Ben Simon\u2014serves 10 West Coast cities, as well as Baltimore and Washington, D.C. Simon envisions Imperfect delivering in \u201call major metropolitan centers on the East Coast by the end of 2020.\u201d NBA superstar Kevin Durant recently announced an investment in the company.\n\n\u201cThe stuff in these boxes is not ending up in a landfill.\u201d\n\nAs these delivery services have grown, though, so have their critics. In an op-ed last year for The New Food Economy, the heads of two food-justice nonprofits in Oakland wrote that Imperfect Produce \u201creflects a very troubling trend ... that commodifies and gentrifies food waste.\u201d The company, they argued, is not in the business of food waste so much food surplus: It buys excess products that farmers can\u2019t sell to supermarkets, but could sell to restaurants, canned and processed food companies, or, as a last resort, donate to food banks. \u201cThe stuff in these boxes is not ending up in a landfill,\u201d co-author Max Cadji, the founder of Phat Beets Produce, told me. \u201cThey\u2019re just tapping into the same marketplace as the guys who make shredded carrots.\u201d\n\nIf the vegetables inside these boxes were never destined for the landfill, then the growth of ugly-produce companies threatens to make the food waste problem worse, according to co-author Eric Holt-Gimenez, the executive director of Food First. The companies, while well-intentioned, are now competing with the other players in the surplus market, incentivizing farmers to overproduce to meet that demand. \u201cThe reason we have so much waste in the first place is because of overproduction,\u201d Holt-Gimenez said. \u201cThis is a way to capitalize on overproduction and increase the flow of waste.\u201d\n\nThe solution to food waste, then, is not to normalize and monetize ugly produce. It\u2019s to create a system where excess food isn\u2019t produced in the first place. How can venture capital-backed companies contribute to that goal when they profit from industrial agriculture\u2019s overproduction? Wouldn\u2019t the growth of these companies, in fact, make the problem worse by providing yet more reason to overproduce?\n\nI put these questions to the founders of Hungry Harvest and Imperfect Produce.\n\n\u201cHonestly, the criticisms are a bit surprising,\u201d Ben Simon said in a 90-minute phone interview last week. Some people might not trust a for-profit, venture capital\u2013backed company to act with the planet\u2019s best intentions in mind, he said, but they should trust the results: In the last three years, Imperfect Produce claims to have saved 30 million pounds of food and 900 million gallons of water from being wasted.\n\nSimon thinks Holt-Gimenez and Cadji are ignoring these positive results, and pointed me to a blog post where he responded to his critics. \u201cWe are saving good produce from rotting on fields, paying hard working farmers a fair price for it, and helping middle and working class people save money on healthy produce,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTo me, calling that \u2018commodifying food waste\u2019 is a gross misrepresentation of the heart of this problem, which is good food not getting eaten, and a negligent dismissal of the climate implications if we don\u2019t do something about it.\u201d\n\nSimon did concede to two points: that Imperfect Produce sources from large-scale industrial producers, like Dole, and that not all of their fruits and vegetables are destined for the landfill. \u201cWe\u2019ve been transparent from the beginning that a small portion of the produce we buy may have had a previous market, and may not have been wasted,\u201d he said, adding that non-wasted food only accounts for about 5 to 10 percent of their products. \u201cIt\u2019s really a minority of it.\u201d\n\nLutz, of Hungry Harvest, said the company also sources from agribusiness, but only sparingly. \u201cI don\u2019t have the exact figure for how much comes from Big Ag, however we define that,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you it\u2019s not a lot.\u201d The average farm the company buys from is under 500 acres, he said, and he insisted that all of the fruits and vegetables in Hungry Harvest boxes would have gone to waste, either by getting thrown out, composted, or left in the field.\n\nBut how does Lutz know that? How can Hungry Harvest promise that a farmer wasn\u2019t going to sell her bruised cucumbers to a different surplus company, or donate it to a food bank? \u201cIt\u2019s based on trust between us and the supplier,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA lot of times our stuff would get left in the field.\u201d\n\nLutz put me in touch with one of those suppliers: Andrew Rose, whose family founded North Carolina\u2019s New Sprout Organic Farms in 2011. Before Hungry Harvest approached the medium-size company in 2016, Rose said, \u201ca lot of times our stuff would get left in the field.\u201d Now, Hungry Harvest has created a market for that surplus\u2014as well as produce that gets rejected by supermarket buyers. For example, Rose said, he recently sent 300 pounds of watermelon radishes to a big grocery store, only to have it sent back because of decay that happened in-transit. \u201cThe first thing we did was call Hungry Harvest,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThe timing was crazy, but we wound up getting 50 cents on the dollar on it, where we wouldn\u2019t have gotten anything on it.\u201d\n\nBut Rose also made a surprising acknowledgement: Not all of the food New Sprout Farms sells to Hungry Harvest was going to waste before the service came along. In most cases, Rose said, \u201cWe donated it to food banks.\u201d New Sprout even received an award from one local food bank in 2012 for donating 85,000 pounds of produce, he said. \u201cWe still donate a lot to food banks\u2014quite a lot,\u201d Rose said. (Manna Food Bank, which gave the award, confirmed they still receive donations from New Sprout). The big difference is that now, \u201cHungry Harvest allows us to offset some of our costs.\u201d\n\nLutz says this offsetting of farmers\u2019 costs is what\u2019s important. \u201cI define the [food waste] problem not as overproduction, but as misallocation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 20 billion pounds of food that go to waste on farms every year, and 41 million Americans who are hungry. That\u2019s a vast misallocation of resources. There should be a way that we can get those people food while helping farmers make money off of it.\u201d Lutz says Hungry Harvest has paved that way. \u201cWe buy that surplus food from farms that they wouldn\u2019t be selling otherwise, sell it to customers, and using those funds, we subsidize donations [to food banks].\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is a compelling argument that ugly-produce companies helps farmers. It does not, however, address the environmental argument: that such companies are incentivizing large-scale agribusiness to continue overproducing. Lutz and Simon could quell these concerns by disclosing all the farms and wholesalers they use, making it possible to fact-check their claims. But neither company will disclose that information.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve explored being transparent about the farms, but some of our farms don\u2019t want to be broadcast for whatever reason,\u201d Lutz said. Simon, meanwhile, claimed producers don\u2019t want their brands to be associated with misshapen goods, adding that it\u2019s not particularly business-savvy to disclose one\u2019s suppliers. \u201cCompetitors would love to know all of our growers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to be competitive as a business.\u201d\n\nCompanies like Hungry Harvest and Imperfect Produce portray themselves as disrupters of a broken food system, but critics say they may actually be disrupting something else: CSAs.\n\nCommunity-supported agriculture programs are, in a way, the original ugly-produce companies. Customers pay for a share in their local farm, usually before the farmer plants anything. The farmer then knows exactly how much to plant. The customer assumes some of the risk\u2014it\u2019s possible that they won\u2019t receive abundant or beautiful produce, depending on the year\u2014while the farmer is financially protected if she suffers a bad harvest. And, of course, it keeps food waste to a minimum.\n\nIn his New Food Economy op-ed, published last August, Cadji claimed that his organization\u2019s CSA had seen a 30 percent drop in customers since Imperfect Produce came to Oakland. When we spoke in December, he said the loss was \u201cprobably closer to 50 or 60 percent.\u201d He can\u2019t prove the decline is because people decided to switch to Imperfect Produce. But CSAs in other cities where Imperfect is thriving are reporting similar wariness to what they see as a fierce market competitor.\n\nCadji also believes Imperfect Produce is doing \u201csneaky little things to undercut CSAs\u201d\u2014like, for example, advertising itself as a \u201cCSA Style Box.\u201d He said this is misleading, and has the potential to lure away potential CSA customers who believe they\u2019re signing up for something similar. Simon, for his part, defended the characterization. Like CSAs, he said, \u201cWe eliminate a step between the grower and households.\u201d\n\nStill, Simon said he doesn\u2019t see CSAs as Imperfect Produce\u2019s main competitor.* Lutz says the same about Hungry Harvest, and even offered proof: a survey the company took of its customer base in August, which found that only 1 in 10 had ever used a food delivery service before. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think our customers are switching from CSAs to us,\u201d he said.\n\nBut how many customers, like me, had signed up because they were searching for a way to solve the environmental epidemic of food waste, and chose Hungry Harvest over a local CSA?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a ton of data on that choice,\u201d Lutz said.\n\nIn the weeks following their New Food Economy op-ed, Cadji and Holt-Gimenez said, they received a lot of support for their critiques. \u201cPeople had never thought about what it meant to tackle the systemic problem of food waste before,\u201d Holt-Gimenez said. At the same time, he added, \u201cA lot of people accused us of having a case of sour grapes. Like, why can\u2019t you just be happy with their success? Why do you have to try and ruin something good?\u201d\n\nThese are legitimate questions, because companies like Hungry Harvest and Imperfect Produce are doing tangible good. They\u2019re giving organic family farms like New Sprout Organic increased financial security. They\u2019re using their proceeds to fight hunger and provide well-paying jobs. They\u2019re challenging grocery stores\u2019 silly aesthetic standards. They\u2019ve prevented millions of pounds of food from going to waste.\n\nBut what if all of these benefits make it harder to achieve an even greater good? Is it worth saving ten million pounds of fruit and vegetables a year if doing so perpetuates their systemic overproduction?\n\nI don\u2019t believe the founders of Imperfect Produce and Hungry Harvest are cravenly exploiting their customers\u2019 do-goodism for financial gain. They seem genuine about wanting to solve one of our most complex environmental problems. But Cadji and Holt-Gimenez\u2019s criticism is valid and necessary. Humanity only has about a decade to take the necessary steps to avoid a climate catastrophe. We need radical, not incremental, solutions\u2014and that includes a complete overhaul of the food system.\n\nThis, ultimately, is why I\u2019m ditching my orange-and-brown box. I became a Hungry Harvest customer because I wanted to do my part to reduce food waste. But I can\u2019t be sure that I\u2019m doing more good than harm. Am I preventing pounds of produce from going to waste, or propping up the very system that I\u2019m trying to help fix? I won\u2019t be haunted by these questions when I get my first delivery from my local CSA.\n\n\n\n* This article has been updated to clarify Simon\u2019s view on CSAs."

    "text": "Ben Terris calls it \u201cPundititis.\u201d Democrats still haven\u2019t recovered from the trauma of Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss to Donald Trump, and it\u2019s causing them to wring their hands about every candidate emerging to challenge him in 2020. So the Washington Post reporter coined this term to describe \u201ca virus affecting the nervous system of Democratic voters that was born out of the 2016 elections. Those infected find themselves unable to fall in love with candidates, instead worrying about what theoretical swing voters may feel. Signs of Pundititis include excessive electoral mapmaking, poll testiness, and an anxious, queasy feeling that comes with picking winners and losers known as \u2018Cillizzasea\u2019\u201d\u2014a dig at Terris\u2019s former colleague.\n\nThis is not an inaccurate diagnosis of the Democrats today. Terris is also right to attribute this malady not only to the results of the last presidential election, but to the mainstream media\u2019s analysis of the emerging Democratic field. Reading much of the punditry of late, one might expect the primary season to be the political equivalent of WWE\u2019s Royal Rumble, a massive free-for-all in which the candidates beat each other to a pulp in a race to the left, leaving one wobbly\u2014and perhaps not very \u201celectable\u201d\u2014candidate standing for Trump to effortlessly defeat.\n\n\n\nFear not, afflicted ones. While Democrats are understandably scarred by 2016, the party has learned its lesson: There will be no coronation this time around, no stark contrast between two candidates representing their respective wings of the party. And while the 2020 primary thus will be crowded, it will be a marked contrast to the \u201cclown car\u201d Republican primary of 2016. For the next year, the Democrats will showcase a party that looks and sounds very different not only from the GOP, but from the Democratic Party of just a few years ago. Rather than a moment of anxiety, this should be a moment of hope and pride\u2014and Republicans should be the ones feeling queasy.\n\nDemocrats are gearing up for a long, contentious primary season. Nine major candidates have already entered the fray\u2014most recently South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, an openly gay 37-year-old military veteran, who announced on Wednesday. By the summer, that number may have ballooned to two dozen or more. That vast field will reflect the Democratic Party in all of its diversity, from ideology to race to sexual orientation to, yes, age. But that has some Democrats nervous that the unfolding contest will distract from the only thing that matters: beating Trump.\n\n"

    "title": "What Jill Abramson Gets Wrong About the Future of Journalism",
    "authors": [
      "Josephine Livingstone"
    ],
    "text": "The Times is an opaque institution and these details are as delicious to read as they are rare. We learn, for example, that Thompson once demanded, over a linen tablecloth luncheon, that she focus on raising cash for the newsroom as well as running it, another breach of church and state. She snapped, \u201cIf that\u2019s what you expect, you have the wrong executive editor.\u201d As she spoke, \u201cthe uniformed waiter serving us spilled the water he was pouring.\u201d\n\nAbramson\u2019s histories of the Times and the Post are careful accounts of how they managed the shift to digital in their operations. For a journalism nerd it\u2019s extremely interesting, since Abramson lets us listen in on what the Sulzbergers say behind closed doors. But there are errors in Merchants of Truth and, as the Twitter firestorms pre-publication indicated, they are chiefly mischaracterizations of young media professionals.\n\nFor example, former Vice reporter Danny Gold tweeted about a \u201clie\u201d he found in Abramson\u2019s book, which remains in the final copy.* She claimed that, \u201cIn a story about an Ebola clinic in Africa, the [Vice] correspondent wore no protective clothing. In contrast, Times correspondents followed the same protocol as doctors (one reporter was herself a doctor), covering every inch of their bodies with protective clothing.\u201d Gold responded that, \u201clike every other reporter there,\u201d he was \u201ctold by experts not to walk around with a PPE [personal protective equipment] unless you were in the ICU.\u201d Furthermore, Gold said, Times reporters were given and followed the same advice. He guessed that Abramson got this \u201cinformation\u201d from a Hamilton Nolan blog post, ignoring an interview Gold himself gave her. She does cite Nolan in many places in the book. (Abramson did not respond to a request for an interview.)\n\nThe other mistakes fall into two overlapping categories: denigrating the credentials of young journalists working for BuzzFeed and Vice and poorly researching their biographies. In one section on BuzzFeed, for example, she describes how \u201cArabelle Sicardi, whose essays on womanhood and self-image packed more substance than most content on the site, was reassigned when her numbers lulled.\u201d But Abramson misses the fact that Sicardi was actually pushed out after writing a post that criticized a BuzzFeed sponsor, Dove, which is a much more relevant and important story. Sicardi also uses the pronouns they/them, easily discoverable online, not she/her.\n\nAbramson has attracted the most ire for a passage about Vice reporter Arielle Duhaime-Ross, whom she referred to in uncorrected proofs as a \u201ctransgender woman.\u201d In the final edition, this has been edited to \u201ca gender nonconforming woman,\u201d but other mistakes remain. Abramson claims that Duhaime-Ross wore blue desert boots, which Duhaime-Ross says were brown, and she misstates the length of the reporter\u2019s hair. More perniciously, Abramson frames these details within a deeply insulting portrait of Vice\u2019s hiring procedure for on-screen reporters: \u201cMost of the on-air talent was very young and had scant experience; only three had ever reported on camera before. What they had was \u2018the look.\u2019 They were diverse: just about every race and ethnicity and straight, gay, queer, and transgender. They were impossibly hip, with interesting hair.\u201d\n\nAbramson claims that Duhaime-Ross had \u201cno background in environmental policy\u201d; in fact, she has a master\u2019s degree in science, health, and environmental reporting, as her website states. She writes of Duhaime-Ross: \u201cBiracial, she identified as black.\u201d She adds, \u201cShe almost missed one of the most important stories on her beat,\u201d about Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord. Duhaime-Ross did not, in fact, almost miss that story. And the detail about her ethnicity reads as an accusation that Duhaime-Ross cynically played the minority for career gain.\n\nIn a recent interview with The New Yorker\u2019s Isaac Chotiner about this incident, Abramson claims that she \u201cmeant no put-down\u201d in this section, and that her point about Duhaime-Ross\u2019s lack of experience was that she seemed \u201centerprising.\u201d \u201cNo one corrected me. The transgender thing was an error,\u201d she said, \u201cand I corrected it for the final book.\u201d\n\nAbramson\u2019s focus on younger journalists\u2019 appearance sticks out like a sore thumb. In one section praising Cory Haik of The Washington Post, for example, she notes that this \u201cnative digerati ... looked perfectly cast for her role as digital innovation czar,\u201d because she had \u201ctwo-tone hair (with a scarlet streak), and wore extremely high heels and cool leopard-print dresses.\u201d Repeatedly, Abramson writes about \u201ccool points\u201d as if they are an influential yet ultimately worthless metric in digital publishing, implying that it leads publications to hire inexperienced journalists. In describing a 2016 BuzzFeed party, for example, she derides its \u201cself-congratulatory levity.\u201d When Vice sent Dennis Rodman to North Korea in 2013, she calls it \u201cscoring cool points like its business depended upon it, which was true.\u201d What of the fact that Rodman gained access where few else had? Is Dennis Rodman \u201ccool,\u201d anyway, and if he is, didn\u2019t Vice prove that \u201ccool\u201d has a function in reporting on North Korea?\n\nThese sections read like Abramson is speaking from a place of ill-informed bitterness over print\u2019s loss of supremacy. They also speak to her failure as an interpreter of how media has changed. When she describes BuzzFeed\u2019s hire of Katie Notopoulos, Abramson writes that she had no background in the news business. While it\u2019s true that Notopoulos did not have a full-time media job prior to her hire, she was well known for her many excellent essays about internet subculture. To me, Notopoulos was a distinguished freelancer; to Abramson, she was a person with an \u201coff-hours hobby.\u201d\n\nAbramson even maligns young Times staffers, writing about \u201cthe more \u2018woke\u2019 staff\u201d who see \u201csocial media feeds as platforms for free exchange, not to be monitored or censored by editors,\u201d the kind of employee who \u201clooked to younger, newer editors like the Style section\u2019s Choire Sicha and the editor of the Times Magazine, Jake Silverstein, for inspiration, rather than to the more distant and older masthead.\u201d It\u2019s abundantly clear what type of journalist she understands and cares about insulting, and which she does not.\n\nUnfortunately, Abramson specifically charges new digital media with a neglect of fact-checking. In a section on Vice\u2019s Thomas Morton reporting in Uganda, for example, she notes that he mistakenly called it the \u201cdrunkest place on earth.\u201d She goes on: \u201cThe assertion fell apart after it was fact-checked, but it wasn\u2019t fact-checked until it was published, and even then the fact-checking was done by an independent journalist who felt it necessary to hold Vice accountable.\u201d\n\nThe irony is thick. Several articles followed the initial Twitter backlash to Abramson\u2019s proofs, decrying the lack of fact-checking in book publishing. In her New Yorker interview, oddly, Abramson explains that the book was actually fact-checked. So how did certain errors make it into the final book? One answer is that Abramson was intent on shoring up a conclusion that she had reached well before she began her reporting: that digital media is sloppy, irreverent, not serious. But another possibility is that some of her statements simply read as false to \u201cus,\u201d by which I mean digital-native writers who have made their careers online.\n\nAbramson\u2019s rudeness to \u201cwoke\u201d writers misses something crucial: the very serious political convictions that inform the work of younger journalists. Empathy for other people, an outspoken concern for gender equality, a recognition of the personal and professional stakes of representation: these are fundamental principles in new digital journalism, not afterthoughts. The misgendering is the perfect example. It\u2019s a generational blind spot for Abramson. It does not occur to her to check pronouns, because among her professional milieu it has not been a priority.\n\nIf Merchants of Truth had focused on the Times and the Post alone, it would have been an excellent contribution to the history of journalism. So why did Abramson step out of her zone of expertise to profile digital media? It\u2019s tempting to see the answer in the circumstances of her own career. If the younger generation suffers from a lack of traditional newsroom training in fairness and ethics and reporting, then the loss of Jill Abramson means something.\n\nOf course, losing her did mean something to many people at the Times. But Abramson\u2019s narrative insists on a meeting of the personal and the historical, when her ouster could more easily be chalked up to factors that are as timeless as they are petty: the machinations of an underling, say, who wants to be king. What we\u2019re left with is half of a great book, and half of a book that recommends to other late-career journalists that they take their inheritors seriously. The digital natives now have loud voices, magnified by the authority of their political convictions. You have to meet change on its level\u2014especially if you\u2019re trying to sell the truth.\n\n*A previous version of this article incorrectly identified Danny Gold as a Vice reporter. He is no longer with the company."

    "title": "Trump\u2019s Cruel Proposal to End the Shutdown",
    "authors": [
      "Matt Ford"
    ],
    "text": "When Senate Republicans published the full legislative text of the proposal on Monday night, it soon became clear that their bargain had no hope of becoming law. Immigration lawyers and experts quickly discovered that the proposal would rewrite the DACA and the TPS programs to water down both their scope and their protections. The bill would also impose onerous new restrictions on some asylum applications that, if enacted, may violate U.S. humanitarian treaty commitments. The bill doesn\u2019t show a way out of the shutdown standoff through compromise and conciliation. If anything, it makes compromise even less likely than before.\n\nTrump\u2019s proposal would create a new form of legal status called \u201cprovisional protected status\u201d for DACA and TPS recipients. The bill would only apply to TPS recipients from four countries: El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Pending expirations for recipients from Nepal and Sudan are still set to lapse without congressional action, while protections for recipients from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone that expired in 2017 won\u2019t be renewed. (Sudan\u2019s status was scheduled to expire last November, but a federal judge ordered that it be kept in effect last October.)\n\n\n\nRather than simply extend the current legal status for DACA and TPS recipients, Trump\u2019s proposal would essentially require them to reapply for it\u2014this time, under legal thresholds normally used for immigrants suspected of marriage fraud. Other parts of the bill appeared to be aimed at dissuading asylum applications in the first place. One unusual provision, for example, would also require TPS recipients to reimburse the federal government for any tax credits they benefited from while living in the United States. Since some TPS recipients have lived in the country for more than a decade, those costs could be a crushing financial burden. David J. Bier, an immigration policy analyst for the Cato Institute, wrote on Twitter that the provision was \u201ctotally unprecedented in the history of immigration law.\u201d\n\nMost of the changes to asylum law focus on Central American minors, a group of applicants whose requests for asylum have drawn the most coverage in recent years. Under current law, anyone seeking asylum can apply regardless of whether or not they entered the country with legal authorization. Trump, hoping to keep asylum-seekers from first entering the U.S., issued an executive order barring applications from those who didn\u2019t present themselves at a port of entry. But a federal judge in California blocked the order from going into effect in November, and the Supreme Court rejected Trump\u2019s request to overturn that injunction in December.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s proposal essentially asks Congress to let it do what the courts won\u2019t allow. A key provision would require Central American minors to submit applications for asylum at U.S. processing centers in their home countries or neighboring ones, thereby undermining the entire premise of the legal right. \u201cAsylum is a form of relief for people who are being persecuted in their home countries and the authorities there are unable or unwilling to protect them (or are the source of the persecution),\u201d Gabriel Malor, a contributor to The Federalist, wrote on Twitter. \u201cYou can\u2019t condition asylum on people remaining in the place where they are persecuted.\u201d\n\n"

    "text": "The Environmental Protection Agency employs about 13,000 people to protect Americans from pollution. Last week, fewer than 900 were working, the rest having been furloughed due to the government shutdown. Among those who reported for duty was Andrew Wheeler, the agency\u2019s acting administrator and President Trump\u2019s nominee to succeed ousted chief Scott Pruitt. \u201cWe are still on the job,\u201d he insisted during his Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday.\n\nWheeler said the EPA is still responding to environmental emergencies\u2014like wildfires in California, which have become a year-round event\u2014and still meeting court-ordered deadlines to make progress on regulations. But there\u2019s so much more the EPA does on a daily basis that is no longer happening, said former EPA regional administrator Judith Enck, who led Region 2 through two shutdowns under President Barack Obama. \u201cScheduled [safety] inspections are not happening. Groundwater data is not being processed. Drinking water sampling is not happening,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is going to be a problem if the shutdown keeps up.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s already a problem. From the halt in monitoring of uranium on the Colorado River and toxic algae in Florida, to the trash overflows and vandalism at national parks across the country, the shutdown is already causing environmental damage. As the Democrats on the Senate\u2019s Environment and Public Works Committee pointed out:\n\nIn Indiana, the #TrumpShutdown is forcing families to wait even longer for information from @EPA about a housing complex with dangerously high lead levels in the soil pic.twitter.com/S1JSbuewge \u2014 EPW Democrats (@EPWDems) January 14, 2019\n\nWheeler acknowledged on Wednesday that some of the EPA\u2019s efforts to protect human health and the environment have been delayed, including a plan to address widespread water contamination by cancer-causing chemicals. But there is far more at stake than what Wheeler described."

    "title": "How to Build a Powerful Protest Movement",
    "authors": [
      "Micah L. Sifry"
    ],
    "text": "With the rise of today\u2019s internet-powered protest movements, some have argued, as Zeynep Tufekci does in her recent book Twitter and Tear Gas, that we need to respect the accomplishment of the 1963 March: Because it was logis\u00adtically a huge lift to organize an event of this scale in the pre-internet age, the activists had to develop strong structures, which then signaled to the authorities that this movement had the capacity to navigate other challenges\u2014like negotiating with the administration over civil rights. And indeed, there was a subtle dance at work between the leaders, who insisted on marching, and the Kennedy White House, which did its best to both embrace the march\u2019s symbolism and contain its substance. Kauffman is making a more subversive claim: that King and his confreres left much of the civil rights movement\u2019s real potential power unmobilized by insisting on such a rigid, top-down, patriarchal approach.\n\nA protester at the Women\u2019s March in January 2017 recreates a popular poster. Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post/Getty\n\nLater generations of activists rebelled against this style of organizing, in the more freewheeling antiwar marches of the 1960s and \u201970s, and in the gay and lesbian rights, women\u2019s rights, and labor rallies of the \u201970s, \u201980s, \u201990s, and \u201900s to the raucous present. Never again has there been a mass march whose marshals so effectively controlled what participants could say; not even the AFL-CIO\u2019s 1981 Solidarity Day rally, which also drew 250,000 people. As Kauffman shows with a wonderful array of well-selected archival photos, today\u2019s protests are do-it-yourself affairs. And with the advent of social media, it\u2019s become impossible to determine which matters more, memes online or posters on the ground, as street protests get amplified in real time by marchers who are simultaneously observing one another and sharing the messages that resonate most.\n\nTo Kauffman, the \u201cbottom-up, women-led\u201d organization of the more than 650 coordinated Women\u2019s Marches in early 2017 \u201cgave them a powerful and unprecedented movement-building impact.\u201d This is a bold claim and one that feels intuitively right. The Women\u2019s Marches laid the groundwork for much of the Resistance organizing of the last two years: Women make up most of the leadership and activist base of Indivisible, which was born in the same postelection moment and now has more than 6,000 local chapters (six times as many as the Tea Party\n\never claimed). And in the buildup to the 2018 elections, 65 percent of the more than 320,000 people who signed up on MobilizeAmerica\u2019s online clearinghouse to canvass for Democratic political candidates were women.\n\nKauffman celebrates the diverse and inclusive approach of the Women\u2019s Marches\u2014reflected both in the intersectional language of the national March\u2019s call and in the millions of homemade signs that participants carried. Indeed, so many people made their own signs for these marches, Kauffman explains, that retailers had trouble keeping up with demand. \u201cIn just the week before people marched around the country, some two million poster boards were sold nationwide,\u201d she notes. The protest wasn\u2019t centralized, but distributed across the country: While about 800,000 people attended the main rally in Washington, D.C., over 1.2 million joined in more than 20 marches in California. Many local march leaders have stayed active; I\u2019ve heard of local groups that formed on the bus ride home from that first D.C. march. The California marches formed a federation and hired an executive director. A coalition of local leaders in more conservative areas formed a parallel group, March On, and organizers of marches outside the United States have formed the Women\u2019s March Global organization.\n\nBut while the on-the-ground truth of the Women\u2019s March movement is that it is leader-full and decentralized, the star-making machinery of American culture, including protest culture, still requires leaders who are supposed to symbolically and literally speak for the movement. This is nearly an impossible role to succeed in, and it has fallen to the movement\u2019s co-chairs Bob Bland, Carmen Perez, Tamika Mallory, and Linda Sarsour to wrestle with its complexity. The 2017 Women\u2019s March started out with Bland and Teresa Shook, who separately posted about the idea of a march in the hours after Trump\u2019s surprise victory. Yet as interest mounted, leaders realized, as they later explained, that the women \u201cwho initially started organizing were almost all white\u201d and that they needed a diverse leadership, not least because the majority of\n\nwhite women voted for Trump. Perez, Mallory and Sarsour\u2014three women of color who were experienced organizers and leaders in causes like criminal justice reform and Muslim-American rights\u2014joined two weeks after Shook\u2019s first post.\n\nThere was poetic and real justice in the Women\u2019s March both continuing the work of the 1963 March, while exploding its model.\n\n\u201cThe naming of the co-chairs,\u201d Kauffman writes, \u201ccreated both direct and symbolic links with the organizing of the 1963 March on Washington.\u201d In particular, Mallory had been a lead organizer of the 50th Anniversary March on Washington in 2013. She contacted King\u2019s daughter Bernice King, and got her permission to rename their emerging effort the \u201cWomen\u2019s March on Washington,\u201d echoing the name of the 1963 protest. So there was poetic and real justice in the Women\u2019s March both continuing the work of the 1963 March, while exploding its model and making space for voices that had earlier been ignored.\n\nAt the same time, in a movement born on Facebook and forged in virtual back channels, the relationship between the national March leaders and its adherents is inherently unstable. The Women\u2019s March has no official membership structure, so it\u2019s unclear to whom its leaders have to be responsive. This is true of many of today\u2019s digitally driven causes, but the fact that the March\u2019s national leaders have more radical politics than many of the middle-class, middle-aged white women in its base only adds to the challenge. Over the past year, Tamika Mallory and Linda Sarsour have, for instance, drawn outsize levels of criticism for statements they have made about Louis Farrakhan and Palestinian rights respectively, with some critics arguing that they are soft on anti-Semitism. This has led one prominent March supporter, actress Alyssa Milano, to withdraw from speaking at the 2019 March, and prompted a fair amount of hand-wringing within local groups about what it means to affiliate with the national March.\n\nKauffman, a veteran observer of and participant in mass movement organizing, skates past the issue of internal decision-making. The story of the marches, she writes, is that \u201cpeople at the grassroots level spontaneously organized themselves, and organizers everywhere were constantly scrambling to keep up.\u201d Again, this is intuitively right, but it\u2019s not a fully satisfying answer either. As the current tensions inside the Women\u2019s March show, decentralized movements still need unified visions and stable brands even if no one wants to go back to the days of volunteer marshals telling people what signs they can wave. The early days of a movement are always messy; there\u2019s a good reason that Nicholas von Hoffman told his mentor Saul Alinsky, the great community organizer, that their methodical ways of building local power didn\u2019t make sense in \u201cthe moment of the whirlwind,\u201d when \u201cwe are no longer organizing but guiding a social movement.\u201d\n\nWe need more in-depth journalism about the movements shaping our times, so we can better understand how such developments really take form. Too much of contemporary coverage consists of desk-jockey commentary and the rehashing of leaders\u2019 official statements, rather than on-the-ground reportage. But for a first draft of history still in the making, Kauffman is right to focus on the broad scale and wide impact of the Women\u2019s Marches of 2017. As she persuasively shows, marches need not be the apex of a movement\u2019s rise; they can also be its generative soil. And while King is still celebrated for his seminal speech, and the 1963 March as the one that created the mold, Septima Clark, and her vision of widespread and inclusive leadership, is the true godmother of the present moment.\n\n"

    "text": "Trump, rather than his party, is taking the brunt of the blame for the shutdown. Close to half of voters blame him specifically, which explains why his approval rating, which typically hovers in the low 40s, may be dipping into the 30s. While the shutdown has been predictably polarizing on the question of the wall itself\u2014Republicans increasingly support it and Democrats increasingly oppose it\u2014key constituencies that helped elect Trump appear to be abandoning him over the shutdown. An NPR/NewsHour/Marist poll released on Wednesday found that the downturn in his approval rating is being driven by dips in support from suburban men and white evangelicals; his approval rating among Republicans, meanwhile, has dropped from 90 to 83 percent. \u201cFor the first time, we saw a fairly consistent pattern of having his base showing evidence of a cracking,\u201d Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Pubic Opinion, told NPR.\n\nThe shutdown is also having an impact on one of the few bright spots of this administration: the economy. Trump cannot take all the credit\u2014though he does, of course\u2014for the strong economy during his first two years in office, as he inherited six consecutive years of growth from President Obama. But there\u2019s no dispute that the Republicans\u2019 $1.5 trillion tax cut in late 2017 supercharged the economy\u2014for a time, anyway. As Bloomberg\u2019s Stephen Gandel wrote earlier this week, the cut is \u201cproving to be vastly more generous for corporate America, and vastly more expensive for taxpayers, than expected. Worse, the Trump Slump is erasing the bump the stock market received from the tax cuts. And evidence is mounting that the promised economic boost isn\u2019t materializing.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump himself is dragging down the economy. His escalating trade war has spooked global markets, and could get much worse soon if an agreement with China is not reached by early March. It has also become clear that the shutdown is having a real impact not just on millions of Americans, but the economy itself. Revised estimates from the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers show the shutdown \u201chas already weighed significantly on growth and could ultimately push the United States economy into a contraction,\u201d the Times reported on Tuesday. Kevin Hassett, the council\u2019s chairman, said \u201cthe impact that we see on government contractors is bigger than the sort of staff rule of thumb anticipated,\u201d and that it\u2019s costing about a tenth of a percent per week in economic growth. As the Times explained, \u201cThat means that the economy has already lost nearly half a percentage point of growth from the four-week shutdown.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no end in sight, either, as Trump refuses to give in on his demand for $5.7 billion for wall construction on the southern border. This has forced Trump\u2019s reelection campaign to reluctantly embrace the shutdown, trying to turn it into the opening salvo of what will surely be a difficult campaign. \u201cThis is a really bad spot for him,\u201d a person \u201cfamiliar\u201d with Trump\u2019s campaign told Politico. \u201cHe may just be fighting because he doesn\u2019t know what the hell else to do.\u201d But what did these people expect? The wall is his core issue, one he made a focal point in both 2016 and 2018. He was always going to make 2020 a referendum on it, too.\n\n\n\nBut the 2020 election will be different from those prior elections in one key respect: America will be in worse shape. When backed against the wall over the past two years, Trump repeatedly has pointed to the economy as proof of his effectiveness. He now seems poised to lose that lifeline, as the economy is expected to cool down and perhaps even enter a recession. Meanwhile, Congress almost certainly will be deadlocked in a brawl. And then there are the wild cards: the trade war with China, the effects of the U.S. withdrawal from Syria (and possibly Afghanistan), and, if the current shutdown ends, another potential impasse over funding the government.\n\n"

    "title": "What Jill Abramson Gets Wrong About the Future of Journalism",
    "authors": [
      "Josephine Livingstone"
    ],
    "text": "The Times is an opaque institution and these details are as delicious to read as they are rare. We learn, for example, that Thompson once demanded, over a linen tablecloth luncheon, that she focus on raising cash for the newsroom as well as running it, another breach of church and state. She snapped, \u201cIf that\u2019s what you expect, you have the wrong executive editor.\u201d As she spoke, \u201cthe uniformed waiter serving us spilled the water he was pouring.\u201d\n\nAbramson\u2019s histories of the Times and the Post are careful accounts of how they managed the shift to digital in their operations. For a journalism nerd it\u2019s extremely interesting, since Abramson lets us listen in on what the Sulzbergers say behind closed doors. But there are errors in Merchants of Truth and, as the Twitter firestorms pre-publication indicated, they are chiefly mischaracterizations of young media professionals.\n\nFor example, former Vice reporter Danny Gold tweeted about a \u201clie\u201d he found in Abramson\u2019s book, which remains in the final copy.* She claimed that, \u201cIn a story about an Ebola clinic in Africa, the [Vice] correspondent wore no protective clothing. In contrast, Times correspondents followed the same protocol as doctors (one reporter was herself a doctor), covering every inch of their bodies with protective clothing.\u201d Gold responded that, \u201clike every other reporter there,\u201d he was \u201ctold by experts not to walk around with a PPE [personal protective equipment] unless you were in the ICU.\u201d Furthermore, Gold said, Times reporters were given and followed the same advice. He guessed that Abramson got this \u201cinformation\u201d from a Hamilton Nolan blog post, ignoring an interview Gold himself gave her. She does cite Nolan in many places in the book. (Abramson did not respond to a request for an interview.)\n\nThe other mistakes fall into two overlapping categories: denigrating the credentials of young journalists working for BuzzFeed and Vice and poorly researching their biographies. In one section on BuzzFeed, for example, she describes how \u201cArabelle Sicardi, whose essays on womanhood and self-image packed more substance than most content on the site, was reassigned when her numbers lulled.\u201d But Abramson misses the fact that Sicardi was actually pushed out after writing a post that criticized a BuzzFeed sponsor, Dove, which is a much more relevant and important story. Sicardi also uses the pronouns they/them, easily discoverable online, not she/her.\n\nAbramson has attracted the most ire for a passage about Vice reporter Arielle Duhaime-Ross, whom she referred to in uncorrected proofs as a \u201ctransgender woman.\u201d In the final edition, this has been edited to \u201ca gender nonconforming woman,\u201d but other mistakes remain. Abramson claims that Duhaime-Ross wore blue desert boots, which Duhaime-Ross says were brown, and she misstates the length of the reporter\u2019s hair. More perniciously, Abramson frames these details within a deeply insulting portrait of Vice\u2019s hiring procedure for on-screen reporters: \u201cMost of the on-air talent was very young and had scant experience; only three had ever reported on camera before. What they had was \u2018the look.\u2019 They were diverse: just about every race and ethnicity and straight, gay, queer, and transgender. They were impossibly hip, with interesting hair.\u201d\n\nAbramson claims that Duhaime-Ross had \u201cno background in environmental policy\u201d; in fact, she has a master\u2019s degree in science, health, and environmental reporting, as her website states. She writes of Duhaime-Ross: \u201cBiracial, she identified as black.\u201d She adds, \u201cShe almost missed one of the most important stories on her beat,\u201d about Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord. Duhaime-Ross did not, in fact, almost miss that story. And the detail about her ethnicity reads as an accusation that Duhaime-Ross cynically played the minority for career gain.\n\nIn a recent interview with The New Yorker\u2019s Isaac Chotiner about this incident, Abramson claims that she \u201cmeant no put-down\u201d in this section, and that her point about Duhaime-Ross\u2019s lack of experience was that she seemed \u201centerprising.\u201d \u201cNo one corrected me. The transgender thing was an error,\u201d she said, \u201cand I corrected it for the final book.\u201d\n\nAbramson\u2019s focus on younger journalists\u2019 appearance sticks out like a sore thumb. In one section praising Cory Haik of The Washington Post, for example, she notes that this \u201cnative digerati ... looked perfectly cast for her role as digital innovation czar,\u201d because she had \u201ctwo-tone hair (with a scarlet streak), and wore extremely high heels and cool leopard-print dresses.\u201d Repeatedly, Abramson writes about \u201ccool points\u201d as if they are an influential yet ultimately worthless metric in digital publishing, implying that it leads publications to hire inexperienced journalists. In describing a 2016 BuzzFeed party, for example, she derides its \u201cself-congratulatory levity.\u201d When Vice sent Dennis Rodman to North Korea in 2013, she calls it \u201cscoring cool points like its business depended upon it, which was true.\u201d What of the fact that Rodman gained access where few else had? Is Dennis Rodman \u201ccool,\u201d anyway, and if he is, didn\u2019t Vice prove that \u201ccool\u201d has a function in reporting on North Korea?\n\nThese sections read like Abramson is speaking from a place of ill-informed bitterness over print\u2019s loss of supremacy. They also speak to her failure as an interpreter of how media has changed. When she describes BuzzFeed\u2019s hire of Katie Notopoulos, Abramson writes that she had no background in the news business. While it\u2019s true that Notopoulos did not have a full-time media job prior to her hire, she was well known for her many excellent essays about internet subculture. To me, Notopoulos was a distinguished freelancer; to Abramson, she was a person with an \u201coff-hours hobby.\u201d\n\nAbramson even maligns young Times staffers, writing about \u201cthe more \u2018woke\u2019 staff\u201d who see \u201csocial media feeds as platforms for free exchange, not to be monitored or censored by editors,\u201d the kind of employee who \u201clooked to younger, newer editors like the Style section\u2019s Choire Sicha and the editor of the Times Magazine, Jake Silverstein, for inspiration, rather than to the more distant and older masthead.\u201d It\u2019s abundantly clear what type of journalist she understands and cares about insulting, and which she does not.\n\nUnfortunately, Abramson specifically charges new digital media with a neglect of fact-checking. In a section on Vice\u2019s Thomas Morton reporting in Uganda, for example, she notes that he mistakenly called it the \u201cdrunkest place on earth.\u201d She goes on: \u201cThe assertion fell apart after it was fact-checked, but it wasn\u2019t fact-checked until it was published, and even then the fact-checking was done by an independent journalist who felt it necessary to hold Vice accountable.\u201d\n\nThe irony is thick. Several articles followed the initial Twitter backlash to Abramson\u2019s proofs, decrying the lack of fact-checking in book publishing. In her New Yorker interview, oddly, Abramson explains that the book was actually fact-checked. So how did certain errors make it into the final book? One answer is that Abramson was intent on shoring up a conclusion that she had reached well before she began her reporting: that digital media is sloppy, irreverent, not serious. But another possibility is that some of her statements simply read as false to \u201cus,\u201d by which I mean digital-native writers who have made their careers online.\n\nAbramson\u2019s rudeness to \u201cwoke\u201d writers misses something crucial: the very serious political convictions that inform the work of younger journalists. Empathy for other people, an outspoken concern for gender equality, a recognition of the personal and professional stakes of representation: these are fundamental principles in new digital journalism, not afterthoughts. The misgendering is the perfect example. It\u2019s a generational blind spot for Abramson. It does not occur to her to check pronouns, because among her professional milieu it has not been a priority.\n\nIf Merchants of Truth had focused on the Times and the Post alone, it would have been an excellent contribution to the history of journalism. So why did Abramson step out of her zone of expertise to profile digital media? It\u2019s tempting to see the answer in the circumstances of her own career. If the younger generation suffers from a lack of traditional newsroom training in fairness and ethics and reporting, then the loss of Jill Abramson means something.\n\nOf course, losing her did mean something to many people at the Times. But Abramson\u2019s narrative insists on a meeting of the personal and the historical, when her ouster could more easily be chalked up to factors that are as timeless as they are petty: the machinations of an underling, say, who wants to be king. What we\u2019re left with is half of a great book, and half of a book that recommends to other late-career journalists that they take their inheritors seriously. The digital natives now have loud voices, magnified by the authority of their political convictions. You have to meet change on its level\u2014especially if you\u2019re trying to sell the truth.\n\n*A previous version of this article incorrectly identified Danny Gold as a Vice reporter. He is no longer with the company."

    "text": "Since the shutdown began 33 days ago, Pelosi has repeatedly stood up to Trump. She has brushed aside his proposals to reopen the government as \u201cnonstarters\u201d because of his insistence on $5.7 billion for the border wall, which she calls \u201can immorality.\u201d She has pressured him to postpone the State of the Union, scheduled for next Tuesday, over shutdown-related security concerns, which may force him to hold the event elsewhere. She has also largely kept Schumer, who has been criticized by many Democrats for his willingness to work with Republicans, in lockstep. Pelosi had deferred to Schumer during Trump\u2019s first two years in office, but a top Democrat told Politico \u201cthe dynamic is changing.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmericans like what they\u2019re seeing from her. New polling shows that Pelosi\u2019s popularity has jumped. According to polling from Civiqs, Pelosi\u2019s favorability has jumped 13 points among Democrats, from 59 to 72 percent. \u201cIt appears, then, that Pelosi\u2019s opposition to the president has rallied her party\u2019s base and increased her favorability ratings,\u201d argued The Washington Post\u2019s Michael Tesler. But it\u2019s not just Democrats who approve of her performance during the shutdown. As a CBS News poll released on Wednesday found, \u201cAmong Americans overall, and including independents, more want to see Mr. Trump give up wall funding than prefer the congressional Democrats agree to wall funding. Comparably more Americans feel House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is handling negotiations better than the president is so far.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are winning the shutdown thus far because they haven\u2019t compromised\u2014and they have no reason to do so, given the unpopularity of the president and the border wall. The length and severity of this shutdown, now the longest in U.S. history, could do lasting damage to Trump\u2019s presidency. If so, we may be witnessing the pinnacle of Pelosi\u2019s career. She had already proven herself as a resolute obstructionist when she thwarted George W. Bush\u2019s plan to privatize Social Security in 2005. In 2009 and 2010, she proved herself a master legislator when she passed Obamacare, which she helped resuscitate, and the (ultimately doomed) cap-and-trade bill. But given the stakes of the current political moment, the character of the president, and the criticism she has fielded over the past year, her recent performance against Trump will change the story that\u2019s told about her in history books.\n\nLooking ahead to 2020, progressives may yet have reason to be skeptical about Pelosi\u2019s continued hold on the gavel\u2014especially if Democrats win back both the presidency and the Senate. She has, especially recently, shown herself to be cautious when confronting the progressive wing\u2019s increasingly ambitious agenda. She implemented a pay-go rule in the House, requiring new spending to be offset by budget cuts or tax increases. On Medicare for All, she has largely advocated for strengthening Obamacare, but did recently allow hearings on universal health care to go forward. As for Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal, Pelosi does not seem to be a fan: Earlier this year, she rebuffed the freshman\u2019s attempt to form a committee on the proposal. Finally, while she has advocated for younger leaders, she has tended to privilege corporate-friendly centrists like Hakeem Jeffries over progressives like Barbara Lee.\n\n\n\nBut 2020 is a long way off, and Democrats\u2019 unified control of the government may be an even longer way off. For now, by undercutting and emasculating Trump at every turn, Pelosi is determined to turn the shutdown into the beginning of the end of his presidency. In doing so, she has earned the loyalty of her entire caucus. Winning tends to have that effect.\n\n"

    "title": "Why Is Greece Such a Hot Spot of Left-Wing Terrorism?",
    "authors": [
      "Sarah Souli"
    ],
    "text": "Unlike the groups of the 1980s, the new terror groups that emerged in the mid-aughts lack any ideological vision and are more careless, analysts say. On the bright side, the preference for low-intensity violence and IEDs \u201canyone is capable of fabricating\u201d (as one SPF manifesto boasted) means fewer deaths. \u201cIt\u2019s really easy to kill people if you want, so the good news is that they don\u2019t want to\u2014because they have no political message to convey by killing,\u201d says Kiesling. Unlike clear and accessible communiques by other far-leftist groups, like The Coming Insurrection by France\u2019s Invisible Committee, available statements by today\u2019s Greek terrorist groups are deliberately open-ended, often rambling, pseudo-intellectual, and designed for a very small, like-minded audience.\n\nBut while less lethal, the attacks are also less targeted. Many small bomb attacks are so-called initiation, or recruitment bombs, by new members eager to show off their revolutionary chops and bomb-making skills. The Kolonaki church bomb was a recruit bomb and was likely placed by an individual who had a personal vendetta against the church. Earlier this month, a bomb went off outside a butcher shop in the working-class neighborhood of Kypseli. It was apparently an animal rights statement, but it severely injured a passerby.\n\n\n\n\n\nNor are the groups uniformly low-tech: They have years of training and a decentralized power structure, which has led to enhanced operational capacities as well as access to military-grade weapons, often bought through organized-crime ties forged partly through the prison system. In Greece, there isn\u2019t a separate prison facility for individuals charged with terrorist-related activity. Instead, members of N17, SPF, and other groups are housed in the country\u2019s biggest maximum-security prison, Korydallos. Within EU countries, left-wing terrorist offences get an average of ten years jail time\u2014significantly more than the average five for jihadist offences, or four for right-wing terrorist offences. In Greece, it\u2019s even higher. According to Europol, the average prison sentence for a left-wing terrorist is 17 years.\n\nOutside of prison, groups congregate in the anarchist-stronghold of Exarchia, a so-called \u2018no-go zone\u2019 that serves as a recruitment ground, cache for weapons, bomb-building, and safe house location.\n\nThe mystery of Greek left-wing terrorism, however, is that it persists at all. Fewer than 400 terrorists operate within the country, according to Michaletos, among a population of around eleven million that possesses the third-highest ratio of police officers to civilians worldwide. After the assassination of Welch, the CIA poured millions of dollars into counter-terrorism and training operations in Greece; U.S. financial support continues. \u201cGreece is a small country,\u201d says Bossis. \u201cIt\u2019s not very difficult [for] the authorities...to know who these people are, to understand them in depth, and to solve the problem.\u201d\n\nRegardless of whether a left-leaning party, like the current ruling Syriza, or a center-right party, like the main opposition New Democracy, is in charge, left-wing political violence continues. \u201cWhat is lacking is political will,\u201d says Michaletos. The right accuses the left of inaction; the left accuses the right of political exploitation.\n\nDistorting the discussion of left-wing terror in Greece is an uncomfortable reality, as a much more immediate and tangible threat comes from right-wing violence. Racist hate crimes in Greece tripled in 2017, impacting more people than left-wing terrorism. The state has proved woefully slow to address this, too: A trial of 69 members of the far-right political party Golden Dawn, for various criminal activities including racial violence and murder, that began in 2015 drags on to this day, with lawyers in the trial having been attacked by right-wing gangs. Ultimately, Greece faces an issue in checking extremist political violence across the spectrum. A bloated, inefficient, and selectively violent police force hasn\u2019t responded effectively to extremism. 2019 is an election year for Greece, but it\u2019s unlikely that attacks on either the left or the right will abate by the time Greeks head to the polls in the fall."

      "Matt Ford"
    ],
    "text": "When Senate Republicans published the full legislative text of the proposal on Monday night, it soon became clear that their bargain had no hope of becoming law. Immigration lawyers and experts quickly discovered that the proposal would rewrite the DACA and the TPS programs to water down both their scope and their protections. The bill would also impose onerous new restrictions on some asylum applications that, if enacted, may violate U.S. humanitarian treaty commitments. The bill doesn\u2019t show a way out of the shutdown standoff through compromise and conciliation. If anything, it makes compromise even less likely than before.\n\nTrump\u2019s proposal would create a new form of legal status called \u201cprovisional protected status\u201d for DACA and TPS recipients. The bill would only apply to TPS recipients from four countries: El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Pending expirations for recipients from Nepal and Sudan are still set to lapse without congressional action, while protections for recipients from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone that expired in 2017 won\u2019t be renewed. (Sudan\u2019s status was scheduled to expire last November, but a federal judge ordered that it be kept in effect last October.)\n\n\n\nRather than simply extend the current legal status for DACA and TPS recipients, Trump\u2019s proposal would essentially require them to reapply for it\u2014this time, under legal thresholds normally used for immigrants suspected of marriage fraud. Other parts of the bill appeared to be aimed at dissuading asylum applications in the first place. One unusual provision, for example, would also require TPS recipients to reimburse the federal government for any tax credits they benefited from while living in the United States. Since some TPS recipients have lived in the country for more than a decade, those costs could be a crushing financial burden. David J. Bier, an immigration policy analyst for the Cato Institute, wrote on Twitter that the provision was \u201ctotally unprecedented in the history of immigration law.\u201d\n\nMost of the changes to asylum law focus on Central American minors, a group of applicants whose requests for asylum have drawn the most coverage in recent years. Under current law, anyone seeking asylum can apply regardless of whether or not they entered the country with legal authorization. Trump, hoping to keep asylum-seekers from first entering the U.S., issued an executive order barring applications from those who didn\u2019t present themselves at a port of entry. But a federal judge in California blocked the order from going into effect in November, and the Supreme Court rejected Trump\u2019s request to overturn that injunction in December.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s proposal essentially asks Congress to let it do what the courts won\u2019t allow. A key provision would require Central American minors to submit applications for asylum at U.S. processing centers in their home countries or neighboring ones, thereby undermining the entire premise of the legal right. \u201cAsylum is a form of relief for people who are being persecuted in their home countries and the authorities there are unable or unwilling to protect them (or are the source of the persecution),\u201d Gabriel Malor, a contributor to The Federalist, wrote on Twitter. \u201cYou can\u2019t condition asylum on people remaining in the place where they are persecuted.\u201d\n\n"

    "text": "Beijing started out projecting confidence. \u201cChina has a lot of experience in taming a new American president, and Trump should be no exception,\u201d an editorial in the Chinese edition of the Global Times confidently affirmed, belying any initial shock at the billionaire\u2019s victory. \u201cChina is used to dealing with businessmen, and in this way, he may be easier to handle than Hillary,\u201d claimed Jin Canrong, a high-profile international relations professor.\n\nOnly in recent months has the tone changed. By some accounts bewildered, Chinese officials now affect admiration. \u201cI have just spent a week in Beijing talking to officials and intellectuals, many of whom are awed by his skill as a strategist and tactician,\u201d wrote Mark Leonard in the Financial Times in July 2018, amidst the impact of the tariff contest. Although it\u2019s possible, even likely, officials were feeding remarks intended to inveigle Trump (even depicting him, for example, as a \u201cSun Tzu-like strategic genius\u201d), he has genuine admirers among their ranks. Some Chinese buy into the \u201csuccessful businessman\u201d blather, and see a pragmatic venerable elder\u2014something he would have to be to have survived in China\u2014rather than an aging grifter, as he is more usually seen in the West.\n\nMao delighted in turmoil, urging his base to unleash havoc at mass rallies.\n\nAt 72, Trump, after all, is only two years older than the People\u2019s Republic will be in October; none of its leaders could have successfully endured his repeated humiliations, bankruptcies, or public exposures without being arrested or disappeared. It\u2019s widely believed, for example, that the country\u2019s youngest billionaire, 42-year-old Jack Ma, did not volunteer his own resignation as CEO of e-commerce giant Alibaba last summer, but privately accepted it. As overseer of both a vast Amazon-like structure, and digital payment network, Ma was close to commanding an enterprise larger than his own government, and arguably too rich to jail. Trump\u2019s dogged survival skills may impress those for whom politics and business is more literally a life-or-death daily struggle.\n\nIf China\u2019s negotiators truly have arrived at a state of puzzled esteem (a debatable thesis, as Trump\u2019s thirst for flattery has become an international punchline at this point), it may also have something to do with disillusionment at his opponent: Xi\u2019s star does not shine as brightly as it once did. The days when the General Secretary could make a speech at the UN about women\u2019s rights, or laud free markets at Davos, and the media would broadly sing along, have petered out. The once and future reformist, strongman, and free-market debutante seems diminished, even if no one in his circle or society is telling him so. His lack of momentum is the source of an entire system encompassing many careers and institutes: the Xi Jinping Thought industry, dedicated to analyzing the Chinese leader\u2019s \u201chodgepodge of Dengist and Maoist terminology\u201d and \u201cvague ideas,\u201d as The Economist once summed it up, into submission\u2014or at least something resembling an ideology.\n\nTrump\u2019s popularity with certain Chinese elites is likely to make Xi more paranoid than ever. Like other PRC leaders, Xi is largely insulated from public opinion, and seemed barely able to field even a single question without losing composure at the only foreign press conference he\u2019s ever assented to, in 2014. PRC politics is opaque by design, with Xi\u2019s dogma and rhetoric boring all but the most dedicated observers into disinterest. American politics is, by contrast, a smorgasbord of openly competing interests, with rapidly shifting dynamics. Trump exults in the office, but detests the responsibilities; Xi, meanwhile, is minutely obsessed with controlling all aspects of governance. Trump courts attention, and is perpetually aghast at seeing his inadequacies paraded by the press; Xi crushes critics, then demands their adulation.\n\nWhen Bush lost his dinner in 1992, his Japanese hosts discreetly declined to air any footage on public television. Now, the overseas-facing English-language Twitter for People\u2019s Daily Online openly trolls Trump. \u201cOne by one,\u201d the account tweeted with a smiley face, upon news of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke\u2019s departure from the Trump administration.\n\nXi\u2019s personality of cult and centralization of power has caused many to compare him to Mao. In fact, Xi\u2019s obsession with order bears little resemblance to Mao, who ruled through division, turning lieutenants upon lieutenants, purging rivals. Mao delighted in turmoil, urging his base to unleash havoc at mass rallies. \u201cAll under heaven is in chaos,\u201d his motto ran. \u201cThe situation is excellent.\u201d Of today\u2019s leaders, the one who most closely hews to this playbook is not Mao\u2019s successor, but his American rival."

    "text": "The greatest obstacle, however, may be the Senate itself. Like the Electoral College, the chamber has a structural rural bias that lends Republicans disproportionate power. But Mitch McConnell\u2019s reign over the chamber has also showed how it can be a mortal threat to basic governance. The Kentucky senator, who proudly declared that his top goal after the 2008 election was to make sure Obama would be a one-term president, often rejected policy negotiations with Democrats so he could blame Obama for the resulting dysfunction. His iron grip on the Senate\u2019s flow of business amid the current shutdown shows how Republicans\u2019 structural advantage in one legislative chamber gives them an undemocratic veto on the country\u2019s political agenda.\n\n\n\nSome observers have also proposed scrapping the legislative filibuster, which would reduce the need for Democrats to obtain buy-ins on major legislation from conservative members and moderate Republicans. Some 2020 contenders like Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand have also backed statehood for the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Creating two new states would strengthen democracy in both places and dilute the Republicans\u2019 structural advantage in the Senate. But there\u2019s also no reason to stop there: full statehood for American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands would also be a good idea if those territories desire it.\n\nBritish lawmakers used a similar maneuver to bring their upper legislative chamber to heel in the early twentieth century. David Lloyd George, the Liberal Party\u2019s chancellor of the exchequer, first introduced what became known as the \u201cPeople\u2019s Budget\u201d in 1909. It proposed a vast expansion of the nation\u2019s social safety net that would be financed itself through aggressive tax hikes on landowners and the wealthiest British citizens. The House of Lords\u2019 members naturally refused to pass a budget that would tax themselves so heavily, even after the Liberals had won another general election and a clear popular mandate for it. What began as a policy dispute had become a constitutional crisis.\n\nLloyd George found a radical solution. With King George V\u2019s support, he threatened to elevate hundreds of new Liberal dukes, viscounts, and barons to take control of the House of Lords and pass reforms that would strip away the Lords\u2019 ability to block legislation. The aristocracy backed down in 1910 and approved the budget, but Lloyd George and the Commons persisted in forcing them to accept the Parliament Act the following year, which replaced the Lords\u2019 ability to vote down legislation with the power to delay it for two years. Creating a dozen new Senate seats out of territories long deprived of influence in Congress seems almost tame by comparison.\n\nAs dramatic as it may sound, there is abundant precedent for reshaping the Senate\u2019s balance of power through new states. Early American statesmen regularly used the creation of free and slave states to maintain the political equilibrium between the North and the South before the Civil War. When Southern senators withdrew from the Senate to join the rebellion in 1860, the Republican Party suddenly found itself able to pass a wave of stymied legislation: land-grant colleges, a transcontinental railroad, the first federal income tax, and more. Statehood also bypasses the unique obstacle of Article V of the Constitution, which forbids the ratification of amendments that alter any state\u2019s \u201cequal representation\u201d in the Senate unless the state itself consents to the changes.\n\nBold political reforms often went hand-in-hand with social and economic reforms throughout American history. Radical Republicans and black freedpeople fought to build a multiracial democracy in the South and ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, laying the groundwork for future civil rights triumphs. Reformers in the Progressive Era passed universal suffrage for women and mandated the direct election of senators. The 1950s and 1960s saw the end of poll taxes and literacy tests, the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the establishment of the \u201cone man, one vote\u201d principle by the Supreme Court.\n\nBut progressives today have given short shrift to potential structural changes to the American political system. At the same time, Republicans haven\u2019t been shy about using their political power over the past decade to mold the nation\u2019s political structures in their favor, whether through aggressive partisan gerrymandering, a wave of restrictive voting laws, or refusing to let Obama change the Supreme Court\u2019s ideological balance. These successes have made it even more difficult for Democrats to capture and hold the House, the Senate, and the presidency simultaneously. But when they do, in 2020 or later, they have to be ready to use the opportunity to untilt the balance of power. Because they may not get another one."

(Perhaps, like some Democrats, they\u2019re afraid that Ocasio-Cortez might scold them on Twitter.) Speaking on background, though, some said the letter did not allow for enough flexibility on the details of a Green New Deal\u2014such as one section promising that all signatories will \u201cvigorously oppose\u201d a deal that includes \u201cmarket-based mechanisms and technology options such as carbon and emissions trading and offsets, carbon capture and storage, nuclear power, waste-to-energy and biomass energy.\u201d\n\nDominique Browning, the co-founder of Mom\u2019s Clean Air Force, wasn\u2019t shy about putting her criticisms on the record. She noted that the letter characterized market-based solutions to climate change\u2014such as carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems\u2014as \u201ccorporate schemes that place profits over community burdens and benefits.\u201d This can be true, Browning said, but \u201cequity and environmental integrity factors could be built into those mechanisms.\u201d\n\nBrowning also took issue with the letter\u2019s rejection of \u201ccarbon capture and storage,\u201d the technology that removes greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and stores them\u2014either in concrete blocks, or deep underground. Yes, she said, the technology is unproven and not cost-effective\u2014for now. \u201cWhy at this point would we shut off research and development into any possible technological solution that might get us out of this mess?\u201d she asked. \u201cWho knows yet what will be the answer, or answers?\u201d\n\n\n\nSome non-signatories sought to draw a distinction between their groups and the groups that signed the letter. Andrea McGimsey of Environment America\u2014which advocates for federal environmental policy changes, in part by lobbying\u2014said that she and her organization \u201cwholeheartedly support the [letter\u2019s] call for 100 percent renewable energy.\u201d But, she added, \u201cMuch of the rest of the plan is outside our lane.\u201d Jake Thompson, a spokesperson for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the group was supportive of the \u201cexciting momentum behind a new grassroots call to arms, embodied in part by initiatives like the emerging Green New Deal.\u201d\n\nBut for other non-signatories, the issue seemed that they simply aren\u2019t ready to commit to what must\u2014and must not\u2014be in the Green New Deal. \u201cWe are working collaboratively with a wide array of groups\u2014including many of those on this letter\u2014plus frontline communities and members of Congress to develop bold Green New Deal policies that can tackle the climate crisis, create high paying jobs, and counteract racial and economic inequity at the speed and scale that justice demands,\u201d Ben Beachy, the director of Sierra Club\u2019s Living Economy campaign, said in an emailed statement. \u201cBuilding a more inclusive economy requires an inclusive process.\u201d"

    "text": "The effect on society of these skillful overtures is nowhere more strikingly confirmed than in the belief, still nearly universal among blacks and whites alike, that King and his allies were \u201cmoderates\u201d of the black protest movement, while critics like Malcolm X were implacably \u201cmilitant\u201d scourges of American society. It is true that Malcolm brilliantly articulated black anger, castigated whites as \u201cdevils,\u201d and ridiculed civil rights activities such as the 1963 \u201cfarce on Washington.\u201d Yet his consuming cynicism afforded no outlet for challenging the social order beyond vague talk of a distant racial apocalypse. Like others on the extremes of black nationalism, he left segregation intact and, in general, substituted stridency for political strategy. The real militants were King and his fellow activists, who shook whole cities with mass demonstrations, demanded and secured sweeping changes in federal law, and reshaped the political agenda of two strong-minded chief executives. Like earlier protest groups, they proved that within the bounds of America\u2019s political system there were possibilities for dissent, pressure, and change.\n\nAs civil rights leaders continued to blend moral appeals with mounting protests, they succeeded in mobilizing public support for reform. In the wake of the Birmingham campaign. President Kennedy (who previously had tried to dissuade King from further demonstrations) called for comprehensive civil rights legislation. He also admonished Americans that they could no longer be content to say that their country had \u201cno ghettos, no class or caste system, no master race except with respect to Negroes.\u201d Kennedy\u2019s successor, Lyndon Johnson, made civil rights the centerpiece of his liberal reform program, and in July 1964 Congress passed an omnibus measure that barred discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and voting, and tied federal aid to education to the desegregation of schools. In 1965 public outcries over violence in Selma led President Johnson to seize the moment for a televised address before a Joint Session of Congress. Requesting new legislation to vanquish racism, he also echoed the hymn made famous by civil rights workers, proclaiming, \u201cAnd we shall\u2014overcome!\u201d Six months later a strong Voting Rights Act passed Congress by better than a four-to-one margin in both houses. Diehard racists still found champions like Alabama\u2019s Governor George Wallace, who pledged to defend \u201csegregation today, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever!\u201d But under the insistent prodding of black demonstrators and spokesmen like Dr. King, most Americans resolved that in the matter of legalized discrimination, it was indeed past time to overcome.\n\nFollowing these dramatic victories, the reform coalition that King had helped to shape suddenly faltered. The nation\u2019s deepening involvement in Vietnam diverted funds from domestic concerns, while King\u2019s criticisms of the war as immoral alienated both President Johnson and conservative black spokesmen in the N.A.A.C.P. and the Urban League. Black unity further eroded as King\u2019s exhortations to nonviolent protest were increasingly drowned out by cries of \u201cBlack Power!\u201d At the same time, a growing focus by black leaders on de facto segregation in the ghettos disconcerted many northern liberals who had viewed civil rights as a sectional product for export to the needy, sinful South. The spread of ghetto riots hastened the reform coalition\u2019s demise amid a wave of conservative demands for \u201claw and order.\u201d Though some black extremists hailed the riots as a \u201crevolutionary statement,\u201d they were tragic in their destructiveness and politically counterproductive: filled with sound and fury, signifying Nixon.\n\nThe assassination of Martin Luther King, on April 4, 1968, deprived blacks of their ablest spokesman. His death, soon followed by the murder of Robert Kennedy, deepened the despair of reformers who saw the promise of social change shot down in a cross fire of senseless violence and political reaction. Theirs was a bitter journey from naive optimism to unmixed cynicism; in a year from Selma to Watts, in a decade from Camelot to San Clemente. For all the risks by vulnerable marchers, for all the energy and idealism, what had the protest movement that King symbolized really achieved?\n\nIn retrospect it is clear that the more expansive hopes for civil rights reform were markedly inflated. Residential segregation, seen in the persistence of black inner-city ghettos and nearly lily-white suburbs, has easily survived federal fiats against housing discrimination. De facto segregation of churches, social centers, and private schools also remains routine, suggesting that in important respects the society\u2019s newfound emphasis on interracial harmony has been more rhetorical than real. Black political power is still embryonic with respect to national office holding and participation in the circles that shape foreign and domestic policy. As for economic progress, it has scarcely touched the black urban poor, whose continued desperation marks the most severe limitation of the civil rights movement.\n\nToday, even by the spartan thresholds set by the federal government, one in three blacks lives in poverty. As in 1960, black median income is barely more than half that of white families, and the black unemployment rate continues to hover at more than twice the national percentage. This can be attributed in part to a rise in single-parent, female-headed black households from one-fifth of all black families in 1960 to nearly one-half today\u2014a disastrous pattern in a society where such families, regardless of race, are twice as likely to be poor as two-parent families. But the \u201cfeminization of poverty\u201d does not fully account for the plight of ghetto residents. The jobless rate for black males 16 or older is 45 percent, and for black youth it is 55 percent. In all, the roots of racial inequality were too deeply embedded in centuries of American history to be washed away by the purifying rains of a decade\u2019s liberal reform.\n\nStill, if the protest movement King represented is judged by the distance it traveled rather than by barriers yet to be crossed, a record of substantial achievement unfolds. In communities throughout the South, \u201cwhites only\u201d signs that had stood for generations suddenly came down from hotels, restaurants, theaters, and other facilities. Court-ordered desegregation of schools quickened its pace and by the mid-1970s had become fact as well as law in over 80 percent of all southern public schools. There are now federal penalties for overt discrimination in employment, and gains in college education and professional training have led to an increase in the black middle class. Perhaps above all, black protest brought new respect for Afro-Americans, breaking forever the comfortable myth that they were contented with a bi-racial society and proving that they had the rare courage needed to challenge it.\n\nIn the South, black protest transformed the racial mores of an entire region, a change particularly evident in the tenor of its political life. Politicians quickly jettisoned their tested appeals to prejudice, learned to pronounce \u201cNegro\u201d in place of more casual epithets, and prefaced the names of newly valued black constituents with the once forbidden appellation \u201cMister.\u201d Even the past master of race baiting, George Wallace, was struck color blind on the road to Montgomery in his recent gubernatorial campaign. Wallace, who like most politicians believed above all in winning elections today, tomorrow, and forever, spent much of his hard-fought contest kissing black babies and humbly supplicating their parents\u2019 support, assuring them of his reborn attitudes on race matters. Whatever Wallace\u2019s deepest sentiments, his actions were a striking testament to the legacy of the civil rights protests he once vowed to crush, but which instead have left an indelible imprint on the nation\u2019s moral landscape.\n\nAlthough King\u2019s vaunted place in civil rights history is assured, the meaning of his leadership to Americans today is less clear. Last year\u2019s March on Washington, organized by the King family, attempted to revive his reform vision, symbolized by his inspirational cry at the first march twenty years ago, \u201ci have a dream today!\u201d Yet while the event attracted a wider range of groups than the march in 1963 (including contingents of Hispanics, gays, and women), no cohesive social movement was in evidence. The original march was notable for the way its chief organizer. Bayard Rustin, fused its many participating groups into a disciplined lobby for two overriding goals; enactment of the civil rights bill pending in Congress and, secondarily, a federal jobs program. By contrast, the quality of diversity was strained at the recent march, in which a host of otherwise disparate placards and speeches all exalted \u201cthe dream,\u201d more as a substitute than a shorthand for a set of political priorities. King\u2019s name was continuously invoked, and one speaker imitated his manner in a recital aptly called \u201cEchoes of Martin Luther King,\u201d The tributes were fitting, yet in the absence of a clear political agenda, they underscored that the dominant mood at this gathering for bold reform was nostalgia.\n\nAmong current leaders seeking to extend Martin Luther King\u2019s legacy, by far the most influential and best known is his former aide, Jesse Jackson. Jackson\u2019s Presidential campaign, marked by special attention to minorities and the poor, has sparked voter registration, and this in turn should enhance black influence in national politics. Jackson is also among the few leaders who approach King\u2019s charisma in addressing both blacks and whites. Yet his candidacy should give pause to even the most ardent civil rights advocates.\n\nIt is not simply that Jackson\u2019s character is suspect in view of his false claims to have cradled the dying Reverend King in Memphis. Nor is the problem merely one of questionable judgment, as in 1979 when he embraced P.L.O. leader Yasir Arafat, whose idea of \u201cWe shall overcome\u201d might reasonably be considered somewhere over the rainbow coalition\u2019s moral limits. Beyond these shortcomings, there is the fact that Jackson\u2019s popular rhyming jingles have been rather bolder and more inventive than any of his specific ideas about aiding the disadvantaged. To date, his isolated criticisms of welfare have not greatly distinguished his candidacy from those of other major party figures of the left or right. In all, Jackson may have donned the mantle of Dr. King, but the garment fits so loosely as to leave its personal and political contours nearly unrecognizable.\n\nIn what direction, then, does King\u2019s legacy point for the current generation of Americans who have enshrined his name? Admittedly the question of what King might have done\u2014as with any figure capable of dramatic growth, from the Kennedys to Malcolm X\u2014must remain a matter for speculation. It is clear, though, that civil rights laws did not nearly exhaust King\u2019s interest in social change. The flaring of ghetto riots persuaded him that the nonviolent protest movement had to shift its focus to aid the mass of ghetto blacks who still lived in economic misery. His increasing activity in the northern ghettos after 1965 also accompanied growing doubts about the social consequences of capitalism. Although he continued to reject communism because it denied individual liberty. King also criticized capitalist economies, which he felt \u201coften left a gulf between superfluous wealth and abject poverty.\u201d Increasingly, therefore, he came to view the reforms of the early \u201860s as only a first step toward curbing disparities of wealth and opportunity in a society still ridden by caste distinctions.\n\nThough King by no means resolved the complex technical disputes over how government programs could best aid the poor, he contributed a lucid moral viewpoint in asserting that this cause should command the nation\u2019s highest priority. Lamenting the \u201cfragmentary and spasmodic\u201d reforms that \u201chave failed to reach down to the profoundest needs of the poor,\u201d he insisted that the federal government either ensure full employment or provide guaranteed incomes \u201cpegged to the median income of society, not at the lowest levels.\u201d In his final months. King was planning a Poor People\u2019s March on Washington to focus public attention on his call for \u201cthe total, direct, and immediate abolition of poverty.\u201d\n\nAnticipating fierce resistance to appeals for a radical redistribution of national wealth. King believed that protests might need to reach a higher level of mass civil disobedience. He noted approvingly that \u201cto dislocate the functioning of a city without destroying it can be more effective than a riot because it can be longer-lasting, costly to the larger society, but not wantonly destructive.\u201d Such protests. King hoped, would \u201ctransmute the deep rage of the ghetto into a constructive and creative force.\u201d It meant, as well, a shift away from reliance on federal good will, in favor of new tactics \u201cto compel unwilling authorities to yield to the mandates of justice,\u201d\n\nDespite these ominous signals. King still sought a consensus for nonviolent change, and toward that end he presented his urgent demands to end poverty as consistent with national interests and values. Such a program, he claimed, would strengthen the economy by raising consumer purchasing power and enlarging the labor force. King also believed that the issue could attract an interracial coalition, since two-thirds of the nation\u2019s poor were white. Finally, he termed the elimination of poverty a moral necessity \u201cif democracy is to have breadth of meaning.\u201d By such efforts to temper protest with conciliation. King advanced the cause of the poor, not only as a man who had a dream, but as one who could then go tell it on the mountain of American democratic myth.\n\nIn all, the nation\u2019s first commemoration of King\u2019s life invites not only celebration, but also sober cerebration over his\u2014and the country\u2019s\u2014unfinished tasks. These remain as formidable as in his lifetime, though it was a mark of King\u2019s leadership to discern possibilities for reform equal to every test. Unsparing in his criticisms of the country, he nonetheless believed that \u201cAmerica, the richest and most powerful of nations, can well lead the way\u201d to a \u201crevolution of values\u201d that would ensure a decent life for all people. In that faith, he shared his dream of a just society while realizing that this ideal still existed, to a challenging degree, only in the realm of his moral imagination.\n\nRobert Weisbrot, a Fellow of the Du Bois Institute at Harvard University and assistant professor of history at Colby College, is the author of Father Divine and the Struggle for Racial Equality (University of Illinois Press).

Last week, fewer than 900 were working, the rest having been furloughed due to the government shutdown. Among those who reported for duty was Andrew Wheeler, the agency\u2019s acting administrator and President Trump\u2019s nominee to succeed ousted chief Scott Pruitt. \u201cWe are still on the job,\u201d he insisted during his Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday.\n\nWheeler said the EPA is still responding to environmental emergencies\u2014like wildfires in California, which have become a year-round event\u2014and still meeting court-ordered deadlines to make progress on regulations. But there\u2019s so much more the EPA does on a daily basis that is no longer happening, said former EPA regional administrator Judith Enck, who led Region 2 through two shutdowns under President Barack Obama. \u201cScheduled [safety] inspections are not happening.

Drinking water sampling is not happening,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is going to be a problem if the shutdown keeps up.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s already a problem. From the halt in monitoring of uranium on the Colorado River and toxic algae in Florida, to the trash overflows and vandalism at national parks across the country, the shutdown is already causing environmental damage.

    "text": "A young person coming of age in the last few generations, particularly if she or he is black, may have seen more images of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. than anyone, even if we count depictions of Jesus Christ. They would have seen his image adorning cheaply framed portraits above a mantle or the old church calendars that hung in a grandmother\u2019s kitchen, browning from age as they stayed affixed to the refrigerator long past December due to pride. (You see the same thing happening to a lot of Obama photos in black homes today.)\n\nKing\u2019s soft, fleshy face, either painted with a celestial glow or photographed in black and white, was often depicted looking off into the distance as if in reflection or mourning. We\u2019d see that face move in familiar footage that typically went into heavy rotation right around this time of year, especially with the inevitable broadcast of his 1963 speech at the March on Washington. We\u2019d sit rapt, our voices exhausted by the singing of \u201cLift Ev\u2019ry Voice and Sing\u201d and \u201cWe Shall Overcome\u201d at our church commemorations, and we\u2019d listen. Hearing about his dream again would be as if we were taking up a New Year\u2019s resolution anew every January to end racism. Once the commemoration of his birthday was first observed as a holiday, King not only became more image than man. He became ritualized.\n\n\n\nThe same as Jesus, King is often celebrated incompletely. Princeton professor Eddie Glaude, speaking Sunday at the WNYC MLK Day event at Harlem\u2019s Apollo Theater, referred to those who might \u201cempty his radical witness.\u201d Even as contemporary historians and artists such as Michael Eric Dyson and Ava DuVernay have offered fuller pictures of King the human being in recent years, our nation\u2019s Eurocentric historical narratives continue to do their work to a man who was, in his time, one of the foremost threats to structural racism and inequality. Our rituals, while comforting and inspiring, lulled the American public into a lionization of a complicated man whose advocacy for economic justice and labor\u2014and against war\u2014are not always part of the story. As long as King\u2019s radicalism stays missing from our remembrances, it will be easier for people to lay claim to his story\u2014even people who oppose everything King actually stood for.\n\nOne group of young leaders used this holiday weekend to adopt the King tradition in full. The Black Youth Project 100, a Chicago-based movement collective that trains and mobilizes activists between the ages of 18 and 35, staged #ReclaimMLK actions in several cities. The protests, per BYP100 digital strategist Fresco Steeze, aimed to \u201cbuild a narrative that when we want to celebrate radical history, movement history, we don\u2019t have to have this cookie-cutter narrative that America wants us to have for our black movement leaders. We can celebrate the fact that they fought.\u201d The actions, Steeze said, were also in coordination with the forthcoming release of their new Agenda to Build Black Futures, an economic-justice document advocating for reparations, worker\u2019s rights, divestment from policing and prisons, and workplace protections for women and trans employees."

    "text": "The difficulty with that campaign was not rooted in its perception of the problem, but in its strategy and tactics. It had been relatively easy to rally blacks to abolish, with the help of the federal judicial system, segregationist laws that subjected them daily to humiliation and intimidation. It was another thing to motivate people to march for jobs, for training, and for economic justice, none of which could be legislated by the stroke of a pen or the taking down of \u201cColored Only\u201d signs. For example, trade unions needed to spend millions of dollars to organize workers to stand up for their economic interests. Unlike the struggle against segregation, the struggle for economic equity would require huge resources and a national consensus to spend billions of dollars essential to address the problems of the poor.\n\nWhat King cold not have foreseen is that this nation is creating what will be, in the next 20 years, millions of economic untouchables. These are men and women who will never work, for whom there will be no work, and whom society will regard as something less than human. In Western industrial societies, one is defined largely by one\u2019s work. Mrs. Jones on welfare is a non-person in the eyes of society, and as a result she is likely to see herself as such.\n\nUnable to find work and stripped of their humanity in relation to society at large, the underclass then faces the additional onus of latent racism rising to the surface. Ironically, this development comes at a time when the changing nature of the economy has hurt a growing segment of Americans of all races. Under these circumstances, racial conflict is all the more tragic, since the victimizers have more in common with their victims. The unemployed white teenager in Queens and the unemployed black youth in Harlem should be natural allies, not enemies. Neither the dispossessed farmer, nor the laid-off white factory worker in Detroit, nor the idle black steelworker in Pittsburgh can improve his or her condition without recognizing that they all must join in a common struggle.\n\nThe old form of racism was based on prejudging all blacks as somehow inherently undeserving of equal treatment. What makes the new form more insidious is its basis in observed sociological data. The new racist equates the pathology of the poor with race, ignoring the fact that family dissolution, teenage pregnancy, illegitimacy, alcohol and drug abuse, street crime, and idleness are universal problems of the poor. They exist wherever there is economic dislocation and deterioration--in the cities, for example, dotting Britain\u2019s devastated industrial north. They are rampant among the white jobless in Liverpool as well as among unemployed blacks in New York, And if the American underclass seems more violent, it is only because we, as a nation, are more violent.\n\nThe new forms of racism cannot be attacked frontally. Society will not combat the new racism, as has been naively suggested in the press, by asking people to be good or asking teachers to teach new courses on tolerance. Nor can it be attacked by adopting the strategy and tactics used so effectively by King in the 1960s.\n\nTo combat bigotry and injustice today requires an analysis of structural changes in the economy that have contributed to the growth of the poor underclass, and a national agenda to address the ramifications of these changes. The technological revolution, automation, cybernation, and robots have taken jobs away from the poor and uneducated. And though some of these innovations create work, they do not create work for those without skills or, worse, those unable to attain them. Labor-intensive industries, which were prime vehicles for economic advancement for generations of white immigrants and black former slaves, have gone overseas, never to return.\n\nTo honor King we must look ahead, beyond the racial equality dream, to economic equity. It must be remembered that the civil rights King struggled for did not cost the American public one penny. Nor did it cost the American people anything to permit blacks to go to universities with equality, or into theaters and hotels, or to have the right to vote. Even the much maligned Great Society programs of the Johnson era were relatively inexpensive given the robustness of the economy at the time.\n\nBy contrast, the second phase of the revolution envisioned by King will require billions of dollars. But they are not dollars that will be spent on an exclusively black agenda. Continuing black economic progress and equal opportunity are not contingent on the government providing \u201cspecial treatment\u201d to blacks. Any preferential approach postulated along racial, ethnic, religious, or sexual lines will only disrupt a multicultural society and lead to a backlash. However, special treatment can be provided to those who have been exploited or denied opportunities if solutions are predicated along class lines, precisely because all religious, ethnic, and racial groups have a depressed class who would benefit.\n\nBlack economic progress is contingent upon the national economy performing well for all Americans. That can only happen if the federal government commits billions in resources to a comprehensive program that addresses this nation\u2019s deteriorating economic position and the erosion of education and research and development. We need a national commitment to excellence in education and to federal vocational and job-training programs to help blacks and others enter an increasingly specialized and competitive job market, and to move on to new jobs when technological innovation eliminates old jobs. Those who argue that such programs would be expensive must realize that for every one million people unemployed, the cost to the United States is a staggering $24 billion annually in lost federal taxes.\n\nThere must also be a national commitment to formulate and implement a strategy for reducing poverty and easing the suffering of the underclass. We must accept the obvious fact that there are many among the poor who are psychologically unequipped to deal with the harsh realities of making it in society, but these people cannot be simply dismissed or left to wander the streets. And we must accept that the programs will be costly. In the long term, however, they will be less expensive for society than keeping people in jails, mental institutions, and drug rehabilitation centers.\n\nFinally, there must be a national commitment to safeguarding civil rights and anti-discrimination regulations that have been indispensable to social and economic progress for blacks, women, Hispanics, and other minorities. The Reagan administration is zealously seeking to roll back many of the gains King gave his life to achieve.\n\nIf we truly want to honor King, we must bear in mind the basic lessons he taught us. First, we must avoid polarization. King helped win the battle against segregation because he forged a general consensus based on the notion that its elimination was in the interest of all Americans, Today\u2019s struggle must be based on a non-racial program for economic justice that would facilitate the formation of coalitions based on mutual need. Second, King realized that the government will never bring about social change without the manifestation of a national will for change. And finally. King never lost sight of his immediate purpose: the abolition of racist laws barring blacks from normal participation in mainstream society. Even as the tactics to achieve economic equity have, by necessity, shifted from protest to politics, even as the struggle has moved out of the streets into the corporate boardrooms and national political organizations, these fundamental principles of the King legacy remain an integral part of the struggle.\n\nBayard Rustin is president of the A. Philip Randolph Educational Fund. This article was adapted from a speech delivered at Harvard University Chapel on January 19."

    "text": "Questions of identity dissolve in the insecurities of race. It is well to remember that King lived nearly his entire life calling himself a Negro instead of a black man. The very name of his race was in flux, and for most of his years the personal attributes of Negroes were virtually invisible within the white culture. He forced himself upon the world as a political issue. During his lifetime there was little appetite or conditioning to absorb more about him.\n\nRelatively few blacks and practically no whites ever knew, for instance, that King was anything but a champion among his fellow black Baptist preachers in the huge six million-member National Baptist Convention. This was the center of King\u2019s church heritage, where both his father and grandfather had achieved national reputations. The convention\u2019s annual meetings were advertised as the largest gatherings of black people under one roof anywhere in the world--up to 20,000 preachers, deacons, choristers, and laymen from the richest and most powerful institution of the black culture, meeting in an atmosphere crossed between that of a giant synod and a national political convention.\n\nWhen King and his civil rights forces moved to take over the convention at Kansas City in 1961, they were repulsed in an ugly riot during which one preacher was killed. The victorious conservative president blamed King publicly for the riot, threw the power of the organized church against most of King\u2019s civil rights initiatives, and remained in power another 20 years, long enough to support Ronald Reagan for president. King, effectively accused of murder and excommunicated from his own national church, withdrew from the convention for the remainder of his life. This bitter experience blocked his career ambitions as a churchman and drove him toward the unpleasant conclusion that a majority of his peers never would embrace his nonviolent resistance. Within a new months he went to Albany, Georgia--alone, without the legion of Convention Baptists he had hoped to marshal--and was swept up in his first sustained campaign of civil disobedience to the segregation laws.\n\nNone of this registered in public. One might have expected the segregation press to trumpet the news that King was implicated in the violent and shameful debacle, and that his fellow black preachers rejected his plans for integration. The chasm between the races was so wide, however, that the shattering conflict at Kansas City was a silent event to the white world, which made a habit of noticing King only when he could not be avoided. Unfamiliarity and discomfort blotted out the texture of King\u2019s life amid black preachers, among many other central aspects of his personality.\n\nYet when a Justice Department official simply offered him an automobile ride in the autumn of 1963, a front-page scandal erupted over charges of government favoritism for black leaders. The sensitivities of race exposed King to bizarre disparities of perception. His political genius lay in his strength to maintain balanced judgment under constant bombardment from a wide range of forces--J. Edgar Hoover, the conservative Baptist incumbent, King\u2019s contentious aides, his conscience, his bitter rivals within the civil rights movement. Southern governors, condemned prisoners appealing for his help\u2014always knowing that his every deed and statement might be magnified or reduced a thousand times by the trick mirrors of race. Similarly, his gift as an orator lay in his ability to deliver the same speech in a way that would move both urban sophisticates who wanted to hear about Camus and unlettered church folk who wanted to hear about the furniture in heaven.\n\nNow we are beginning to fashion a holiday mythology based on images that covered the cocoon of King\u2019s life. Almost inevitably, he is being celebrated for his achievements as they registered in the majority culture--for his great marches and civil rights laws, and for the Nobel Peace Prize. He is seen as the epitome of black success, rising from utter obscurity to the heights of international acclaim: just as Lincoln overcame his log cabin origins, so King conquered the limitations of racism. Like all myths, these contain truth, but in King\u2019s case they threaten to distort the inner progression of his life and to rob the new holiday of its true meaning. To celebrate King as the paramount black political symbol makes him a brittle icon--a counterpart to Britain\u2019s Prince Charles. From the core of King\u2019s religious belief to the edge of his political triumphs, his life was about status and human pride, but by his own lights the story ran counter to most of the King mythology.\n\nThe young King is generally portrayed as a well-educated but conventional Southern Baptist minister, whose transformation into a man of stature began suddenly when the Montgomery bus boycott made him a celebrity in national race politics. In fact, by inheritance and oratorical gifts. King was a prince within his national church long before the 1955 boycott. While still a student, he established a reputation that brought him invitations to preach in the largest black churches--New York congregations claiming up to 10,000 members. When he left college to attend a Pennsylvania seminary in 1948, he was the only member of his integrated class wealthy enough to support himself without at least part-time work.\n\nUntil midway through his career. King remained something of a dandy. He wore expensive clothes, savored the opera, and dabbled at golf. He never gave up dramatic late entrances and other showmanship techniques of a master preacher, and he was accomplished in the formal etiquette--reminiscent of Renaissance court diplomacy--by which his preacher\u2019s fraternity managed and divided clerical prerogatives. Congregations ceremoniously presented him and his colleagues with wooden gift boxes stuffed with cash; special tributes to the ministers lasted hours. The preacher was a monarch, cut to the figure of Moses.\n\nKing embodied this role at the same time he rebelled against it. From the beginning he warned against the special temptations of success among a status-hungry people, denouncing the predilection of his fellow preachers for long Cadillacs. As glory fountained up beneath him, these harsh warnings from his own personal theology loomed ever larger in his life. He preached that privileged people require special discipline to be at peace with justice. His wife recalled that \u201c\u201dhis conscience fairly devoured him\u201d\n\nBy family training he was extremely sensitive to shadings of his public image, which he labored adeptly to manage. In the 1950s he maneuvered to become the first black civil rights leader to meet with Eisenhower, and his 1964 trip to visit the pope was at least partly a promotional tour, conceived in awareness that the Norwegian Parliament was considering him for the Nobel Prize. He had given up his fanciest clothes, however, and nearly all his money. He never bought a Cadillac. Within minutes of hearing he would receive the prize, he announced that he would give the $250,000 purse to the movement. By then jealousy was poisoning some of his dearest friendships, and he knew that FBI officials were working diligently to blackmail or disgrace him with intercepted evidence of his extramarital affairs. King pledged to give them up--but failed. These personal ordeals, though central to the furnace of his character, did not change the direction of his public record. He returned from Oslo almost directly to the jails of Selma, Alabama, to begin the campaign for the Voting Rights Act, which transformed American politics by enfranchising black citizens in the rural South.\n\nThere followed the three years that foreshadowed the surly mood of American politics after his death. The most influential civil rights leaders repudiated his protest against the war in Vietnam. The editors of Life called his first major Vietnam speech \u201ca demagogic slander that sounded like a script for Radio Hanoi.\u201d Meanwhile, the spirit of his movement disintegrated amid riots, repression, and the surge of black pride. Black opinion leaders began to speak of nonviolence, and of King, with condescension. White intellectuals ignored him as a tediously religious Uncle Tom. His literary agent sent word that New York publishers expressed no interest in a new book by King on any subject. King kept moving away from the \u201cmountaintop\u201d of Oslo. While other aspiring leaders of both races kept clamoring for their moments in the White House, King stopped going at all. \u201cHe\u2019s canceled two engagements with me, and I don\u2019t understand it,\u201d President Johnson complained in a private memo. At the end, King was not in the company of white presidents or black elites, but marching with the garbagemen of Memphis.\n\nHe had the driven energy to help lift a people to a new identity and position of respect, and in the process he acquired what is commonly regarded as the highest honor in the Western world. This is the storybook side of King, which has its place. But the more revealing side lies in his determination to reclaim the common level of humanity. He resisted not just the expectation but the insistent demands of his peers that he allow himself to be feted and toasted as a symbol of hard-earned prestige. Instead, he pushed his way back down to jail, to now battles that left him nearly a pariah, and finally to the garbage strike in Memphis. The proud young doctor forged a prophet\u2019s humility out of his determination to leave behind what he called \u201ca committed life.\u201d This downward thrust makes him a transcendent figure rather than merely a romantic one. In this respect, it is a disquieting sign that the official literature for the new King holiday seldom mentions the crucible years after he won the Nobel Prize.\n\nInescapably, the meaning of King\u2019s life springs from religion as much as politics. Born into a culture in which the pulpit was the key to riches as well as salvation, he struggled with religion as preachers\u2019 kids often do, having grown up privy to both the trade secrets of the business and its claim to ultimate reality. His religious beliefs never were orthodox. Ho studied at a seminary teeming with freethinking professors who doubted, for instance, the existence of the historical Moses--on the ground that no Moses character had been located in Egyptian or Persian texts covering that era. King adapted to such skepticism more readily than most of his classmates, because he was searching for an honest way to recover from a prolonged spell of blanket disbelief. In particular, ho was troubled by liberal theology\u2019s answer to the age-old problem of reconciling the idea of God with the presence of evil in the world. Ho rejected the progressive notion that intellectual and scientific progress could steadily reduce evil, and thereby the need to explain it. Although such an outlook was ascribed almost automatically to King and Social Gospel crusaders, be stubbornly refused to believe that education or comfort made people loss sinful. On the contrary, he thought these attainments fed the central moral sin of pride.\n\nNot until late in his studies did King find a way to join his yearning for justice in the world to an idea of God in the universe. He fixed upon the theory that from human self-centeredness comes an ingrained capacity for \u201cenemy thinking,\u201d or self-justifying moral codes. These accommodate the removal or blotting out of people, as in racial segregation. In extreme form they can invert morality altogether, as when the most heinous sins of ordinary life become the sacred duty of soldiers, Klansmen, or terrorists. King merely resolved that it was possible, by supreme acts of faith and human will, to combat enemy thinking without falling prey to it, to affirm that \u201cthe arm of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\u201d By such efforts, he sought to uphold the existence of God. Far from being a comfortable or conventional theology, this was nearly a desperate one, linking King\u2019s personal religious doubts not only to the plight of his race but also to the fate of the bomb-threatened globe.\n\nFor years before and after his famous \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech of 1963, King identified the American dream with Jefferson\u2019s familiar credo from the Declaration of Independence: \u201cAll men are created equal ... endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights.\u201d He praised the passage for its universalism, and then he praised it also for \u201csomething else\u201d at its center \u201csomething ultimately distinguishes democracy from systems of government which make the state an end within itself.\u201d The dream, he said, \u201caffirms that there are certain basic rights that are neither conferred by nor derived from the state.\u201d This idea was dear to him. He interpreted it to mean that religion and democratic politics are united in their purest essences and yearnings, beneath all the imperfections of doctrine. The politician should acknowledge a mission derived from the spirit, not from worldliness. The preacher should be out in the world defending the endowments of the creator. And the individualism inherent in the rights--\u201dlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\u201d--embraced both the personalism of King\u2019s own religious belief and the freedom-dream of his politics.\n\nKing\u2019s version of the dream had nothing to do with the rise of prestige or windfall riches. Indeed, he sought to reclaim the sacredness of free human character in a country he saw as glutted with wealth and power. His deity was a personal God whose benevolence could be believed, communicated--even demonstrated--as when his crowds responded to the cry of his favorite prophet, Amos, to \u201clet judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream!\u201d This was the spirit of the civil rights movement, which lived in the bottomless passion of his speeches.\n\nTime can narcotize even national holidays, turning cherished historical moments into sale-a-thons, binges, highway casualty statistics. Still, holidays are among a nation\u2019s fundamental traditions. Like hidden blood vessels, they carry life sources so vital to a culture that we can be oblivious to their meaning until crisis or inspiration flushes it scarlet to the surface. Arbitrarily, to mark and measure the passage of time, we have fixed the new year upon a certain day in early winter, in a celebration dating from Roman sacrifices to the two-faced God Janus. Almost as arbitrarily, a church council in what call the fourth century selected December 25 as the birth date for Jesus of Nazareth, and for 16 centuries since then the Christmas birthday celebration has stood handsomely among the winter festivals of the world\u2019s major religions.\n\nKing\u2019s holiday is yet a blink against these swaths of time, but already it stands out among the nation\u2019s permanent landmarks. With the holiday calendar and the monument grounds of the capital city filling toward capacity, it appears that during its formative two centuries the government of the United States constructed three major political monuments--to Washington, to Jefferson, and to Lincoln. Most of Washington\u2019s parks and traffic circles are named for military leaders of the Civil War era. The six House and Senate office buildings are named for 20th century legislators of modest historical resonance--Cannon, Longworth, Raybum, Russell, Dirksen, and Hart. And among the eight purely American holidays, beyond the two imported from the ancient Mediterranean, King\u2019s birthday alone stands in honor of a preacher, a Ph.D., a black man, and a martyr who was wiretapped and reviled by officials of the same government that elevated him.\n\nKing never held or sought public office, but he shaped more sweeping political change than any politician or private citizen of his era. He did not live out the American dream, as is obvious from his short, tormented biography. But for his age he did reinterpret the nation\u2019s precious freedoms along the edge between religion and politics, where the country was founded. For this he earned his holiday.\n\nA glance around the country--from the liberated, resurgent South to the faces in mayors\u2019 seats, office buildings, television shows, and even college sports arenas--confirms the magnitude of the transformation wrought by King and his movement. We are that much further from South Africa. A glance there, or to the Middle East, or to eruptions of race hatred in Philadelphia and other cities, confirms that a renewal of that spirit could not be wasted.\n\nThis is what the holiday is for. King was a black leader but never a parochial one. The boundless vision of his message touched people far beyond his camp and sowed changes more profound than political accommodation. Ed Bethune, a little-known, last-term congressman, brought a small sign of it to the floor of the House of Representatives. \u201cMr. Speaker, as a Republican and a former FBI agent, I rise in strong support of the Martin Luther King holiday bill,\u201d be said. After describing the travail of the civil rights movement in his home state of Arkansas, he continued: \u201cAnd do you know what we learned out of all that? The great changes are not made here in the legislative chambers or in the judicial halls. The great changes in this world are made in the hearts and minds of men and women. Attitudes are so important. I think that this holiday for Martin Luther King will give us an annual opportunity to recommit ourselves to the proposition that all men are created equal. It will nourish the spirit of reconciliation that we need so desperately in this country right now.\u201d"

    "text": "There are easier ways to get to Montgomery. The massed power of the army, the national guard, state troopers, and the Justice Department does not lessen the sun\u2019s glare or the force of thunderstorms. The pavement along the 50 miles of the U.S. 80 from Selma is just as hard on the feet, and the muddy campsites just as cold and disagreeable for all the complex battle plans of the marchers and their protectors. By Tuesday, when even the television cameramen began to lose interest, the march had been transformed from a carnival for 3,000 to a crusade for 300. That night, a Presbyterian clergyman\u2014one of the few whites left in the column\u2014leaned against the clay caked tailgate of a farm truck and picked at a cold pork chop. \u201cThis,\u201d he smiled, \u201cis our finest hour.\u201d\n\nWhatever the original point of the march\u2014and it has been lost in the events of the last few weeks\u2014the most immediate significance is for the marchers themselves. The young Dallas County Negroes who walk singing freedom songs confirm their commitment to the movement as their fathers and older brothers never did. The thousands of whites who have come to Selma from the North will never, of course, be the same.\n\nWhen the Selma campaign started two months ago, Brown\u2019s Chapel AME Church was a black citadel; now it is the most thoroughly integrated place in the South. At the Saturday night meeting before the march, there were more white faces than black, and Andy Young, one of the best of Martin Luther King\u2019s organizers, told the outside agitators that they were being taught as much as they were teaching. \u201cYou can\u2019t live with us down here without understanding poverty. We could have put you up in fancy motels [they couldn\u2019t] but we wanted you to see how we live. We wanted you to live in Negroes\u2019 homes and see the poverty of our lives. Because before we get out of this movement, we\u2019ll have another one going up North.\u201d For the first time in the lives of most of the whites, a Negro ghetto was their home, and when they walked through it at night they were among friends. If they ventured into the white center of town or the residential areas, they were in enemy territory.\n\n\u201cThis is not a spectacle; it\u2019s a pilgrimage,\u201d Andy Young said, but as the marchers flooded over the Petus Bridge Sunday morning, the scene owed more to Cecil B. De Mille than to Saint James of Compostela. It was a kind of instant history, like \u201cYou Are There\u201d on the radio, and everyone tried hard to feel it: Two Negro Nobel Peace Prize winners walking hand in hand down an Alabama highway, the majesty of the federal government protecting a ragged band of revolutionaries, the radical change the civil rights movement was effecting in the country."

The disbelieving individual in question is Oren Aks of Jerry Media, the marketing firm that promoted Fyre Festival, the stupidest disaster in the annals of millennial hubris. He\u2019s right; there are. Hulu dropped its documentary about the ill-fated festival on Monday, gazumping a Netflix documentary on the same subject slated for release on January 18. Having seen both, the winner of the contest is clear: It\u2019s Hulu, thanks to its exclusive interviews with Billy McFarland, the dodgy entrepreneur who oversaw the whole fiasco. It also does a better job pointing out the secret villain of this story all along: the subtle menace of social media marketing.\n\nThe background is this: McFarland, who first rose to notoriety as the proprietor of Magnises, the credit card\u2013meets\u2013social club startup, dreamed up a celebrities-for-rent app called Fyre. The idea was that regular people could pay famous people to hang out with them. Ja Rule was on board as a partner, and the app was valued highly. McFarland and Ja Rule then tried to promote the app through a luxury music festival in the Bahamas in the spring of 2017. Due to horrendously poor organization and a cash flow problem that escalated into wire fraud, the event was a catastrophe.\n\nHigh-paying customers were met with sodden mattresses in FEMA tents, rather than the opulent villas they were promised. There was zero entertainment, when performances by Blink-182 and others had been advertised. Pictures of sad cheese sandwiches in styrofoam containers soon spread across the internet, delighting those who had been wise enough not to be taken in by dreams of a \u201cyacht brunch party\u201d on the island of Great Exuma.\n\nThe victims in the fraud weren\u2019t the wealthy consumers, really, but the local workers who were promised a lucrative, recurring annual event. As one caterer put it in Netflix\u2019s Fyre, \u201cThey had every living soul on the island of Exuma who could lift a towel, working.\u201d McFarland wrung out this island for all it was worth, then never cut the checks."

    "text": "A few weeks after President Donald Trump moved into the White House, he received a memo from one of his biggest campaign donors: Robert Murray, the CEO of Murray Energy, America\u2019s largest private coal company. Emblazoned with the words \u201cAction Plan,\u201d it was essentially a wish list of all the environmental regulations Murray wanted Trump to get rid of.\n\n\n\nNearly two years later, Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency is on track to fulfill almost all of Murray\u2019s requests. And the Senate is on the cusp of allowing one of Murray\u2019s most trusted former lobbyists to lead the effort.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works held a confirmation hearing for Andrew Wheeler, Trump\u2019s nominee to run the Environmental Protection Agency. Wheeler has been effectively running the agency as acting administrator since July, when Scott Pruitt resigned amid a deluge of ethical scandals. But Trump only formally nominated Wheeler to lead the EPA last week, triggering a confirmation process that Democrats are using to shine light on an unsavory fact: As a lobbyist for Faegre Baker Daniels, Wheeler earned more than $700,000 working for an industry he\u2019s in charge of regulating.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to care about this potential conflict of interest, because they\u2019ve confirmed Wheeler before; his ascent to EPA acting administrator was an automatic promotion from his Senate-confirmed role as deputy administrator. But Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse used Wednesday\u2019s hearing to argue that Wheeler had hidden information from the Senate about his relationship with the coal company."

    "text": "When an academic makes a research breakthrough, two things can happen in the public consciousness: nothing, or something. It\u2019s hard to know which is worse. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a physicist who discovers a particle that isn\u2019t affected by gravity. If nobody outside the physics world cares about your discovery, you sigh, shake your head, get back to the lab. If your story does hit the newspapers, on the other hand, you\u2019ll have to adjust to a different kind of outrage: Your scrupulous research will be repurposed into some bad headline (\u201cGRAVITY DISPROVEN\u201d) designed to yank eyeballs, extract clicks, and generally trample over your precious academic principles.\n\nLast week, the second thing happened. In a new article for Science Advances, Anita Radini, an archaeologist at Britain\u2019s University of York, published evidence showing the presence of lapis lazuli\u2014an ancient, rare, lovely blue stone pigment\u2014on the teeth of a medieval German nun. The nun\u2019s skeleton, named \u201cB78,\u201d dates from the 11th or early 12th century and was found in an unmarked grave in the German town of Dalheim. By working with tartar experts, microscopists, and medieval historians, Radini was able to conclude that this woman must have been a painter or scribe (or both) who illuminated manuscripts.\n\nImages of B78\u2019s teeth. Christina Warinner, Institute for Evolutionary Medicine, University of Z\u00fcrich.\n\nShe must also have been a very good one, since lapis lazuli was an extremely expensive pigment only mined in Afghanistan. It was reserved for the hands of high-end professionals. The pigment probably got into her mouth directly from the paintbrush, over the course of many years of work.\n\nThe story is delightful, all by itself. There\u2019s an element of chance to the findings\u2014nobody was looking for lapis lazuli on these teeth\u2014which lends them the charm of serendipity.

    "text": "In the end, even Kate Bush\u2019s counsel wasn\u2019t enough to cure my burnout. I resigned my position, sunk costs be damned. My wife and I live under the same roof now, and I\u2019m lucky to be married to someone with stable work and good benefits, since I took a 75 percent pay cut in becoming a freelance writer and adjunct instructor at a nearby university.\n\nQuitting worked for me, but this solution doesn\u2019t scale up very well. So what can we do about mass burnout? Petersen is right that individual solutions\u2014meditation, saying \u201cno\u201d to excessive work demands\u2014may be appealing, but won\u2019t solve the deeper problem.\n\nI mean all those things are great but they're not actually burnout cures, they're ways to optimize your mind and body for more and better work \u2014 Anne Helen Petersen (@annehelen) January 5, 2019\n\nBecause the causes are systemic, the solution to burnout will need to be too. Peterson noted why \u201cmany millennials increasingly identify with democratic socialism and are embracing unions: We are beginning to understand what ails us, and it\u2019s not something an oxygen facial or a treadmill desk can fix.\u201d But overthrowing capitalism isn\u2019t a complete solution, either. The things that cause burnout \u2013 from overwork and shoddy management to a lack of recognition \u2013 would likely persist in socialist systems. Workers burn out in social democracies like Sweden, too.\n\nWe can\u2019t just throw cash at the burnout problem, either, like Don Draper does on \u201cMad Men\u201d when his younger business partner Peggy Olson complains that her tireless work goes unrecognized. \u201cThat\u2019s what the money is for!\u201d he bellows. Of course, workers would benefit from higher wages, but a bigger paycheck won\u2019t keep you from burning out if you\u2019re treated unfairly, or your employer\u2019s values differ from yours, or your boss is a tyrant. Besides, burnout isn\u2019t just a reaction to bad jobs. I had a great job, but there were still problems with my workload and rewards I couldn\u2019t bear over the long term.\n\nAnd this is where the problem lies: There\u2019s no obvious solution. \u201cChange might come from legislation, or collective action, or continued feminist advocacy, but it\u2019s folly to imagine it will come from companies themselves,\u201d Peterson writes. \u201cOur capacity to burn out and keep working is our greatest value.\u201d But it\u2019s hard to see how Congress could legislate the problem away, especially given that Washington is also keenly interested, for economic reasons, in having as many Americans working as possible\u2014and doing so as efficiently as possible. As for collective action and feminist advocacy, they may help improve employment at the edges, but it\u2019s worth noting that even 9-to-5 workers with generous vacation time can burn out.\n\nIt may be impossible to eliminate burnout altogether. As long as we toil, there will be pain. But we can surely ease it. Burnout arises in our organizations, but it\u2019s a product of the unhealthy interpersonal relations we have there. That means it\u2019s not fundamentally an economic or political problem. It\u2019s an ethical one. It stems from the demands we place on others, the recognition we fail to give, the discord between our words and actions. The question can\u2019t just be how I can prevent my burnout; it has to be how I can prevent yours. The answer will entail not just creating better workplaces, but also becoming better people."

    "text": "THE SOPRANOS SESSIONS by Matt Zoller Seitz and Alan Sepinwall. Abrams Press, 480pp., $30.00\n\nAside from a brief introduction by Laura Lippman, The Sopranos Sessions is written entirely by three men: Matt Zoller Seitz, Alan Sepinwall, and show creator David Chase. Similarly, if you click on the \u201ccritic reviews\u201d section of The Sopranos\u2019s page on Rotten Tomatoes, every single \u201ctop critic\u201d listed is a man. The Sopranos Sessions is an excellent book, delving into all sorts of details and providing a rare opportunity to hear from Chase himself, who is shy of reporters. It even contains a \u201cEulogies\u201d section, on the life and death of James Gandolfini, who played Tony and died at 51 in 2013. It\u2019s an invaluable book to any fan, as was Martin\u2019s Difficult Men and The Sopranos: A Family History (2001) by Allen Rucker. But when you put all those books together along with the general cultural debris surrounding the show, you get a very selective impression of what The Sopranos meant to Americans while it was airing\u2014an impression dominated by antihero worship.\n\nOf course, The Sopranos\u2019s dissection of masculinity was innovative, even radical. But on the other hand, one might argue that The Sopranos simply did for television what Philip Roth did for fiction in the 1960s, and Martin Scorsese did for movies in the 1970s\u2014made it human. And we do not remember the novels of Roth or the movies of Scorsese solely for their interest in the antihero. Instead, young writers and filmmakers look up to these men as pioneers of technique. The male psyche was rich material for Roth and John Updike and their peers, but those writers broke new ground because of the language they used to mine it.\n\nThere is plenty of great academic writing about The Sopranos, and much brilliant, unsung criticism. But the legacy of Sopranos-crit is of a genre almost exclusively manufactured by men, for a male readership, about the nerdy nitty-gritty of a TV show about masculinity. This has contributed, I think, to a new culture of television-making dominated by psychological portraiture, usually focused on men. It has also led to hyper-lush production, at the expense of scriptwriting, simply because it\u2019s easier to throw money at a show than to write a good one.\n\nThis is the danger of allowing superfans to define the meaning of a television show. Though they may know The Sopranos better than anyone, they may end up taking away the wrong lessons. In the end, neither Paulie\u2019s weird hair nor Tony\u2019s panic attacks represent the core of what was good about The Sopranos. Instead, the show\u2019s pedigree lies in its handling of a few words, here and there\u2014an old man in an armchair denouncing \u201cdisharmony.\u201d The joy of watching a Sopranos patriarch comes not only from his easy authority, but also from the language he uses to express it.\n\nDespite the visual perfection of the shows being produced by Netflix and HBO today, the words have been lacking. That won\u2019t change until we change the way we talk about the golden age of television in the 2000s. Without the script, there\u2019s no Sopranos; without great writing, there\u2019s no \u201cprestige.\u201d In the words of a certain TV gangster, after all, \u201cWhat use is an unloaded gun?\u201d\n\n"

    "text": "He oozed a kind of authenticity missing from South African politics: rough, real, a product of spaces and cultures within the country that academics or the wealthy generally avoid.\n\nSuperior because South Africans got rid of their Trump. Eventually, a combination of factors worked against Zuma: relentless investigative work into his activities by the country\u2019s top journalists; a big electoral loss for the ruling ANC party in municipal elections in 2016; elite outcry at his excesses; and hard pushback by the country\u2019s judiciary institutions. In a late-night address last February, Zuma resigned as the country\u2019s president.\n\nSometimes I like to tell people back home that South Africa collapses 200 years of American history into just two decades: our past\u2014in substantial ways South Africa before 1994 resembled the antebellum South\u2014and our future, insofar as a white-run, purportedly white-designed, and visibly white-dominated public space is now dominated by people of color.\n\nMaybe South Africa has something to teach America: how to react to a leader like Zuma, one whose hard break from the political status quo yielded outrages\n\nand disregard for the truth that seemed to amplify with each passing day. And what can happen when a society gets rid of such a man. It\u2019s hard to look past the presidency of a person like Zuma or Donald Trump, hard to focus on anything but his survival or his downfall. But South Africa has been past it for almost a year now. \u201cTwenty-one years into our democracy, we are facing a crisis that could render our society dysfunctional,\u201d Stephen Grootes, one of the country\u2019s top political commentators, wrote of Zuma in 2015. Eventually Zuma was brought down. Had democracy been saved?\n\nMothakge Makwela, an early Zuma supporter, believed Mandela and the ANC didn\u2019t do enough for blacks at the end of apartheid. \u201cWe are suffering now because of the deal they agreed to.\u201d\n\nThe township of Diepsloot\u2014\u201cdeep ditch\u201d in Afrikaans\u2014is a relatively new settlement, a few square miles of poor, almost exclusively black people who have been coming to Johannesburg since the restrictions on movement that confined many blacks were lifted in the early \u201990s. Diepsloot is a bellwether for events in postapartheid South Africa. Before I moved to the country, I\u2019d read books on the magical redemption story that was its peaceful transition from white- to black-majority rule. I\u2019d seen the photographs of Mandela triumphantly clasping the hand of the country\u2019s last white president, an iconic end-of-20th-century symbol of humanity\u2019s potential to overcome the darker, prejudiced aspects of its nature.\n\nYet there was also the strong sense something was off. A feeling hung over the country that some national center couldn\u2019t hold. Inequality had increased since the end of apartheid, as some well-positioned people\u2014whites with capital and well-connected people of color\u2014were able to take advantage of the end of apartheid-era sanctions and market their wine or banks or clothing companies or sheer coolness throughout Africa and the world. White-headed households still brought in five times the income of black-headed ones. \u201cMadam,\u201d a black child politely asked me once while I was taking a stroll in a Johannesburg neighborhood, \u201cwhy aren\u2019t you in your car?\u201d He had never seen a white woman on foot before.\n\nDiepsloot was presented in the media as the epicenter of the problem. Hardly a week went by without a hair-raising story of violent protests against bad plumbing and attacks against migrants from elsewhere in Africa, on whom the residents took out their rage. Anton Harber, a leading journalist, warned that \u201cif you want to understand where this country is headed, listen to the people of Diepsloot.\u201d\n\nOn a recent afternoon I drove there to do just that. Mansions stood atop peaks lit gold in the waning sun, and sweet wooden signs swung along the main road: PARADISE BEND, COPPERLEAF GOLF ESTATE. The region around Diepsloot is colloquially considered \u201chorse country,\u201d a pastoral swath of homesteads and farms between Johannesburg and Pretoria, the country\u2019s capital. It looked on Google Maps as if I were right on top of Diepsloot, but I couldn\u2019t see or hear it.\n\nYet there was also the strong sense something was off. A feeling hung over the country that some national center couldn\u2019t hold. Inequality had increased since the end of apartheid.\n\nA quirk of South Africa\u2019s geography is that it makes starkly, physically real the kinds of cleavages that, in other countries, tend to be more figurative. Under apartheid, white-only neighborhoods were often intentionally separated from black, Indian, or mixed-race neighborhoods by a physical feature, like a river or a railway line. Townships were nestled into dips in the land, tucked behind the prettiest face of a mountain; some were even hidden in acoustically enclosed areas. From many a balcony or front stoop, South Africa still preserves the fantasy that life can be led as if black people don\u2019t exist. Much of the country remains enveloped in an eerie quiet: a silence so profound you can hear the lourie birds calling or the beating of your own heart, even though you know, very close, there are thousands of other hearts, beating, invisibly.\n\nI finally followed a pickup truck around a bend\u2014the area around Diepsloot is undergoing development, and the back of the truck was filled with black construction workers\u2014and there it was: a single shopping mall, with a rectangle of banks and a Kentucky Fried Chicken, and block upon block of shacks and street-side stalls selling shoes dumped by American charities and grilled chicken feet.\n\nI had come to Diepsloot to meet a 36-year-old resident named Mothakge Makwela. I\u2019d met Mothakge seven years earlier when I\u2019d followed the journalist Harber\u2019s advice and paid my first visit to Diepsloot. Mothakge operated a web site with articles dedicated to giving outsiders a view of township life.\n\nThis time, though, I wanted to talk to him about Zuma. Mothakge had been a huge Zuma supporter, organizing for his first election campaign in Diep\u00adsloot. \u201cHe was for the ordinary folk,\u201d Mothakge said.\n\nA slight man with short dreadlocks and soft eyes, he wore noticeably pressed clothes\u2014best to be disarmingly nice and reassuringly gentle-spoken to receive visitors. We went to the KFC at the Diepsloot Mall to talk about his past, and for him to explain to me how he could have supported a man like Jacob Zuma. As we ordered, the cashier entreated us to \u201cadd hope\u201d to our bill for two rand (about 15 cents)\u2014a campaign for a charity. Mothakge laughed and said that mirrored his experience coming of age in postapartheid South Africa. \u201cHope,\u201d he said, \u201cwas always something you buy.\u201d\n\nBorn in the country\u2019s rural east and raised, in part, in Diepsloot, Mothakge was 11 when Mandela was inau\u00adgu\u00adrated. The thrill around the transition to democracy had led him to expect something entirely different for himself than his parents had gotten out of life\u2014his mother was a maid, his father a driving instructor. And he\u2019d done his part, excelling in South Africa\u2019s famously difficult high school exit exam. He\u2019d hoped to become an engineer and to live in a place like Ferndale, the lush Johannesburg suburb where he\u2019d spent two years of high school on a scholarship.\n\nBut when he returned to Diepsloot after graduating, he began to feel he and his friends \u201cwere actually getting poorer.\u201d He could never make enough money to live in the central neighborhoods where whites still lived and operated businesses, while \u201cso-called investors\u201d who came to Diepsloot promising benefits\u2014like the mall with the KFC\u2014took out most of the cash, giving little back to the community. The new black leaders seemed to neglect the township, regarding it as an embarrassment and chastising the black people there \u201cfor the dirty way we lived\u201d and for attacking foreigners.\n\nThabo Mbeki\u2014a British-educated dandy who liked to quote Latin\u2014had frequently left the country to hang out at Davos and had instituted an affirmative-action program that ended up mainly benefiting the well-connected. Mothakge peeked into those beneficiaries\u2019 gilded lives when he and his friends would walk to the Fourways Mall in Johannesburg\u2014one of a host of fancy new developments that were springing up in formerly white neighborhoods. It boasted a specialty surfwear boutique, diamond jewelry stores, Steve Madden and Nike shops, and a gourmet frozen yogurt stand. Shop owners and staff would follow Mothakge around, he said, assuming that he was a thief. \u201cWhen you actually pay, you can see how relieved they are,\u201d Mothakge said bitterly. \u201cAnd this was done by our black brothers and sisters.\u201d\n\nMothakge was especially upset by the wide-open spaces he saw when he walked. So much land surrounded the cramped township: undeveloped fields being held by property companies as investments, fenced with razor wire, overhung by tall, black spotlights, and posted with signs warning that \u201ctrespassers\u201d\u2014people like himself, he gathered\u2014would be arrested.\n\nHe could not understand why, after apartheid, he would be called a \u201ctrespasser\u201d in the eyes of a police force run by a black president. \u201cThis is my land now,\u201d he said. But whites still owned the majority\u2014two-thirds, by some estimates\u2014of South Africa\u2019s land.\n\nMothakge even began to doubt Mandela. After Mandela was released from prison, he\u2019d befriended white mining and insurance magnates; in the late 2000s, before Zuma became president, an interpretation circled around Diepsloot that the deal Mandela and the ANC had negotiated for black people had been a Nobel Peace Prize-friendly abrogation of justice that had left apartheid\u2019s brutally unequal economic system\u2014and the racism and classism that enabled it\u2014intact. Economic experts and the black leadership always insisted nothing really radical could be done about apartheid\u2019s legacy; if a redistribution was attempted, the country would undergo a postcolonial collapse, like Zimbabwe next door. \u201cWe are suffering now because of the deal they agreed to,\u201d Mothakge told me plainly.\n\nLike many South Africans in his position, he\u2019d put his hopes in Zuma. One of the interesting things about Zuma is that a wider range of people initially supported him in South Africa than backed Trump in America. A white friend of mine, a young entrepreneur, posted \u201c100% ZULU BOY\u201d\u2014one of Zuma\u2019s slogans\u2014on his Facebook wall. Another friend\u2014a bowtied white executive\u2014rhapsodized to me about Zuma\u2019s multiple wives. He mentioned a newspaper photo he\u2019d seen of three of them asleep together on a bench, beatific looks on their faces, and expressed awe that \u201cone man\u201d could keep that many women \u201cso happy.\u201d\n\nIf some of Trump\u2019s support in America reflected a reaction to genuine problems\u2014governmental gridlock, economic anxiety, the sense that elite wisdom no longer spoke to many Americans\u2014in South Africa, the problems that gave rise to Zuma were considered even more critical to resolve. Crime, fed by inequality, had ballooned to the point that some analysts designated the country perhaps the most violent in the world. My friend who posted \u201c100% ZULU BOY\u201d said he felt relieved that the face of leadership might be shifting away from people who looked, or at least acted, so much like him; the tone and priorities of political leaders had just seemed wrong, since most South African voters were not well-connected and polished like Mbeki. And it had seemed dangerous. \u201cThere is a rage building at the base of society,\u201d a university professor warned during a lecture I attended. \u201cThat rage has the risk of burning everything we have built in this country over the last 15 years.\u201d\n\nMandela and Mbeki had often used words like \u201cprudent\u201d and \u201cmodern\u201d to justify their leadership style. As the heads of the last African country to overthrow white rule, they harbored an intense fear of becoming another sad postcolonial tale. They didn\u2019t want to do anything Marxist or pan-Africanist or against the received wisdom of international experts, financiers, or the people who already held capital. The African postcolonial narrative most foreign observers\u2014and investors\u2014knew was that even well-intentioned leaders who broke with Western advice, like Ghana\u2019s Kwame Nkrumah and Mozambique\u2019s Samora Machel, ruined their countries. By the late 20th century, South Africa was by far the richest African country. It carried on its shoulders the pride and stability of a continent. It had a reputation to sustain.\n\nBut their fastidious efforts to act like \u201cacceptable,\u201d upstanding Western leaders led them, even if unwittingly, to perpetuate political habits ingrained during white rule\u2014favoring the interests of the already-wealthy, spouting high-flown language about principles that resulted in too little for the country\u2019s poorest. \u201cI feel like a lot of the leaders we have\u2014you liken them to white men in society,\u201d Tshidi Madia, a black journalist, told me. \u201cWhere they become so removed from the people they serve. There is absolutely no shame in jumping out of a Range Rover into somebody\u2019s shack and saying, \u2018Hi, I stand with you!\u2019\u201d Elite skepticism of Zuma reminded Mothakge, painfully, of the suspicious way he was viewed at Fourways Mall.\n\nZuma might have been \u201ccorrupt,\u201d but he spoke to a deeper truth underlying South African life, which was that it was entirely rational to question what publicly presented itself as respectability and virtue. S\u2019thembile Cele, another journalist, told me something that sounded paradoxical, but that makes sense\u2014and which parallels the feeling many of Trump\u2019s supporters have about him. \u201cZuma was untainted by false goodness.\u201d\n\nFighting Zuma\u2019s corruption made people like journalist Tshidi Madia more cynical, a shift in attitude that lasted past his ouster.\n\nIt was almost eerie how short Zuma\u2019s honeymoon period was. Once he got into power, there was a near-instant recoil from some of the behaviors people had looked forward to, or at least condoned, when Zuma was just an alternative to the status quo. With government money, Zuma began expanding a large homestead in his home province. This befit a Zulu chief, but taxpayers complained. He attacked a white cartoonist for lampooning him; prior to his election, it might have been enjoyable to see him thumbing his nose at a white journalist\u2019s notions of propriety, but once he held office it provoked outrage. Instead of appointing fresh figures as his Cabinet ministers, he tapped cronies late at night and, like Trump, swapped them out constantly.\n\nIt soon became clear Zuma\u2019s crookedness was not revolutionary nor symbolic. The ground didn\u2019t quake with change, or even plain old vengeance against the unjust system; instead, he seems to have just stolen a lot of money, pilfering from various state agencies, and then retreated out of sight and sired more children with several other women. Many bad things happened and almost no discernibly good things. Inequality climbed while the rand devalued by more than half against the dollar; his associates got rich while prosperity slipped further out of sight for the likes of Mothakge Makwela. \u201cThe African son of a working-class family let down the country,\u201d is how Mothakge put it that afternoon at KFC.\n\nThese accumulating outrages united the country for the first time, perhaps, since Mandela\u2019s election. South Africans came to share a refreshing sense of enmity to Zuma. It seemed as if every political commentator put out a book ascribing South Africa\u2019s dysfunctions\u2014from its power outages to its corruption\u2014to Zuma. Every problem became associated with him: \u201cIf the rand fell, it was Zuma,\u201d Mothakge said. \u201cIf it rained, it was Zuma.\u201d Civil-society groups filed reams of cases against him.\n\nSouth Africa has an entity like America\u2019s special pros\u00adecutor, but standing, not appointed on a case-by-case basis. The Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela, prepared a dossier over years on Zuma\u2019s malfeasance, and it became the hope on which the country hung. As we now have Robert Mueller versus Trump, they had the public protector versus Zuma. One news outlet dubbed Madonsela the \u201cguardian\u201d of \u201cwhat is good and great about South Africa.\u201d\n\nIn a hipster caf\u00e9 in downtown Johannesburg where I ate a couple of days after I met with Mothakge, I saw a copy of The Economist from October 2016 prominently displayed on a table near the front window. \u201cHealthy democracies depend on unwritten rules,\u201d the lead editorial\u2014on Trump\u2014stated.\n\nI suspected the magazine was there because its opinion seemed to speak to the mood in South Africa, too. The discomforts with the status quo that had swept Zuma into office had been temporarily forgotten, replaced by a hearty defense of institutions and political norms. People now felt that their traditions and norms were precious, and Zuma had violated them. It was strange, though, because this sentiment was nearly the opposite of the one that had dominated the country a decade earlier. A reminder of the former mindset lay tucked beneath The Economist in an obscure foundation\u2019s 2016 report on economic inequality\u2014an injustice propped up, in South Africa, by the kind of unwritten societal rules the populace was going to the barricades to defend. \u201cAn exhausted woman working 60 hours a week in a clothing factory,\u201d it read. \u201cA woman cleaning luxury gated flats at dawn, getting mugged as she walks to work from her home on the edge of the city.\u201d\n\nIt was faded, and stained so long ago that its glossy pages had stuck together. As I labored to unglue them with a fingernail, a waiter cheerfully offered, \u201cYou can just give that to me to throw away.\u201d\n\nMy friend Palesa Morudu, a 48-year-old black South African newspaper columnist who travels often to the United States, told me the mood in America right now reminded her eerily of South Africa in the latter stages of Zuma\u2019s presidency\u2014the feeling of \u201cbeing at five to midnight\u201d; \u201cthat East Coast hysteria, screaming at Trump all the time.\u201d\n\nBut she had a warning for my fellow Americans: Even as Zuma\u2019s adversaries imagined they were \u201cwinning,\u201d there crept in a deep-seated exhaustion, an apathy. \u201cWhat it did was make us so numb.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa accomplished what liberal Americans still only dream of\u2014ousting their enemy. After Zuma resigned in early 2018, the ruling ANC replaced him with Cyril Ramaphosa, a much more \u201cnormal\u201d-seeming politician and businessman highly admired by economic analysts and overseas observers. The former head of a mineworkers\u2019 union who led strikes against apartheid in the 1980s, Ramaphosa, alongside Mandela, had negotiated the political and economic deal that eased South Africa out of white rule in the early \u201990s, and many older South Africans felt a lingering affection for him. Initially, there was an outpouring of relief and excitement. People called it \u201cRamaphoria.\u201d\n\nRamaphosa wears well-tailored suits and avoids any hint of demagoguery, speaking in polished, pleasing sound-bites and steering clear of rowdy Zuma-style mass rallies and the press. He nonetheless took office with a history arguably as damning as any post\u00adapartheid leader. Extraordinarily wealthy, he serves on numerous boards. In 2012, he emailed the board of a platinum mine on which he serves to encourage them to deploy the police against a group of desperately poor miners striking for higher wages, calling them \u201ccriminal.\u201d The next day, the police shot 34 miners dead in South Africa\u2019s worst massacre since apartheid\u2019s end.\n\nNothing could have been more symbolic of exactly what had disturbed South Africans back in the 2000s about the trajectory of their politics: that leaders who\u2019d once represented the people had become their adversaries; that power brokers were using fully legitimate channels and nice-sounding language to achieve unjust ends; that evildoers draped themselves carefully in the globally recognized apparel and rhetoric of virtue.\n\nA friend told me the mood in America right now reminded her eerily of South Africa in the latter stages of Zuma\u2019s presidency\u2014the feeling of \u201cbeing at five to midnight\u201d; \u201cthat East Coast hysteria, screaming at Trump all the time.\u201d\n\nIn a way, the feelings that pervaded South Africa when I arrived ten years ago resemble America\u2019s sense of itself before Trump. It\u2019s easy to hate Trump\u2019s behavior now. But we can\u2019t deny that, for decades before his rise, a wide range of Americans wanted something loosely like it. Liberals would have been thrilled to have a president a little like Trump\u2014uncompromising, willing to call political adversaries out as hypocrites\u2014if she or he had pursued liberal policies.\n\nAs in South Africa, myths we\u2019ve long been telling ourselves about our country have been coming apart\u2014that we\u2019re united, that we\u2019re fair, that the people who attain power and respectability in our society are, thanks to our values, likely to be good people.\n\nMuch like South Africa after its liberation, the United States surged into the 1990s in a triumphal mood. Francis Fukuyama wrote, \u201cWhat we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War ... but the end of history as such,\u201d a time when \u201call prior contradictions are resolved and all human needs are satisfied.\u201d Bill Clinton assured us that free trade would benefit all Americans. Economists and web designers talked of the coming of a technocratic utopia. \u201cEquality between the sexes,\u201d proclaimed one op-ed in The New York Times, had been \u201caccomplished,\u201d and in high school, my friends and I learned that racism was obsolete. America was so confident, outwardly, it invaded Iraq presuming it could redesign it from scratch with a 24-year-old Yale grad at the head of its stock exchange.\n\nBut all was not actually well. The contradictions of modern American democracy we\u2019d tried to convince ourselves had been vanquished\u2014racism, sexism, Gilded Age-style consumerist excess, the merging of the political class with the economic elite, hubris abroad\u2014remained entrenched. The same year Clinton won the presidency, Los Angeles exploded in violence after the police beat Rodney King. After an affair, Clinton was impeached with great moral righteousness by men who were secretly conducting their own affairs, and he was succeeded as president by a so-called conservative who sank $2 trillion of his taxpayers\u2019 money into a failed Middle East redecorating project. An opioid epidemic began to take root in areas devastated by the venture-capitalization of American business, the disappearance of manufacturing, and still-simmering racial tensions.\n\nBy the late 2000s and the Great Recession, it was clear that many of the things we were told by the people we were expected to trust might not be true. Trust in government fell dramatically\u2014and not just trust in government, but trust in doctors and journalists and academics and every kind of arbiter of political and societal norms. And it was deserved. Financiers escaped consequences for the recession. The media helped lead America into the Iraq War. Political discourse itself seemed, more than ever, to be built on a foundation of utter bullshit. Self-described \u201cconservatives\u201d blew up the deficit while a \u201cliberal\u201d president bailed out robber barons. We wanted change. Radical change. Remember that?\n\n\n\nAfter ousting their new president, South Africans turned back to the kind of leader they had felt so bitter about a decade ago. But unlike Zuma, Ramaphosa didn\u2019t make a show of his corruption. His closest political ally is the now-deputy president, a former provincial governor so sleazy he\u2019s been credibly accused of stealing money meant for poor schools and faces questions about his role in political assassinations. But Ramaphosa takes care not to appear in public with his consigliere too often. At least, the journalist Tshidi Madia told me, Ramaphosa \u201ckeeps it\u201d\u2014his corruption\u2014\u201cquiet.\u201d\n\nAs in South Africa, long-held myths about our country have been coming apart\u2014that we\u2019re united, that we\u2019re fair, that the people who attain power and respectability in our society are, thanks to our values, likely to be good people.\n\nIt was as if the South Africans who fought against Zuma had subtly shifted their goalpost from a wish for truly new leadership to a lesser, more cynical ambition: to have leaders that simply had the decency to conceal their wrong\u00addoing. \u201cI wanted Ramaphosa to win,\u201d my friend Palesa told me. \u201cI just wanted to breathe a little bit. Do you know what I mean? Is our president self-interested, or a traitor? Neither is good, but I started to feel one was a little better.\u201d Madia told me that because South Africans\u2019 aspirations\u2014for more economic justice, for less racism, for less worship of a far-off Western standard of leadership and life\u2014had become associated with such a tainted vehicle, Zuma, these deeper yearnings for change became \u201ca bit discredited.\u201d If a more \u201cauthentic\u201d president had been such a nightmare, maybe more authenticity itself was not worth aiming for.\n\nZuma had been a nearly unmitigated disaster. But the things some people had hoped he would do\u2014such as rejecting the old elites\u2019 kowtowing to the Davos crowd, fighting the political class\u2019s deepening hypocrisy, telling hard but refreshing truths, enacting more economically redistributive policies\u2014hadn\u2019t been silly or wrong. They were necessary. They remain necessary. But the interesting thing\u2014and remember my friend Palesa\u2019s numbness\u2014is people are no longer as convinced that they are. In the course of the fight against Zuma, South Africans\u2019 commitment to certain important democratic institutions that he attacked, like the judiciary, deepened. But other, crucial commitments\u2014such as the conviction that a healthy democracy should provide fair opportunities for all, and that politicians should be expected to do some actual good\u2014were weakened. South Africans thought they had won, but in some sense, they had also been defeated.\n\nAfter Zuma, Tshidi Madia, once an ardent idealist, radically shifted her expectations for her country. She seemed to have accepted that its politics\u2014that its society\u2014was profoundly corrupted. She showed me some pictures she had on her phone of Ramaphosa\u2019s ally, the one who allegedly arranged hits on his political opponents. She had met him a few times and thought he was cute.\n\n\u201cI adore him,\u201d she confessed. \u201cThey call him \u2018The Cat,\u2019 since he\u2019s sly. We get along really well!\u201d She laughed shyly. \u201cHe has the most beautiful smile. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying that.\u201d\n\nShe recognized that there was something sad about rewarding just-barely-less-bad-than-Jacob Zuma as virtue. But South Africans were so burnt out by the existential fight they pitched against Zuma, and so desperate to see the leader who came after him as good, that they blinded themselves to Ramaphosa\u2019s iniquity. Ramaphosa\u2019s behavior with the platinum mine was disturbing, she said, but \u201cnobody wants to hear about it. South Africans want to have a head of state they think they can believe in.\u201d"

    "text": "The Never Trump movement of disaffected conservatives emerged almost as soon as Trump became the presumptive nominee in 2016. George Will, the eminent conservative columnist, left the Republican Party that June, weeks before the Republican National Convention. The convention itself was raucous, with numerous challenges to Trump\u2019s nomination. Later in the summer, former CIA officer Evan McMullin announced an independent presidential campaign, and was endorsed by a host of Never Trumpers, including Weekly Standard founder Bill Kristol, National Review columnist Jonah Goldberg, and Hillbilly Elegy author J.D. Vance. He received 700,000 votes, finishing behind the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein and Libertarian Gary Johnson.\n\n\n\nMcMullin\u2019s campaign played well in conservative media circles, in part because his campaign was geared toward voters who were fearful of Trump\u2019s inexperience and ideological heresies, yet unwilling to vote for Hillary Clinton. But those susceptible to this appeal, then as now, are few. Despite abysmal polling numbers with voters broadly, Trump is, historically speaking, more popular with Republicans than any other president, including Ronald Reagan. (Only post-9/11 George W. Bush can compete with him.) Even in the midst of an unpopular government shutdown that he gleefully took credit for, his numbers remain strong among Republicans. Only 15 percent blame him for the shutdown, while 69 percent blame congressional Democrats.\n\n\n\nHayes\u2019s argument, like many that preceded it, makes a moral and political case for challenging Trump: Republicans must stand up in opposition to the \u201csteady stream of lies\u201d emanating from Trump\u2019s Twitter feed, his authoritarian desire to declare a national emergency to build a border wall, and his chaotic approach to foreign policy. Hayes concludes that a primary challenge is unlikely to \u201cdo more damage to Trump\u2019s reelection effort than Trump has done himself,\u201d and insists that such a challenge would not be hopeless. \u201cAnd as Trump supporters should understand better than most, the volatility of the current political moment means that things \u2018everyone knows\u2019 cannot happen sometimes do,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFor the good of the country, sometimes it\u2019s vital that they do.\u201d\n\n\n\nNever Trump arguments like these have been amplified for a number of reasons, but not because they\u2019re widely popular. Trump\u2019s detractors are overrepresented in Washington media and regularly appear on mainstream media programs, particularly shows like Meet the Press, which attempt to present ideological balance. The thought of a primary challenge has a rich political history, most recently in Reagan\u2019s challenge to Gerald Ford in 1976 and Ted Kennedy\u2019s campaign against Jimmy Carter in 1980. Finally, intraparty conflict is the kind of story that whets the appetite of any horse-race journalist.\n\n\n\nBut if moral case for challenging Trump is clear, the political case is anything but. His approval rating with his party has only climbed in recent months amid the very news that Hayes deems damaging: In late December, 89 percent of Republicans approved of his job performance. It\u2019s difficult to imagine what else Trump could do that would suddenly change these supporters\u2019 minds\u2014especially not if the choice is between him and a \u201creasonable\u201d alternative who is selling a watered-down alternative to Trump\u2019s immigration policies, a comparable fiscal policy (minus the trade war, which Republican voters have embraced), and a hawkish foreign policy that is increasingly on the outs in both parties.\n\n"

    "text": "Republicans never truly reckoned with the midterms. Their defeat of several high-profile Democrats\u2014Beto O\u2019Rourke, Andrew Gillum, and Stacey Abrams\u2014and two-seat gain in the Senate allowed them to put a positive spin on the results. (Never mind that many of those candidates were long-shots, and that the Senate map was a nightmare for Democrats.) Also, more than a dozen House races weren\u2019t certified until weeks after the election, obscuring the extent of the GOP\u2019s losses. Much of the initial media coverage thus didn\u2019t declare what would later become apparent: This was every bit the \u201cblue wave\u201d that had been predicted.\n\n\n\nWhen Republican leaders finally were asked about the midterms, they made excuses. Paul Ryan, then retiring as House speaker, echoed Trump\u2019s conspiratorial language, blaming court-ordered redistricting in Pennsylvania and California\u2019s voting procedures. \u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s suburban voters. Pennsylvania redistricting and California just defies logic to me,\u201d Ryan told The Washington Post in November. \u201cThis election system they have [in California], I can\u2019t begin to understand it.\u201d Kevin McCarthy, now the House minority leader, told his caucus that \u201chistory was against\u201d the party, as if the defeat was fated\u2014and said he would continue to back the president.\n\n\n\nBut mostly, Republicans have put their heads in the sand, refusing to consider the implications of the midterm results or the role the president and his immigration policy played. \u201cThere has been close to no introspection in the G.O.P. conference and really no coming to grips with the shifting demographics that get to why we lost those seats,\u201d New York Republican Elise Stefanik told The New York Times. \u201cI\u2019m very frustrated and I know other members are frustrated.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat lack of introspection has once again pushed Republicans to back the president as he advances an unpopular immigration policy supported by only a third of Americans. To an extent, they are standing behind him out of fear. Given Trump\u2019s hounding of opponents within his own party\u2014senators Jeff Flake and Bob Corker both retired rather than run for reelection\u2014there is some concern that stepping out of line will attract the ire of the president and his allies in conservative media, ultimately resulting in their defeat to a pro-Trump challenger in their next primary election.\n\n\n\nBut it also points to a Republican leadership that is completely neutered. Two years ago, they made what could be seen as a calculated bet. They decided to defend the president, both from the Russia investigation and from his many self-inflicted wounds, in exchange for a shot at repealing Obamacare and passing a $1.5 trillion corporate tax cut. With Democrats now in control of the House\u2014and, again, with ample evidence that the president\u2019s immigration policies are not popular with a majority of voters\u2014they have little incentive to continue to stand behind the president as he prolongs his self-destructive government shutdown, especially now that 800,000 federal workers are missing a paycheck.\n\n"

    "authors": [
      "Alexis Papazoglou"
    ],
    "text": "This argument wasn\u2019t entirely new in the 1980s: The German Romantic movement made similar objections to Immanuel Kant\u2019s philosophy in the Enlightenment, which prefigured Rawls\u2019s liberalism by arguing that each individual\u2019s moral worth derived from their partaking in the universal capacity to reason, rather than something bestowed on them due to their membership of a particular nation or ethnic group. The German Romantics\u2019 dismissal of universalism and reason-based moral worth, (reason being a cold and abstract way to evaluate a human, they thought) returning to the particulars of identity, found political expression in many of the nationalist projects of the 20th century\u2014some of them exceedingly brutal.\n\nA tension between liberal and communitarian instincts has arguably always been present in American politics.\n\nCommunitarianism, as the 1980s iteration of this general theory came to be called, made a point very similar to the one that identity politics advocates on the left make today, who argue that social, racial and gender identity matter to questions of justice. This right-wing version of identity politics, emphasizing things like religious and national or ethnic identity as key to determining who deserves what in politics, offered a different, less universal conception of political responsibility and justice, based on the idea that our political and moral ties are first and foremost towards our community, rather than to those outside it. Few people, communitarians argue, would truly consider their moral duty to a stranger analogous to their moral duty to, say, their mother or their child.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s self-identification as a nationalist and his attitude towards immigration place him squarely on the communitarian side of this philosophical divide, even if the original philosophers might not see eye-to-eye with his way of embodying it. His slogan of \u201cAmerica first\u201d and his dismissal of \u201cglobalists\u201d who he says want \u201cthe globe to do very well, frankly not caring about our country so much,\u201d have been connected by scholars to a sinister political history of the extreme right. But what makes it possible to arrive at such extreme politics in the first place is the implicit claim that some people have more political value by virtue of being Americans, rather than citizens of the world, human beings with universal rights.\n\nA tension between liberal and communitarian instincts has arguably always been present in American politics. One of the country\u2019s foundational texts, the Declaration of Independence, claims that \u201call men are created equal\u201d and that they have certain \u201cunalienable rights\u201d including \u201clife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d But despite the universal, liberal character of the declaration, it had a narrow communitarian meaning when it was written: Women, Native Americans, African Americans, and members of other nations were excluded from the group that enjoyed claims to equality and rights. As time went on, the community expanded, and eventually came to include those who weren\u2019t initially recognized as members.\n\nSince then, liberalism\u2019s principles of universalism have been enshrined in several international documents the United States has participated in. Liberalism\u2019s identification of the individual as the center of political value has found the most concrete political expression in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights\u2014a recognition by all the countries who signed it that people\u2019s political liberties and value stem not from their membership of a particular community, but simply in virtue of their human identity. Among the rights recognized is the right to seek and enjoy asylum from persecution."

    "text": "Trump\u2019s hotel is well-situated in the capital, so it\u2019s not surprising that inaugural events would be held there. (For similar reasons, it\u2019s also not surprising that top executives would opt to stay there.) But the optics are troubling at best. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee raked in more than $100 million from corporate and individual donors, a far higher sum than similar committees operated by George W. Bush and Barack Obama. By spending those funds at Trump\u2019s properties, the inaugural committee effectively transfers those donors\u2019 contributions directly into the Trump Organization\u2019s coffers. And since Trump hasn\u2019t fully divested himself of his business holdings, as ethics officials recommended before his inauguration, those profits eventually flow into the pockets of the president and his adult children.\n\nWhat have donors received in return? Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, a Republican mega-donor and the committee\u2019s largest individual contributor, gave more than $5 million. He happens to enjoy a close relationship with the president. Adelson and his wife joined Trump at a small private gathering last November to watch the results of the 2018 midterms. The Trump era has also been a fruitful one for Adelson. The Las Vegas billionaire lobbied in favor of the president\u2019s decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem in 2017, reversing decades of U.S. foreign policy on the matter. And earlier this week, the Justice Department reversed an Obama-era legal opinion in declaring that federal law bans all forms of internet gambling, which Adelson strenuously opposes as a potential threat to his casino empire.\n\nAdelson, like any other American, has the right to donate to political campaigns and committees and lobby elected officials. Foreign governments enjoy no such privileges, however. That distinction makes the overseas cash flows into the Trump Organization all the more alarming. Last month, the Post reported that a lobbyist for Saudi Arabia\u2019s monarchy spent more than $270,000 for rooms at Trump\u2019s hotel shortly after his election as president. Those rooms housed dozens of U.S. veterans who were then brought to Capitol Hill to lobby against a law that would open the door to lawsuits against the Saudi government for the September 11th attacks.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only time that foreign powers have done business on Trump properties, either. The Times identified stays at the president\u2019s hotels by the Malaysian prime minister and his staff, as well as by the Republic of Georgia\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations. Romania\u2019s consulate in Chicago also rented space at Trump\u2019s hotel in that city for an event last November. Both the foreign governments and the Trump administration have denied any wrongdoing or impropriety; the Trump Organization has also paid six-figure sums to the Treasury to offset any foreign expenditures to it. The company hasn\u2019t been forthcoming about tabulating the precise sources of these profits, however. And it\u2019s unclear whether this is enough to avoid violating the Constitution\u2019s ban on foreign incomes to federal public officials.\n\nTrump no longer maintains day-to-day control over his business empire. Some of his actions may have nonetheless favored his plum real-estate property in the capital. Last year, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee accused the president of improperly intervening in the search for a new FBI headquarters. The bureau\u2019s current headquarters, the J. Edgar Hoover Building, is a crumbling Brutalist scar on Pennsylvania Avenue. One plan would have transferred its staff and operations to a new headquarters in the suburbs and sold the coveted property to a private developer. Democrats alleged that Trump intervened to keep the bureau at its current location, thereby preventing another hotel from being built just a few steps from his own."

      "Matt Ford"
    ],
    "text": "Thanks to the results of last year\u2019s midterm elections, there are almost certainly enough votes in the House to impeach Trump\u2014and almost certainly not enough votes in the Republican-controlled Senate to convict him. Even if the entire Democratic caucus voted to convict Trump, twenty Republican senators would need to join them to oust him from office. That\u2019s an extraordinarily high barrier for Trump\u2019s opponents to overcome in a hyper-partisan climate. Support for impeachment may also wane overall as 2020 draws closer; lawmakers and the public may be uncomfortable with removing a president from office so close to an election, which could accomplish the same result but with greater political legitimacy.\n\nIn some ways, this is a familiar debate. Impeachment threats became a staple of American presidencies after the House impeached Bill Clinton in 1998. (He was subsequently acquitted by the Senate the following year.) Some Democrats in Congress, mostly on the party\u2019s left wing, filed articles of impeachment against George W. Bush related to the Iraq War, administration scandals, and other topics. A smaller number of Republicans proposed impeaching Barack Obama during his presidency. None of these efforts attracted mainstream support, however, and party leaders ultimately squelched them in the House before they went far.\n\nThis time is different. Trump is openly hostile to any constraints on his power. He castigates federal judges who rule against him so frequently and so vehemently that Chief Justice John Roberts publicly came to their defense last year. While Congress refuses to fund his border wall, he has threatened to declare a national emergency to secure the funds without congressional approval. Trump is also averse to basic democratic principles. When polls showed him trailing ahead of the 2016 presidential election, he spread false allegations that the election was rigged against him. During last year\u2019s midterms, he deployed the military within U.S. borders as a partisan campaign stunt.\n\nElections are typically the best means for removing presidents for bad policies or general incompetence. Impeachment is supposed to be reserved for serious abuses of power, or when the office-holder threatens the integrity of American democracy. There\u2019s a strong case to be made for impeaching Trump on those grounds. The New York Times\u2019 David Leonhardt laid out four specific reasons last week: for using the presidency to enrich himself and his businesses, for violating campaign-finance laws during the 2016 election, by obstructing justice during the Russia investigation, and by subverting the nation\u2019s democratic structures throughout his presidency.\n\nA serious challenge for any impeachment effort is the lack of precedent for it. There have been two presidential impeachment trials over the last 230 years, and neither ended in his removal from office. (Richard Nixon resigned before the House could impeach him after learning his conviction would be virtually certain in the Senate.) So while there are plenty of ways to show how impeachment can fail, there is none showing it can succeed. The Constitution itself offers little guidance: Presidents can be impeached for \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d which can mean whatever the House and Senate want it to mean."

    "text": "If Kondo wants you to throw out everything that doesn\u2019t feel personal, then Instant Hotel and Stay Here emphasize getting rid of personal effects in order to make the domestic space as generic as possible, the better to profitably enter it into the sharing economy, in which strangers will have to feel like it is their home as well.\n\nStay Here, another Netflix original production, is the highest-budget and most fun of the group in a hate-watch, eat-the-rich kind of way\u2014it could be used for DSA radicalization sessions. Its tagline is \u201cMakeover. Make money.\u201d HGTV star Genevieve Gorder, a charming designer, and Peter Lorimer, a slick British music producer turned celebrity realtor, take properties that are being rented on Airbnb or the more luxe platform VRBO and renovate them so that they are better short-term rentals: the best Airbnb they can be.\n\nAn interior from Netflix\u2019s \u201cStay Here.\u201d Cristopher Nolasco\n\nTheir chief goals are to raise the nightly rental price and occupancy rates. They crunch the numbers on-screen, reassuring the property owners that they will recoup all their mortgage and maintenance expenses plus a tidy profit. They achieve this by bringing in faux-mid century furniture, building out the same open kitchen you see in every new condo development, and adding a \u201csocial media moment,\u201d some Instagrammable object or mural wall that will prompt guests to do your marketing for you. In Austin, it\u2019s a geometric pattern painted on the poolhouse; in Palm Springs, it\u2019s a period-piece 1970s room covered in pink upholstery. Gorder is ecstatic.\n\nLet us consider the case of one gentleman who bought a disused firehouse in Washington, D.C., and turned it into his own apartment as well as an Airbnb. He lived in the huge loft space behind two floor-to-ceiling arched windows and rented out the darkened caverns in the rest of the building, which were filled with furniture barely worthy of a frat house. Gorder and Lorimer obviously kicked him out of the nice part of the house\u2014you have to prioritize the guests\u2014and opened the bright loft to the rest of the space.\n\nIt turns out that the firehouse was the first African-American firehouse in the city, opened because black firemen were having trouble getting promoted by racist white officers. Instead of, say, turning some part of it into a public space, Gorder fetishizes its heritage with bunk beds made of fire-poles and a vintage photo mural of the garage in its active days. \u201cNow you can sleep in a piece of history!\u201d Thus authenticity is commodified as #DCfirehouse4, $850 a night. Also not mentioned is the threat of gentrification that families of wealthy tourists pose to the historically African-American neighborhood.\n\nIn Stay Here, we might observe certain rules for an optimized Airbnb. You need to have as many bedrooms as possible, because \u201cheads in beds\u201d make money. Don\u2019t think of it as a home; \u201cyou have to think like the GM of a small hotel,\u201d bringing a strong business plan. Key to the process is what Gorder persists in calling \u201cdepersonalization\u201d: removing any artifacts like family photos or mementos so that guests won\u2019t feel like they\u2019re in someone else\u2019s life. Depersonalization also happens to be the clinical term for a psychological disorder in which you feel detached from yourself, like a robot. It seems apt. The Stay Here thesis is not that by remaking your house you might be happier; it is that you will be wealthier. \u201cI\u2019m going to crush my competition,\u201d a man in Austin enthuses in a fit of post-renovation real estate Darwinism.\n\nNetflix / Cristopher Nolasco\n\nHomes were not competition until sharing-economy platforms gamified them with revenue charts and star ratings. Instant Hotel gamifies the gamification. The show originally aired in Australia in 2017 before Netflix picked it up. Two sessions of five Australian couples who have turned their houses into rental properties (\u201cinstant hotels\u201d) go on a kind of national road trip, staying together at every other couple\u2019s rental and then evaluating it, often viciously, like a mobile Big Brother. The categories are Design, Location & Attractions, Night\u2019s Sleep, and Value; grand prize is a trip to California to stay in a famous Airbnb that might belong to a celebrity.\n\nPersonality is the problem. One couple is derided for their collection of 1950s American kitsch, another for their profusion of fake flowers, still another for the shower in the master bathroom with a full-length window you can\u2019t block. When your home is a commodity, nothing unique or quirky is allowed. The winner of the entire competition is a \u201cZen\u201d retreat that looks as inoffensive as humanly possible. Yet the show\u2019s only appealing element is personality. It\u2019s fun to watch for Australianisms. The group goes to a rural pub, races cane toads, and spears mud crabs. It did not make me want to travel there.\n\nMaybe the issue is that these shows are too relevant, hovering on the border of entertainment and twenty-first-century economic survivalism. Years after its peak, Kondo-ing once again took over the Internet in the past week as viewers posted photos of their socks neatly aligned in drawers. I wondered if anything I owned truly sparked joy. Then again, if I suddenly couldn\u2019t afford my rent, I could just ditch everything with a whiff of personality, then install bunk beds, pendant lights, and an Instagram wall with a hashtag decal and let my apartment monetize itself, right?\n\nWhat these reality shows really point to is the need for rent control and tenants\u2019 rights, a world in which we don\u2019t have to repackage our homes in order to keep them. I propose outlawing private property and giving everyone 365 Airbnb credits a year instead.\n\nPerec\u2019s Jerome and Sylvie never find their way out of materialism either, despite abandoning Paris briefly for Tunisia. They return to France and find executive advertising jobs with salaries better suited to their tastes. \u201cThey will have their chesterfield settee,\u201d Perec writes. \u201cThey will have huge and empty rooms full of light; plenty of clearance, glass panels, magnificent outlook.\u201d Sounds nice, I\u2019d stay there."

    "text": "A few weeks after President Donald Trump moved into the White House, he received a memo from one of his biggest campaign donors: Robert Murray, the CEO of Murray Energy, America\u2019s largest private coal company. Emblazoned with the words \u201cAction Plan,\u201d it was essentially a wish list of all the environmental regulations Murray wanted Trump to get rid of.\n\n\n\nNearly two years later, Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency is on track to fulfill almost all of Murray\u2019s requests. And the Senate is on the cusp of allowing one of Murray\u2019s most trusted former lobbyists to lead the effort.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works held a confirmation hearing for Andrew Wheeler, Trump\u2019s nominee to run the Environmental Protection Agency. Wheeler has been effectively running the agency as acting administrator since July, when Scott Pruitt resigned amid a deluge of ethical scandals. But Trump only formally nominated Wheeler to lead the EPA last week, triggering a confirmation process that Democrats are using to shine light on an unsavory fact: As a lobbyist for Faegre Baker Daniels, Wheeler earned more than $700,000 working for an industry he\u2019s in charge of regulating.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to care about this potential conflict of interest, because they\u2019ve confirmed Wheeler before; his ascent to EPA acting administrator was an automatic promotion from his Senate-confirmed role as deputy administrator. But Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse used Wednesday\u2019s hearing to argue that Wheeler had hidden information from the Senate about his relationship with the coal company."

    "text": "In many ways, Wheeler is similar to Pruitt. Both men are climate-change deniers who speak in a disciplined legalese, thereby avoiding political gaffes. But environmentalists should consider Wheeler a more egregious nominee. His conflicts of interests are certainly worse: Pruitt may have worked closely with the fossil fuel industry before taking office, but Wheeler worked for the fossil fuel industry. Before he took office, Pruitt indirectly raised money from conservative dark money groups to stop the EPA regulations he\u2019s now in charge of. But Wheeler directly raised money for the same Republican Senators who are evaluating his nomination, the Intercept reported on Wednesday.\n\nWhen Pruitt worked with polluters, he did so to advance his own political career; when Wheeler did it, he helped advance the career of Inhofe, the Senate\u2019s most outspoken denier. Wheeler also publicly defended alt-right hero Milo Yiannopolous, who was banned from Twitter after he directed his Twitter followers to hurl racist abuse at comedian Leslie Jones.\n\nPruitt hasn\u2019t decided whether to challenge the endangerment finding, the EPA document that deems carbon dioxide a pollutant that should be regulated under the Clean Air Act. On Tuesday, Kaufman reported that Wheeler \u201ccould be the man to lead that assault,\u201d because the document was based on a scientific report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change:\n\nIn March 2010, [Wheeler] accused the IPCC of blurring \u201cthe lines between science and advocacy\u201d and functioning \u201cmore as a political body than a scientific body.\u201d He suggested the EPA could \u201creconsider its endangerment finding without almost exclusively relying upon the IPCC,\u201d according to remarks posted to his website.\n\nAnd yet, considering how Senate Democrats challenged Pruitt during his confirmation hearing, there hasn\u2019t yet been much public outcry from Senate Democrats about Wheeler. His confirmation hearing in November was an opportunity for Democrats to raise hell, and to be fair, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse was prepared with intense questioning about Wheeler\u2019s ties to Murray Energy. But as The Washington Post pointed out, Democrats as a whole \u201ctrained most of their critical fire\u201d on Kathleen Hartnett-White, Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality. They was effective: Last week, Trump withdrew Hartnett-White\u2019s nomination. But Wheeler\u2019s nomination remains, and as Kaufman noted on Tuesday, \u201cDemocrats seem more at ease\u201d with it. \u201cNo Democrat raised concerns about Wheeler last week during Pruitt\u2019s first Senate hearing since taking office,\u201d Kaufman wrote.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of ammunition against Wheeler, if Democrats want it. Just like Pruitt, Wheeler has criticized Trump harshly in the past. In 2016, he called the president a \u201cbully\u201d who should have been \u201cdisqualified\u201d from running his campaign. Also like Pruitt, Wheeler\u2019s concerns about Trump have suddenly vanished. Perhaps he no longer believes Trump is a bully, or perhaps he sees an opportunity to accomplish what his bosses at Murray have wanted for years: the swift destruction of the environmental regulatory state. If and when Pruitt leaves the agency, he\u2019ll have a perfect successor in place to do just that."

    ],
    "text": "The antagonists in these stories are not always who you\u2019d expect. As if intended to frustrate critics eager to slap a #MeToo sticker on the book, several stories flip the usual scripts of power. The female narrator of \u201cScarred\u201d imprisons and tortures a man in order to harvest from him the blood and tears that her dark magic spells require. In \u201cDeath Wish,\u201d a petite woman insists on being life-threateningly beaten by her reluctant Tinder date. (We already know what he\u2019s going to do\u2014Roupenian seldom pulls a punch.) \u201cThe Night Runner\u201d has a feckless Peace Corps teacher terrorized by his class of Kenyan schoolgirls because he refuses to beat them; they hurl garbage at him and mock his feline eyes, making him the sorrier of the collection\u2019s two cat people. And in \u201cSardines,\u201d a jilted woman fantasizes about \u201cswapping the lube in [her ex\u2019s] girlfriend\u2019s bedroom drawer with superglue, tying her down and tattooing slut across her face.\u201d True to form, what ends up happening to the girlfriend is considerably worse.\n\nBut not all the stories are so easily reduced to pure will-to-power scenarios, and one of its standouts, \u201cThe Boy in the Pool,\u201d is an unexpectedly sweet story about a woman planning a bachelorette party for her former high school crush. She manipulates a has-been actor into becoming a glorified escort and live-reenacting the bride-to-be\u2019s favorite sex scene from the TV horror movie he once starred in. Though the outcome is heartwarming rather than chest-ripping, the book\u2019s themes still lurk in the wings: The actor\u2019s appeal is that he\u2019s \u201ca boy who will kiss your feet and be grateful for it, a boy who suffers, a boy who will suffer for you\u201d; in the film, a straight-to-video schlockfest called Blood Sins, he has a phrase carved into his body: \u201cLove breeds monsters.\u201d With this the book reaffirms its commitment to christening even the tenderest story with at least a drop of blood.\n\nClearly none of this will appeal to the squeamish, to anyone who\u2019s not in the market for \u201ca puddle of sentient, erupting flesh\u201d or a \u201cgushing surge of dark red blood.\u201d You\u2019ll probably also want to pass if moral gray zones are your thing, since, as in \u201cCat Person,\u201d the endings tend to eschew nuance in favor of clarity and intensity. Sometimes this makes the gore less gothic than goofy. The prose is intelligent, though generally plain and conversational, with the occasional whoopsie-doodle of a clich\u00e9 (\u201cIt started to get under our skin,\u201d \u201clithe as a cat,\u201d \u201cburst into tears,\u201d \u201cdissolved into tears\u201d). You could call Roupenian\u2019s approach to description spare if you\u2019re feeling generous, vague if not.\n\nThe big exception is when she aims for the stomach, as when she describes a writhing blood-slick parasite as \u201ca six-inch-long tube of knobbed white flesh, lined with a thousand shivering legs that wave like seaweed.\u201d She slathers even the most innocuous pastoral imagery with erotic Baudelairean macabre, as in this description of a forest:\n\n\n\nThe vaginal lips of a pink lady\u2019s slipper peep out from behind some bushes; a rubber shred of burst balloon, studded by a plump red navel knot, dangles from a tree branch, and the corpse of a crushed mushroom gleams sad and cold and pale.\n\n\n\nYou can see how the book deals with feelings viscerally, an approach neatly symbolized by the recurring images of corrupted hearts. Here the human heart is not the poetic locus of love, but the pulsing, fallible organ pumping atop our livers, or beneath our floorboards. It first appears in the epigraph: \u201cThere is something jerking in your ribcage / that is not a heart / It is cow-intestine white / & fibrous & gilled.\u201d The anti-hearts of this book are not healed or changed; they\u2019re carved from chests and infested with parasites. The heart is a lonely hunter, deceitful above all else, it wants what it wants, and when it shows up, it\u2019s never good news\u2014you\u2019ll know exactly what Roupenian means when the softboy protagonist of \u201cThe Good Guy\u201d calls a woman his \u201csweetheart.\u201d\n\nThe heart is a lonely hunter, deceitful above all else, it wants what it wants, and when it shows up, it\u2019s never good news.\n\nAnd about that\u2014if you do want more \u201cCat Person,\u201d then \u201cThe Good Guy,\u201d the collection\u2019s best and longest story, is the perfect follow-up: a 50-pager that plumbs the benthic depths of just how manipulative and self-serving a guy can be, while genuinely seeing himself as a loyal, blameless ally. \u201cGood-old friendly, utterly dishonest Ted\u201d is someone who considers himself a nice guy while acknowledging the perils of being a \u201cNice Guy\u201d; who says things to women like \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. That sounds really hard,\u201d but only achieves erection by \u201cpretend[ing] that his dick was a knife, and the woman he was fucking was stabbing herself with it.\u201d The story does the emotional autopsy of \u201cCat Person\u201d from the vantage of the cryptocreep, and it\u2019ll have you covering your eyes and reading through your fingers. \u201cBiter,\u201d the final story, also offers a bit of #MeToo catharsis and thematic closure, as a victim of sexual harassment discovers a way to get revenge and provide cover for her own dark appetite.\n\nAlthough You Know You Want This may be timely in its occasional adjacency to #MeToo, its real canniness comes from apprehending the psychology not only of power, but of power-hunger as, itself, a form of weakness: how people harbor an impulse toward sadistic narcissism, and how little it takes for them to succumb to it. Taken together, the uncommonly clear moral of these dark fables is that, given enough of an opportunity, even the kindest, most thoughtful people can be driven to gleefully, passionately hurt and exploit others just to satisfy their desires. Those without consciences will conscript you into their grotesque fantasies, turn you into whomever they want you to be, wreaking any amount of targeted violence and collateral damage; if you survive, you\u2019ll be left to catalog your scars. Power only inflames this tendency and helps people get away with it.\n\nSpeaking of power, seeing how readers approach Roupenian\u2019s collection will surely say something about us: No matter the book\u2019s merit, maybe we\u2019ll act on the perverse desire to see the much-hyped book tank, flop, or disappoint the standards of literature or feminism, just to feed our sadistic inner critic its blood meal of schadenfreude. That would only redound to Roupenian\u2019s success, because she knows we want this."

    ],
    "text": "In his first year in office, Donald Trump and his administration have launched a daunting number of direct and open attacks on long-respected American rights and freedoms\u2014threatening immigrants, the media, health care, transgender rights in the military, and much else. But there have been other, indirect and behind-the-scenes attacks, too, which may be no less damaging to the United States in the long term.\n\nPerhaps the most critical of these is aimed at the census. Under Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution, \u201cthe whole number of persons in each State\u201d must be counted \u201cevery \u2026 ten years.\u201d Based on these decennial census results, the government decides, among other things, what to spend on schools, where to direct funding for health care and infrastructure, and how to allocate our representatives in Congress and in state legislatures. But under the Trump administration, the census, which has serious implications for the rights and daily lives of all Americans, seems likely to prove to be both unfair and inaccurate, and its consequences will remain in place for at least the next ten years\u2014until the next census.\n\nThe history of the census is controversial. As originally drafted, the constitutional provision calling for the decennial census followed the three-fifths clause, which stated that the count of citizens would include, in addition to \u201cfree Persons,\u201d \u201cthree-fifths of all other Persons.\u201d In other words, the census, as initially embedded in our founding document, was based on the dehumanization of enslaved people. Moreover, census results have in certain instances been improperly used. Most notoriously, during World War II the War Department used existing census records to compile a database of citizens and foreign nationals thought to be dangerous. This enabled the internment of Japanese-Americans after the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nIn the latter half of the twentieth century, the United States took significant steps to address these problems. In 1978, Congress passed legislation establishing the \u201c72-Year Rule,\u201d which prohibits the release of personally identifiable information about an individual until 72 years after it was collected for the decennial census. This rule and other privacy protections surrounding the census have been vigorously enforced: In 1980, for example, FBI agents went to a Census Bureau office in Colorado Springs with warrants authorizing them to seize documents there. They were turned away by a census employee, and the dispute escalated to include both the Census Bureau director and the director of the FBI. It ended with an agreement that only sworn census employees would review census documents, but that they would provide a report for the FBI\u2014excluding all confidential information. And in 2000, Census Director Kenneth Prewitt apologized for the role that the census played in the internment of Japanese-Americans."

    "text": "The series of strikes shaking Damascus and its southern countryside last Friday night now appear to have been the most extensive wave of airstrikes by Israel against Iranian-linked targets in Syria since September. They also came only a day after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s high-profile anti-Iran speech in Cairo, part of his week-long tour of the Middle East which, along with National Security Adviser John Bolton\u2019s visit, were intended to reassure U.S. allies following President Trump\u2019s abrupt decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria. Taken together, the events indicate Israel feels it can not rely on the U.S. in its efforts to counter Iran\u2019s regional ambitions. Without either the U.S. or Russia stepping in to constrain Iran, Israel will keep striking targets in Syria, thus increasing the chances of a large-scale conflagration.\n\nSince late 2012, Israel has carried out thousands of airstrikes in Syria, intending to disrupt the transfer of advanced weaponry from Iran to Lebanese Hezbollah through Syria, and prevent the establishment of permanent Iranian bases in the war-torn country. Following Russian intervention in the Syrian war in September 2015, Israel and Russia came to an agreement allowing Israel to continue carrying out such strikes. Under the deal hammered out between Jerusalem and Moscow, Russian servicemen stationed inside the anti-aircraft batteries Russia deploys in Syria would switch off their systems once Israel notified Russia of an impending strike, minutes in advance.\n\nIn September 2018, however, all of this came to a screeching halt when, in response to an Israeli airstrike, Syrian air defenses accidentally shot down a Russian military aircraft, killing all 15 crew members on board. Russia blamed Israel for the death of its soldiers, transferred advanced air defense batteries\u2014the S-300 and S-400\u2014to the Syrian military, stopped turning off Russian air defense systems, and demanded that Israel notify Russia hours in advance of every strike. Initially, Israel halted all attacks in Syria, but then began carrying out smaller strikes. Yesterday\u2019s attack, apparently hitting four different locations, is the largest since September, signaling Israel\u2019s insistence on continuing to counter Iran\u2019s efforts to ferry weapons to Hezbollah.\n\nInconsistent policy out of Washington has complicated this situation since the beginning.\n\nInconsistent policy out of Washington has complicated this situation since the beginning. There\u2019s also ample reason to believe it has helped trigger Israel\u2019s recommitment to airstrikes within the country. Since Trump\u2019s election, Israeli officials have voiced frustration about the disparity between the Trump administration\u2019s bellicose anti-Iran rhetoric and its conduct on the ground. While some administration officials attempted to transform the U.S.\u2019s anti-ISIS intervention in Syria to one intended to stymie Iranian expansionism, Trump rebuffed such efforts. Instead, his sudden announcement in December of the decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from Syria dashed whatever hope remained among Israeli policy-makers that the U.S. would help counter Iranian ambitions in the region. In this context, the aggressive language toward Iran in Pompeo\u2019s Cairo speech on Thursday, only highlights the disparity between U.S. actions and rhetoric."

At the same time, it\u2019s never in the national interest for an American president to subordinate himself to a foreign government to win the presidency, and then cover it up.\n\nA debate over when it\u2019s appropriate for the FBI to investigate a president\u2019s loyalty to America may seem straightforward to Trump\u2019s political opponents. Beyond him, however, there\u2019s reason to be uncomfortable. Presidents often make decisions that their critics say will harm American national security: Many on the left opposed George W. Bush\u2019s decision to invade Iraq, while most Republicans challenged Barack Obama\u2019s diplomatic moves with Cuba and Iran. Trusting FBI officials to determine when a democratically elected president is a threat to American interests should not be done lightly, even if one is confident in the integrity of the bureau\u2019s current leadership. The FBI under J. Edgar Hoover, Goldsmith notes, had a history of misusing its counterintelligence functions to quietly shape public policy.\n\n\u201cBecause the president determines the U.S. national security interest and threats against it, at least for the executive branch, there is an argument that it makes no sense for the FBI to open a counterintelligence case against the president premised on his being a threat to the national security,\u201d Goldsmith wrote. \u201cThe president defines what a national security threat is, and thus any action by him cannot be such a threat, at least not for purposes of opening a counterintelligence investigation.\u201d\n\nBolstering his analysis here is the nuance and humility with which he approaches it. \u201cI am not sure this analysis or this conclusion is right\u2014as I note, the situation [is] unprecedented in many ways,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut I am confident that there is an important Article II question lurking here\u201d\u2014a reference to the section of the Constitution that sets forth the president\u2019s executive authority\u2014\u201cand I suspect this question is what underlies what the Times twice said was a controversy among former FBI and Justice Department officials about the appropriateness of the FBI\u2019s step.\u201d\n\nThis is the right approach to thinking about this question. Without our having all of the information that was available to the FBI\u2019s senior leadership when they made the call, it\u2019s hard to definitively gauge its justification. The Times article is curiously silent on who exactly ordered the investigation, and whether senior Justice Department officials like Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein were aware of it in advance. Mueller\u2019s eventual report may yet shed more light on this, and historians will be even better positioned to weigh the evidence. Until then, there are some basic principles that can guide our analysis."

    ],
    "text": "The Never Trump movement of disaffected conservatives emerged almost as soon as Trump became the presumptive nominee in 2016. George Will, the eminent conservative columnist, left the Republican Party that June, weeks before the Republican National Convention. The convention itself was raucous, with numerous challenges to Trump\u2019s nomination. Later in the summer, former CIA officer Evan McMullin announced an independent presidential campaign, and was endorsed by a host of Never Trumpers, including Weekly Standard founder Bill Kristol, National Review columnist Jonah Goldberg, and Hillbilly Elegy author J.D. Vance. He received 700,000 votes, finishing behind the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein and Libertarian Gary Johnson.\n\n\n\nMcMullin\u2019s campaign played well in conservative media circles, in part because his campaign was geared toward voters who were fearful of Trump\u2019s inexperience and ideological heresies, yet unwilling to vote for Hillary Clinton. But those susceptible to this appeal, then as now, are few. Despite abysmal polling numbers with voters broadly, Trump is, historically speaking, more popular with Republicans than any other president, including Ronald Reagan. (Only post-9/11 George W. Bush can compete with him.) Even in the midst of an unpopular government shutdown that he gleefully took credit for, his numbers remain strong among Republicans. Only 15 percent blame him for the shutdown, while 69 percent blame congressional Democrats.\n\n\n\nHayes\u2019s argument, like many that preceded it, makes a moral and political case for challenging Trump: Republicans must stand up in opposition to the \u201csteady stream of lies\u201d emanating from Trump\u2019s Twitter feed, his authoritarian desire to declare a national emergency to build a border wall, and his chaotic approach to foreign policy. Hayes concludes that a primary challenge is unlikely to \u201cdo more damage to Trump\u2019s reelection effort than Trump has done himself,\u201d and insists that such a challenge would not be hopeless. \u201cAnd as Trump supporters should understand better than most, the volatility of the current political moment means that things \u2018everyone knows\u2019 cannot happen sometimes do,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFor the good of the country, sometimes it\u2019s vital that they do.\u201d\n\n\n\nNever Trump arguments like these have been amplified for a number of reasons, but not because they\u2019re widely popular. Trump\u2019s detractors are overrepresented in Washington media and regularly appear on mainstream media programs, particularly shows like Meet the Press, which attempt to present ideological balance. The thought of a primary challenge has a rich political history, most recently in Reagan\u2019s challenge to Gerald Ford in 1976 and Ted Kennedy\u2019s campaign against Jimmy Carter in 1980. Finally, intraparty conflict is the kind of story that whets the appetite of any horse-race journalist.\n\n\n\nBut if moral case for challenging Trump is clear, the political case is anything but. His approval rating with his party has only climbed in recent months amid the very news that Hayes deems damaging: In late December, 89 percent of Republicans approved of his job performance. It\u2019s difficult to imagine what else Trump could do that would suddenly change these supporters\u2019 minds\u2014especially not if the choice is between him and a \u201creasonable\u201d alternative who is selling a watered-down alternative to Trump\u2019s immigration policies, a comparable fiscal policy (minus the trade war, which Republican voters have embraced), and a hawkish foreign policy that is increasingly on the outs in both parties.\n\n"

(Perhaps, like some Democrats, they\u2019re afraid that Ocasio-Cortez might scold them on Twitter.) Speaking on background, though, some said the letter did not allow for enough flexibility on the details of a Green New Deal\u2014such as one section promising that all signatories will \u201cvigorously oppose\u201d a deal that includes \u201cmarket-based mechanisms and technology options such as carbon and emissions trading and offsets, carbon capture and storage, nuclear power, waste-to-energy and biomass energy.\u201d\n\nDominique Browning, the co-founder of Mom\u2019s Clean Air Force, wasn\u2019t shy about putting her criticisms on the record. She noted that the letter characterized market-based solutions to climate change\u2014such as carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems\u2014as \u201ccorporate schemes that place profits over community burdens and benefits.\u201d This can be true, Browning said, but \u201cequity and environmental integrity factors could be built into those mechanisms.\u201d\n\nBrowning also took issue with the letter\u2019s rejection of \u201ccarbon capture and storage,\u201d the technology that removes greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and stores them\u2014either in concrete blocks, or deep underground. Yes, she said, the technology is unproven and not cost-effective\u2014for now. \u201cWhy at this point would we shut off research and development into any possible technological solution that might get us out of this mess?\u201d she asked. \u201cWho knows yet what will be the answer, or answers?\u201d\n\n\n\nSome non-signatories sought to draw a distinction between their groups and the groups that signed the letter. Andrea McGimsey of Environment America\u2014which advocates for federal environmental policy changes, in part by lobbying\u2014said that she and her organization \u201cwholeheartedly support the [letter\u2019s] call for 100 percent renewable energy.\u201d But, she added, \u201cMuch of the rest of the plan is outside our lane.\u201d Jake Thompson, a spokesperson for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the group was supportive of the \u201cexciting momentum behind a new grassroots call to arms, embodied in part by initiatives like the emerging Green New Deal.\u201d\n\nBut for other non-signatories, the issue seemed that they simply aren\u2019t ready to commit to what must\u2014and must not\u2014be in the Green New Deal. \u201cWe are working collaboratively with a wide array of groups\u2014including many of those on this letter\u2014plus frontline communities and members of Congress to develop bold Green New Deal policies that can tackle the climate crisis, create high paying jobs, and counteract racial and economic inequity at the speed and scale that justice demands,\u201d Ben Beachy, the director of Sierra Club\u2019s Living Economy campaign, said in an emailed statement. \u201cBuilding a more inclusive economy requires an inclusive process.\u201d"

      "Micah L. Sifry"
    ],
    "text": "With the rise of today\u2019s internet-powered protest movements, some have argued, as Zeynep Tufekci does in her recent book Twitter and Tear Gas, that we need to respect the accomplishment of the 1963 March: Because it was logis\u00adtically a huge lift to organize an event of this scale in the pre-internet age, the activists had to develop strong structures, which then signaled to the authorities that this movement had the capacity to navigate other challenges\u2014like negotiating with the administration over civil rights. And indeed, there was a subtle dance at work between the leaders, who insisted on marching, and the Kennedy White House, which did its best to both embrace the march\u2019s symbolism and contain its substance. Kauffman is making a more subversive claim: that King and his confreres left much of the civil rights movement\u2019s real potential power unmobilized by insisting on such a rigid, top-down, patriarchal approach.\n\nA protester at the Women\u2019s March in January 2017 recreates a popular poster. Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post/Getty\n\nLater generations of activists rebelled against this style of organizing, in the more freewheeling antiwar marches of the 1960s and \u201970s, and in the gay and lesbian rights, women\u2019s rights, and labor rallies of the \u201970s, \u201980s, \u201990s, and \u201900s to the raucous present. Never again has there been a mass march whose marshals so effectively controlled what participants could say; not even the AFL-CIO\u2019s 1981 Solidarity Day rally, which also drew 250,000 people. As Kauffman shows with a wonderful array of well-selected archival photos, today\u2019s protests are do-it-yourself affairs. And with the advent of social media, it\u2019s become impossible to determine which matters more, memes online or posters on the ground, as street protests get amplified in real time by marchers who are simultaneously observing one another and sharing the messages that resonate most.\n\nTo Kauffman, the \u201cbottom-up, women-led\u201d organization of the more than 650 coordinated Women\u2019s Marches in early 2017 \u201cgave them a powerful and unprecedented movement-building impact.\u201d This is a bold claim and one that feels intuitively right. The Women\u2019s Marches laid the groundwork for much of the Resistance organizing of the last two years: Women make up most of the leadership and activist base of Indivisible, which was born in the same postelection moment and now has more than 6,000 local chapters (six times as many as the Tea Party\n\never claimed). And in the buildup to the 2018 elections, 65 percent of the more than 320,000 people who signed up on MobilizeAmerica\u2019s online clearinghouse to canvass for Democratic political candidates were women.\n\nKauffman celebrates the diverse and inclusive approach of the Women\u2019s Marches\u2014reflected both in the intersectional language of the national March\u2019s call and in the millions of homemade signs that participants carried. Indeed, so many people made their own signs for these marches, Kauffman explains, that retailers had trouble keeping up with demand. \u201cIn just the week before people marched around the country, some two million poster boards were sold nationwide,\u201d she notes. The protest wasn\u2019t centralized, but distributed across the country: While about 800,000 people attended the main rally in Washington, D.C., over 1.2 million joined in more than 20 marches in California. Many local march leaders have stayed active; I\u2019ve heard of local groups that formed on the bus ride home from that first D.C. march. The California marches formed a federation and hired an executive director. A coalition of local leaders in more conservative areas formed a parallel group, March On, and organizers of marches outside the United States have formed the Women\u2019s March Global organization.\n\nBut while the on-the-ground truth of the Women\u2019s March movement is that it is leader-full and decentralized, the star-making machinery of American culture, including protest culture, still requires leaders who are supposed to symbolically and literally speak for the movement. This is nearly an impossible role to succeed in, and it has fallen to the movement\u2019s co-chairs Bob Bland, Carmen Perez, Tamika Mallory, and Linda Sarsour to wrestle with its complexity. The 2017 Women\u2019s March started out with Bland and Teresa Shook, who separately posted about the idea of a march in the hours after Trump\u2019s surprise victory. Yet as interest mounted, leaders realized, as they later explained, that the women \u201cwho initially started organizing were almost all white\u201d and that they needed a diverse leadership, not least because the majority of\n\nwhite women voted for Trump. Perez, Mallory and Sarsour\u2014three women of color who were experienced organizers and leaders in causes like criminal justice reform and Muslim-American rights\u2014joined two weeks after Shook\u2019s first post.\n\nThere was poetic and real justice in the Women\u2019s March both continuing the work of the 1963 March, while exploding its model.\n\n\u201cThe naming of the co-chairs,\u201d Kauffman writes, \u201ccreated both direct and symbolic links with the organizing of the 1963 March on Washington.\u201d In particular, Mallory had been a lead organizer of the 50th Anniversary March on Washington in 2013. She contacted King\u2019s daughter Bernice King, and got her permission to rename their emerging effort the \u201cWomen\u2019s March on Washington,\u201d echoing the name of the 1963 protest. So there was poetic and real justice in the Women\u2019s March both continuing the work of the 1963 March, while exploding its model and making space for voices that had earlier been ignored.\n\nAt the same time, in a movement born on Facebook and forged in virtual back channels, the relationship between the national March leaders and its adherents is inherently unstable. The Women\u2019s March has no official membership structure, so it\u2019s unclear to whom its leaders have to be responsive. This is true of many of today\u2019s digitally driven causes, but the fact that the March\u2019s national leaders have more radical politics than many of the middle-class, middle-aged white women in its base only adds to the challenge. Over the past year, Tamika Mallory and Linda Sarsour have, for instance, drawn outsize levels of criticism for statements they have made about Louis Farrakhan and Palestinian rights respectively, with some critics arguing that they are soft on anti-Semitism. This has led one prominent March supporter, actress Alyssa Milano, to withdraw from speaking at the 2019 March, and prompted a fair amount of hand-wringing within local groups about what it means to affiliate with the national March.\n\nKauffman, a veteran observer of and participant in mass movement organizing, skates past the issue of internal decision-making. The story of the marches, she writes, is that \u201cpeople at the grassroots level spontaneously organized themselves, and organizers everywhere were constantly scrambling to keep up.\u201d Again, this is intuitively right, but it\u2019s not a fully satisfying answer either. As the current tensions inside the Women\u2019s March show, decentralized movements still need unified visions and stable brands even if no one wants to go back to the days of volunteer marshals telling people what signs they can wave. The early days of a movement are always messy; there\u2019s a good reason that Nicholas von Hoffman told his mentor Saul Alinsky, the great community organizer, that their methodical ways of building local power didn\u2019t make sense in \u201cthe moment of the whirlwind,\u201d when \u201cwe are no longer organizing but guiding a social movement.\u201d\n\nWe need more in-depth journalism about the movements shaping our times, so we can better understand how such developments really take form. Too much of contemporary coverage consists of desk-jockey commentary and the rehashing of leaders\u2019 official statements, rather than on-the-ground reportage. But for a first draft of history still in the making, Kauffman is right to focus on the broad scale and wide impact of the Women\u2019s Marches of 2017. As she persuasively shows, marches need not be the apex of a movement\u2019s rise; they can also be its generative soil. And while King is still celebrated for his seminal speech, and the 1963 March as the one that created the mold, Septima Clark, and her vision of widespread and inclusive leadership, is the true godmother of the present moment.\n\n"

      "Ryu Spaeth"
    ],
    "text": "Chan was enmeshed in the vast underclass of the great Hong Kong economy, which to this day is jam-packed with underpaid laborers from around the world who live stacked on top of each other in dismal apartments the size of coffins. And yet the predominant sense in this memoir is that the obvious inequities of the China Drama Academy particularly and Hong Kong more broadly were outweighed by the amazing opportunities they afforded to a nobody like Chan Kong-Sang. He describes those ten years as his \u201cdecade of darkness,\u201d but, he adds, \u201cIt was in those ten years that I became Jackie Chan.\u201d\n\nIn other words, what to my mind reads like a brutal account of exploitation and abuse is meant to be inspirational, a testament not only to Chan\u2019s personal fortitude, but also to a certain ethic. Indeed, in Chan\u2019s case, the myth of the self-made man, predicated on hard work and sacrifice, is taken to its extreme, for the thing he willingly sacrifices over and over again, year in and year out, is his body. The China Drama Academy primarily contributed to Chan\u2019s success in three ways: It facilitated lifelong friendships with fellow entertainers, like Sammo Hung, who in the early days got him jobs, then went on to co-star in some of his most famous movies; it prepared him for stuntwork and trained him in martial arts, which were his calling cards in Hong Kong\u2019s down-and-dirty film industry; and it turned his body into an instrument that could withstand ungodly amounts of pain.\n\nOne of his first breaks came when a director demanded a perilous stunt\u2014a tumbling leap from a high balcony\u2014without a wire to catch the stuntman if it went awry. The stunt coordinator refused to let any of his men perform it. Then Chan volunteered, breaking what amounted to an ad hoc labor strike. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d the coordinator asked. \u201cAre you tired of living?\u201d Chan, of course, pulled off the stunt\u2014twice\u2014establishing his reputation as a daredevil. As he started to star in his own films, culminating in his 1978 breakthrough Drunken Master, original stuntwork became one of his defining traits, alongside his comedic mien. \u201cI always perform my own stunts,\u201d he promises to readers, \u201cno matter how dangerous.\u201d And with that came scores of injuries, which were then showed to audiences after the movie was over, in a highlight reel as the credits rolled. These injuries included a disastrous fall during the filming of Armour of God (1986) that nearly killed him.\n\nIn his memoir, Chan proudly recounts the body parts he has shattered over the course of his career: nose, jaw, ankle, cranium. \u201cMy leg sometimes gets dislocated when I\u2019m showering,\u201d he writes of the toll his work has taken on him. \u201cI need my assistant to help me click it back in.\u201d This is presented as evidence of his dedication to the craft. It is also what makes him exceptional\u2014not his brilliance or his smile or any other quality, but an almost masochistic willingness to risk his life for the camera. Those highlight reels, full of impossible leaps from the tops of buildings and other brushes with death, became the hallmark of his movies, more memorable than their plots or characters. By the time Rumble in the Bronx came around in the 1990s, Chan\u2019s antics represented the awesome possibilities of what a human being could do on screen, soon to be surpassed by the hypnotic fireworks of CGI. But read as a Hong Kong success story, it leaves the unfortunate impression that the only way to make it in this town was to literally almost kill yourself with work.\n\nIt is a shame that Chan is unable to evoke in his writing the joyful magic of a Jackie Chan fight scene. The combatants often work in an improbably tight space, with a few props that either shift position or are smashed to pieces, so that the space changes in surprising ways, as if some unexpected dimension of reality is continually unfolding before your eyes.\n\nIt is a shame, too, that Chan does not say much about his filmmaking style. His Hong Kong, for example, is not that of John Woo (who pioneered the gritty, hardboiled aesthetic of action movies much imitated by Quentin Tarantino) or Wong Kar Wai (all sharp angles and reflections and harsh light, where even the raindrops are lambent with neon). It is something plainer, more straightforward, a bit ugly even: milky-gray sky, drab office interiors, identical white apartment blocks rising from the green hills with the regularity of a picket fence. The principal charm of this aesthetic, like a yellowing photograph, comes from age, dating Hong Kong to a specific moment in the 1980s and early 1990s, when it was at its peak and looking toward the 1997 handover to China with equal measures of hope and trepidation.\n\nThe reader is left not with a reminder of Jackie Chan\u2019s genius, but with the rather sad story of his very successful life. It is an old colonial tale, the hapless provincial who becomes worldly, though in Chan\u2019s case he doesn\u2019t evolve beyond being a clownish parvenu. He writes about it with his usual high spirits: \u201cHow did it feel to go from being flat broke to being a millionaire, practically overnight? To go from being an uneducated loser to being a famous star? It was fantastic!\u201d He drinks all the time. He totals expensive cars and buys new ones. He spends millions of dollars on fancy watches, chases beautiful women, and licenses a Jackie Chan brand of Australian wines. After he stars in Rush Hour with Chris Tucker in 1998, he becomes a bona fide star in America, producing a series of comic-action movies in his middle to old age that make him richer and more famous still.\n\nJackie Chan as Chief Inspector Lee and Chris Tucker as Detective James Carter in 1998\u2019s \u201cRush Hour.\u201d Photofest\n\nHe marries and has a child\u2014named Jaycee, after his own initials J.C.\u2014but he hardly ever sees his family because he is constantly working. (He also has a child out of wedlock though this only warrants an offhand sentence.) He is at his most self-aware when discussing his workaholism. \u201cWhen I was young, people looked down on me,\u201d he writes. \u201cAs a young adult, I lived in poverty. When I finally found success, I was driven to give the world one good film after another, to show everyone what I was worth.\u201d He is rich beyond his wildest dreams, but is unable to shed the poor young man he once was, a person desperate for work and afraid of the abyss that could open up at his feet at any moment. His poverty is a wound that never quite heals.\n\nThose searing experiences have not translated into a sympathetic politics. As Hong Kong was absorbed by China, and as the mainland\u2019s own cities came to rival Hong Kong for wealth and power, it held on to the one trait that truly made it a British colony, which is that it was not a democracy. It would appear that Chan would like to keep it that way, viewing Hong Kong\u2019s democratic movement as a blemish on its reputation for frictionless commerce and order. \u201cHong Kong has become a city of protest,\u201d he complained in 2012. \u201cPeople scold China\u2019s leaders, or anything else they like, and protest against everything.\u201d In 2009 he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it is better to have freedom or to have no freedom. With too much freedom, it can get very chaotic. It could end up like in Taiwan.\u201d He added, \u201cChinese people need to be controlled, otherwise they will do whatever they want.\u201d Indeed, China\u2019s authoritarian-capitalist model, with its billion-plus consumers looking to spend time at the movies, suits Chan very well. He has moved his base of operations to Beijing and become a kind of soft-power ambassador for the Communist Party. He has made nationalist-inflected movies with a mainland production company.\n\nIn 1996 Jackie Chan climbed the Hollywood sign . Julian Wasser/Hulton Archive/Getty\n\nIf Chan once represented what a Hong Konger could do with a little pluck and a little luck, his relentlessly buoyant memoir offers a different message: Life is hard, so one must be harder. It is an ethos that perhaps has been there all along. Police Story (1985), one of his best movies, concludes with an epic fight scene in a mega department store, that ubiquitous symbol of Hong Kong\u2019s consumer economy. Against a backdrop of designer clothes and jewelry and electronics, Chan fights a whole gang of bad guys, sending them flying into mannequins and tumbling down escalators. There is shattered glass everywhere as bodies slam through display cases and storefronts. At one point, inexplicably, a motorcycle makes an appearance, careening through more panes of glass. When it looks like the head of the gang is about to get away, Chan leaps from the store\u2019s top story onto a giant pole festooned with lights, sliding all the way down in a shower of electric sparks. (In his memoir he reveals he shouted the words \u201cI die!\u201d as he jumped.) He crashes into more glass at the bottom, and in one unbroken motion gets up and keeps fighting.\n\nIt remains a breathtaking scene, combining everything audiences have come to love about Jackie Chan: athleticism, derring-do, an everyman\u2019s goodness. But there is something disturbing about it, too, the way Chan is both destroying and being destroyed by this mall. There is blood on his face, after all. And the blood is real."

      "Matt Ford"
    ],
    "text": "If the president directs you to open a criminal investigation into his political opponents, will you refuse?\n\nIn addition to arguing that the attorney general should protect him from politically damaging investigations, Trump has shown a desire to use the Justice Department against his opponents. He led \u201cLock her up!\u201d chants during the 2016 campaign, and during a presidential debate, threatened to jail Clinton if he were elected. Earlier this year, The New York Times reported that he tried to order the Justice Department to open investigations into Clinton and Comey, though he ultimately demurred on the abuse of power.\n\nThis is the stuff of Old World dictatorships, not a mature liberal democracy. Few things could be more corrosive to free government than wielding the powers of state to criminalize political opposition. Trump may not show similar restraint in the future, especially if his own legal and political situation becomes more precarious. Barr should be willing to state under oath that he would not carry out such an order.\n\nWill you also rebuff Trump if he directs you to violate federal law or the Constitution?\n\nIn an interview last month, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made the casual admission that he frequently had to persuade the president not to break the law. \u201cSo often, the president would say here\u2019s what I want to do and here\u2019s how I want to do it,\u201d he told CBS News\u2019 Bob Schieffer, \u201cand I would have to say to him, \u2018Mr. President, I understand what you want to do, but you can\u2019t do it that way. It violates the law. It violates [a] treaty.\u2019\u201d (Trump responded by calling Tillerson \u201cdumb as a rock.\u201d)\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first sign that Trump shows little fidelity to the American rule of law or constitutional governance. He routinely castigates federal judges for ruling against his legally dubious policies or for their ethnic ancestry, and suggested last November that he would bypass the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of birthright citizenship by executive order. Tillerson\u2019s account only highlights the need for cabinet officials who will place their oaths to defend the Constitution above their loyalty to the president.\n\nWill you release Mueller\u2019s report to the public if he writes one, and give him final authority over any redactions from it?\n\nUnder Justice Department regulations, the special counsel can submit a report on his findings to the attorney general at the conclusion of his or her investigation. There are persistent rumors that Mueller is currently drafting such a report, though the special counsel\u2019s consistent silence makes it hard to determine the trajectory or progress of his inquiry. What happens to the report from there is unclear; some have expressed fears that a hostile attorney general could suppress its findings.\n\nThe Mueller report could ultimately give a damning account of foreign collusion and criminal wrongdoing by the president and his associates during the 2016 campaign. It could also fall short of the high expectations held by Trump\u2019s opponents. Whatever its conclusions may be, it will be a valuable record of perhaps the worst attack on the American democratic process in the nation\u2019s history. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters on Wednesday that Barr gave him private assurances that he would \u201cerr on the side of transparency\u201d when it came to releasing Mueller\u2019s report. If that\u2019s the case, he should have no problem giving the Senate a similar pledge next week.\n\nWill you forbid federal law-enforcement officials from taking any public steps, in the 90 days leading up to the 2020 election, that could affect its outcome?\n\nNot every misfortune that befalls American democracy comes at the hands of Donald Trump. One of the most egregious breaches of election norms in recent history came from James Comey, the former FBI director. Less than a fortnight before the election, Comey sent a letter to members of Congress announcing that the FBI had reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state. FBI agents wrapped up the investigation a few days later, having found nothing yet again that would justify criminal charges.\n\nComey\u2019s letter may have changed the course of the 2016 presidential election, and of American history. FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Nate Silver concluded, based on opinion polls taken before and after the letter became public, that Comey\u2019s intervention likely cost Hillary Clinton the presidency. (Some election analysts are more skeptical.) The Justice Department currently has a policy against making any moves that could alter the outcome of an election. Barr should enthusiastically vow to uphold that rule during the 2020 election and beyond.\n\nSenators may also find other good reasons to vote against Barr\u2019s nomination. His track record on criminal-justice matters is especially troubling. He championed harsh and punitive policies during his last stint at the Justice Department, in the early 1990s, that strengthened mass incarceration\u2019s grip on American life. Most experts, including many conservatives, have now embraced reforms that make it easier for prisoners to rejoin society. It\u2019s worth probing whether Barr has had a similar change of heart.\n\nBut it should not be difficult for a public official who believes in the rule of law to answer \u201cyes\u201d to the five questions above. If he refuses to do so, the Senate should roundly reject his nomination."

    "text": "There aren\u2019t easy answers to this question in this circumstance. Since Goldsmith has already laid out the tentative case for concern about the FBI\u2019s actions, it\u2019s worth considering a similarly tentative case in defense of what the bureau reportedly has done. It\u2019s not the FBI\u2019s job to contradict what elected officials decide is in the country\u2019s best interests internationally. At the same time, it\u2019s never in the national interest for an American president to subordinate himself to a foreign government to win the presidency, and then cover it up.\n\nA debate over when it\u2019s appropriate for the FBI to investigate a president\u2019s loyalty to America may seem straightforward to Trump\u2019s political opponents. Beyond him, however, there\u2019s reason to be uncomfortable. Presidents often make decisions that their critics say will harm American national security: Many on the left opposed George W. Bush\u2019s decision to invade Iraq, while most Republicans challenged Barack Obama\u2019s diplomatic moves with Cuba and Iran. Trusting FBI officials to determine when a democratically elected president is a threat to American interests should not be done lightly, even if one is confident in the integrity of the bureau\u2019s current leadership. The FBI under J. Edgar Hoover, Goldsmith notes, had a history of misusing its counterintelligence functions to quietly shape public policy.\n\n\u201cBecause the president determines the U.S. national security interest and threats against it, at least for the executive branch, there is an argument that it makes no sense for the FBI to open a counterintelligence case against the president premised on his being a threat to the national security,\u201d Goldsmith wrote. \u201cThe president defines what a national security threat is, and thus any action by him cannot be such a threat, at least not for purposes of opening a counterintelligence investigation.\u201d\n\nBolstering his analysis here is the nuance and humility with which he approaches it. \u201cI am not sure this analysis or this conclusion is right\u2014as I note, the situation [is] unprecedented in many ways,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut I am confident that there is an important Article II question lurking here\u201d\u2014a reference to the section of the Constitution that sets forth the president\u2019s executive authority\u2014\u201cand I suspect this question is what underlies what the Times twice said was a controversy among former FBI and Justice Department officials about the appropriateness of the FBI\u2019s step.\u201d\n\nThis is the right approach to thinking about this question. Without our having all of the information that was available to the FBI\u2019s senior leadership when they made the call, it\u2019s hard to definitively gauge its justification. The Times article is curiously silent on who exactly ordered the investigation, and whether senior Justice Department officials like Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein were aware of it in advance. Mueller\u2019s eventual report may yet shed more light on this, and historians will be even better positioned to weigh the evidence. Until then, there are some basic principles that can guide our analysis."

    "text": "HBO / Warrick Page\n\nThis time, however, there are three stories. Leaving its delicious production aside, True Detective should be credited with giving us the best aging makeup television has ever seen. This new season spans something like five decades, and never looks wrong.\n\nTimeline A shows Wayne and Roland on the case of a missing pair of children in 1980. Timeline B sees the case re-opened ten years later; Wayne\u2019s hair is shorter and by now he is married, to the lovely schoolteacher named Amelia whom he met in Timeline A. Timeline C is the cruelest: Now in retirement, Wayne is struggling to remember his life through the cloud of dementia. A television crew in the model of the podcast Serial has dug up new evidence on the case, and put him in front of a camera. Slowly and reluctantly, Wayne confronts memories of his marriage (Carmen Ejogo plays Amelia with enigmatic appeal) and of the unsolved case. Between hallucinating his wife and waking up in his bathrobe in the middle of the street, Wayne drags Roland out of retirement for one more crack at the mystery. \u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Wayne says to Roland through old-man tears. \u201cStir some shit up with me.\u201d\n\nSo, yes\u2014this is almost exactly the same TV show that you watched in 2014. But certain changes mark it out. This season features a love story, which adds a little schmaltz and heartache to the proceedings. It\u2019s also much more serious about historical detail. Wayne Hays has the nickname \u201cPurple Haze\u201d from Vietnam, where he learned to track the enemy and suppress his emotions\u2014skills he reprises while on the job. He\u2019s also, obviously, black, working as a cop in the Deep South. While race was a small plot point in season one\u2014the cops who interview the older detectives are both black and Marty calls them \u201cyoung studs\u201d at one point, to raised eyebrows\u2014it is here at the forefront. N-words abound, and color is integral to the relationship between the two main cops.\n\nThe other great difference is Mahershala Ali himself. As the maverick, Matthew McConaughey was great. But Ali manages to outdo him, if only because season three demands so much more. He appears in the majority of scenes in the show, inhabiting three different stages in a single man\u2019s life. The show is eight episodes long, so in terms of screen time it\u2019s as if he has played three different roles in a trio of movies, back to back. The achievement is extraordinary, particularly because he does such a fine job of distinguishing the 30-something man from the 40-something man from the elderly man. The first is restrained but headstrong; the second hamstrung by emotional repression; the last abandoned, almost, to the flood of feeling that he has kept back for so long. His creased regret as an elderly man is impossible not to believe.\n\nIn the first five episodes, at least, there is not much new to True Detective round three in terms of the basic set-up. But in its narrative ambition and the great strength of its star, this show has managed to surpass its original outing. Love and time are the great motifs of True Detective and have been since its beginning. At the end of this triple-layered show, we ought to witness those themes configured in unprecedented dimensions. If nothing else, it should garner Ali better roles, more exposure, and bigger checks: No mystery there."

    "text": "The Clinton campaign\u2019s overconfidence that the \u201cblue wall\u201d would hold has been justly criticized, given that just 80,000 voters across Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin cost her the election. But there\u2019s little evidence that the campaign\u2019s midwestern ground game, and specifically its decision not to campaign in Wisconsin, made the difference. Instead a general lack of electoral enthusiasm, Clinton\u2019s baggage (both overstated and deserved), and the Comey letter proved to be more decisive. Yes, Trump won a record share of the white-working class vote, but the same group of voters made up a quarter of Clinton\u2019s coalition.\n\nDespite the political class\u2019 fixation on economic anxiety, the authors of Identity Crisis found that it was an isolated, partisan phenomenon: Republicans earning more than $100,000 a year were more concerned about the economy than Democrats earning less than $20,000. Instead, cultural anxiety was more decisive. \u201cEconomic anxiety had been decreasing, not increasing, in the eight years before 2016 and any impact it had was muted or at least not particularly distinctive compared to earlier elections,\u201d John Sides, Michael Tesler, and Lynn Vavreck wrote. \u201cWhen economic anxiety was refracted through social identities, however, the combination was potent. The important sentiment was not \u2018I might lose my job\u2019 but, in essence, \u2018People in my group are losing jobs to that other group.\u2019 Instead of a pure economic anxiety, what mattered was \u2018racialized economics.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe argument for Biden is that his blue-collar bona fides and tough talk will win back these voters. \u201cIf you look at Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the labor folks who voted for Trump, they love him,\u201d former Delaware governor Jack Markell told the Times about Biden. \u201cHe has a connection with these people.\u201d But it\u2019s unclear how Biden\u2019s political approach will appeal to voters motivated by cultural anxiety and \u201cracialized economics.\u201d It\u2019s possible that the kind of economic platform that Biden is expected to pitch\u2014one that stops short of Bernie Sanders\u2019s democratic socialism, but nevertheless focuses directly on workers\u2014could be effective here. But there\u2019s nothing about Biden, outside of his identity as an old white man who reps Scranton, that suggests that he can be the only messenger who will be effective in making a dent in Trump\u2019s non-college-educated white base.\n\nFor one thing, as Slate\u2019s Ben Mathis-Lilley notes, \u201cin 2018, Democrats flipped eight House districts that Obama won in 2012 but that Trump won in 2016; of those districts, which are in Biden\u2019s ostensible wheelhouse, five were won by non-white male candidates.\u201d Senators in the Biden mode, like Missouri\u2019s Claire McCaskill and Indiana\u2019s Joe Donnelly\u2014both of whom Biden campaigned for\u2014got walloped. Midterm voting suggests that the blue wall is being rebuilt by a diverse array of candidates, some similar to Biden (like Pennsylvania\u2019s Conor Lamb) and some not (like Michigan\u2019s Rashida Tlaib). There are strong signs that Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin are poised to return to the Democratic fold in 2020, though Ohio, where Republicans expanded their hold on state government, may be lost for good.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Biden is very popular, leading the potential Democratic field by as many as 20 points. But there\u2019s reason to believe that his support is inflated. His significant advantage in name recognition will shrink as the primaries take shape, and the scrutiny of his record will intensify. By sitting out the 2016 primary, Biden\u2019s record largely remained unexamined, thereby preserving his image as an affable, everyman vice president. But there are plenty of blemishes, including his shameful role during the Anita Hill hearings and his role in passing the 1994 crime bill\u2014the virtues of which he continues to extol. He also hasn\u2019t proven to be an effective presidential candidate: His 1988 campaign was derailed by plagiarism accusations, and he dropped out of the 2008 race after getting just 4 percent in the Iowa caucuses."

    "text": "If Kondo wants you to throw out everything that doesn\u2019t feel personal, then Instant Hotel and Stay Here emphasize getting rid of personal effects in order to make the domestic space as generic as possible, the better to profitably enter it into the sharing economy, in which strangers will have to feel like it is their home as well.\n\nStay Here, another Netflix original production, is the highest-budget and most fun of the group in a hate-watch, eat-the-rich kind of way\u2014it could be used for DSA radicalization sessions. Its tagline is \u201cMakeover. Make money.\u201d HGTV star Genevieve Gorder, a charming designer, and Peter Lorimer, a slick British music producer turned celebrity realtor, take properties that are being rented on Airbnb or the more luxe platform VRBO and renovate them so that they are better short-term rentals: the best Airbnb they can be.\n\nAn interior from Netflix\u2019s \u201cStay Here.\u201d Cristopher Nolasco\n\nTheir chief goals are to raise the nightly rental price and occupancy rates. They crunch the numbers on-screen, reassuring the property owners that they will recoup all their mortgage and maintenance expenses plus a tidy profit. They achieve this by bringing in faux-mid century furniture, building out the same open kitchen you see in every new condo development, and adding a \u201csocial media moment,\u201d some Instagrammable object or mural wall that will prompt guests to do your marketing for you. In Austin, it\u2019s a geometric pattern painted on the poolhouse; in Palm Springs, it\u2019s a period-piece 1970s room covered in pink upholstery. Gorder is ecstatic.\n\nLet us consider the case of one gentleman who bought a disused firehouse in Washington, D.C., and turned it into his own apartment as well as an Airbnb. He lived in the huge loft space behind two floor-to-ceiling arched windows and rented out the darkened caverns in the rest of the building, which were filled with furniture barely worthy of a frat house. Gorder and Lorimer obviously kicked him out of the nice part of the house\u2014you have to prioritize the guests\u2014and opened the bright loft to the rest of the space.\n\nIt turns out that the firehouse was the first African-American firehouse in the city, opened because black firemen were having trouble getting promoted by racist white officers. Instead of, say, turning some part of it into a public space, Gorder fetishizes its heritage with bunk beds made of fire-poles and a vintage photo mural of the garage in its active days. \u201cNow you can sleep in a piece of history!\u201d Thus authenticity is commodified as #DCfirehouse4, $850 a night. Also not mentioned is the threat of gentrification that families of wealthy tourists pose to the historically African-American neighborhood.\n\nIn Stay Here, we might observe certain rules for an optimized Airbnb. You need to have as many bedrooms as possible, because \u201cheads in beds\u201d make money. Don\u2019t think of it as a home; \u201cyou have to think like the GM of a small hotel,\u201d bringing a strong business plan. Key to the process is what Gorder persists in calling \u201cdepersonalization\u201d: removing any artifacts like family photos or mementos so that guests won\u2019t feel like they\u2019re in someone else\u2019s life. Depersonalization also happens to be the clinical term for a psychological disorder in which you feel detached from yourself, like a robot. It seems apt. The Stay Here thesis is not that by remaking your house you might be happier; it is that you will be wealthier. \u201cI\u2019m going to crush my competition,\u201d a man in Austin enthuses in a fit of post-renovation real estate Darwinism.\n\nNetflix / Cristopher Nolasco\n\nHomes were not competition until sharing-economy platforms gamified them with revenue charts and star ratings. Instant Hotel gamifies the gamification. The show originally aired in Australia in 2017 before Netflix picked it up. Two sessions of five Australian couples who have turned their houses into rental properties (\u201cinstant hotels\u201d) go on a kind of national road trip, staying together at every other couple\u2019s rental and then evaluating it, often viciously, like a mobile Big Brother. The categories are Design, Location & Attractions, Night\u2019s Sleep, and Value; grand prize is a trip to California to stay in a famous Airbnb that might belong to a celebrity.\n\nPersonality is the problem. One couple is derided for their collection of 1950s American kitsch, another for their profusion of fake flowers, still another for the shower in the master bathroom with a full-length window you can\u2019t block. When your home is a commodity, nothing unique or quirky is allowed. The winner of the entire competition is a \u201cZen\u201d retreat that looks as inoffensive as humanly possible. Yet the show\u2019s only appealing element is personality. It\u2019s fun to watch for Australianisms. The group goes to a rural pub, races cane toads, and spears mud crabs. It did not make me want to travel there.\n\nMaybe the issue is that these shows are too relevant, hovering on the border of entertainment and twenty-first-century economic survivalism. Years after its peak, Kondo-ing once again took over the Internet in the past week as viewers posted photos of their socks neatly aligned in drawers. I wondered if anything I owned truly sparked joy. Then again, if I suddenly couldn\u2019t afford my rent, I could just ditch everything with a whiff of personality, then install bunk beds, pendant lights, and an Instagram wall with a hashtag decal and let my apartment monetize itself, right?\n\nWhat these reality shows really point to is the need for rent control and tenants\u2019 rights, a world in which we don\u2019t have to repackage our homes in order to keep them. I propose outlawing private property and giving everyone 365 Airbnb credits a year instead.\n\nPerec\u2019s Jerome and Sylvie never find their way out of materialism either, despite abandoning Paris briefly for Tunisia. They return to France and find executive advertising jobs with salaries better suited to their tastes. \u201cThey will have their chesterfield settee,\u201d Perec writes. \u201cThey will have huge and empty rooms full of light; plenty of clearance, glass panels, magnificent outlook.\u201d Sounds nice, I\u2019d stay there."

    "text": "We are used to literary works responding to one another: Ulysses rewrites The Odyssey, Wide Sargasso Sea imagines a story adjacent to Jane Eyre. But these are published works speaking to other published works. Woolf\u2019s dialogue with other diarists is different. A diary is a private monologue by one writer, made public posthumously (in Pepys\u2019s case, centuries after it was written), and Woolf is responding in turn in her own private setting.\n\nNever, though, entirely private. Even from a young age, Woolf seems to know her diaries may someday be read by others: \u201cI have made the most heroic resolution to change my ideas of calligraphy in conformance with those of my family,\u201d she writes in 1899, recognizing even then that she wants her private thoughts to someday be read by others. She also reread her own diaries, a process Lounsberry charts throughout all three books, one that further enriches them as \u201cshe constantly rereads it with a critical and curious eye.\u201d\n\nTraditionally, Woolf\u2019s diaries have been divided in half. There are her mature diaries, comprised of the five volumes that were published between 1977 and 1984. These begin with 1915, the year her first book, The Voyage Out was published, as though to emphasize that they are the thoughts of a published writer, and not just some unknown young girl. Those earlier diaries eventually appeared, in a far more edited form, in 1990, in a volume titled Passionate Apprentice. Lounsberry rejects this split for a tripartite structure: Her first book focuses on her early, experimental diaries, through 1918; the second, the diaries of her high modernist years (through 1929); and the third, the diaries of her final decade, when she struggled with her final masterpieces The Years, Three Guineas and Between the Acts, while trying to ward off depression as the world collapsed with the march of fascism.\n\nLounsberry\u2019s first volume is perhaps the most interesting, when Woolf is most actively experimenting with what a diary is and can be. Woolf\u2019s first two novels, The Voyage Out and Night and Day, are both accomplished, but relatively unadventurous, formally speaking, opting for generic conventions of the nineteenth-century realist novel. It wouldn\u2019t be until 1922\u2019s Jacob\u2019s Room that she would begin radically experimenting with what the novel could be. But with her diaries, by contrast, she had already been radically experimenting for decades, trying out new forms, incorporating what she was learning from Pepys and Boswell and turning these lessons to new ends.\n\nThe middle years, the years of Woolf\u2019s greatest successes, when writing came fastest to her, correspond with her leanest diary years\u2014as long as she could effortlessly turn writing into paid work and novels, she had less need for a private well of secret thoughts. Her \u201cSpare, second diary stage\u201d is perhaps the least revealing of the three, for the simple reason that much of her best writing went into her 1920s masterpieces: Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, A Room of One\u2019s Own, and Orlando (along with A Common Reader and the flood of essays and other work from this period).\n\nBy the third volume, Woolf\u2019s creative process is running aground: The Waves, despite its brilliance, doesn\u2019t come easily, and the stubborn 1937 novel The Years nearly defeats her altogether. More and more, she turns to her diary to write free of the constraints that her public persona has foisted on her. (\u201cOh what a grind it is embodying all these ideas, she writes on March 18,1935, \u201c& having perpetually to expose my mind, opened & intensified as it is by the heat of creation to the blasts of the outer world.\u201d) In these years, Lounsberry suggests, a battle \u201cplays out across Woolf\u2019s diaries: her fierce fight for freedom.\u201d\n\nIn the late diaries, what\u2019s left out is as important as what\u2019s written down. Woolf\u2019s nephew Julian Bell left to fight in the Spanish Civil War on June 7, 1937; Woolf learned of his death on July 20. For the next two weeks, Woolf doesn\u2019t touch her diary; finally, 17 days after news of his death, she writes, \u201cWell but one must make a beginning. Its [sic] odd that I can hardly bring myself, with all my verbosity\u2014the expression mania which is inborn in me\u2014to say anything about Julian\u2019s death.\u201d If these private diaries once offered her a way to put her secret thoughts into words, by the late 1930s these thoughts are now beyond words. Increasingly, these lacunae define her late diaries, as the war and her own internal demons overtake her.\n\nLounsberry\u2019s books are methodical, at times plodding, working forward chronologically through each diary, interspersed with whatever diary Woolf was reading at the time. At times it feels more archival than anything else. Her target audience is primarily other Woolf scholars, of course, but there\u2019s something here for all fans of Woolf\u2019s diaries, as well as anyone interested in how a woman writer navigates the role of public and private writing. As modernist scholar Elizabeth Podnieks argues, \u201cmany women wrote their diaries by keeping up a pretense that they were private, while intending them to be published at a later date. In this way they could communicate to an audience thoughts and feelings that were too personal or controversial to be revealed through their fiction, but which they wanted, and needed, to convey.\u201d Woolf is an almost paradigmatic example of this, offering a variety of catty, quotidian, and sometimes mean-spirited selves that contradict the image formed by her carefully-sculpted works. Rather than treat the diaries solely as the behind-the-scenes key to the novels, these books instead chronicle the push and pull of her private and public writing, offering a fuller picture of Woolf\u2019s life.\n\nWith luck, they\u2019ll also spur a longer conversation about reevaluating Woolf\u2019s diaries. And perhaps\u2014U.S. and U.K. copyright laws notwithstanding\u2014we might see stand-alone editions in the future: the Asheham Natural History Diary, the Cornwall Diary of 1905, the sketchbook of 1903. Barbara Lounsberry has done for Woolf\u2019s diaries what the diaries once did for Woolf\u2019s novels, and what all great literary criticism seeks to do: It takes a canonical work of literature and offers an entirely new way of seeing it."

    "text": "\u201cBy any objective measure, the law has failed,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThirty states of emergency are in effect today\u2014several times more than when the act was passed. Most have been renewed for years on end. And during the 40 years the law has been in place, Congress has not met even once, let alone every six months, to vote on whether to end them.\u201d The Brennan Center tabulated 123 duly-passed laws that grant the executive branch sweeping new powers at the president\u2019s discretion, including the ability to lawfully commandeer telecommunications systems and declare martial law.\n\nThe lawmakers of an earlier age thus made an egregious oversight: They assumed that future presidents would use these extraordinary powers in good faith, to address genuine national emergencies. The Trump administration is a monument to their lack of foresight. In an unhappy syzygy, the areas where Congress has ceded the most power and the broadest discretion\u2014immigration and national security\u2014also happen to be Trump\u2019s favorite playgrounds for both policy and politics.\n\nTake the current state of the Temporary Protected Status system. Congress set it up in 1990 to give temporary legal status to foreign nonimmigrants in the United States if they are fleeing extraordinary hardship in their home country, such as civil war or a major natural disaster. Trump\u2019s predecessors used it to shield migrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and seven other countries from deportation. Trump used that discretion to decline to renew legal status for most of those groups. More than 200,000 people, some of whom who had spent more than two decades building lives in the U.S., are now at risk for deportation when their status expires over the next few years.\n\nThe administration has an uncanny knack for exploiting oft-overlooked provisions in American immigration law. Trump ad-libbed his first proposal for the Muslim travel ban on the campaign trail in December 2015, originally describing it as a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d No law authorizing such a ban would ever make it through Congress today. Nonetheless, he was able to implement a ban on several Muslim-majority countries by citing a provision in a 1952 federal immigration law that allows the president to \u201csuspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens\u201d for an indefinite period if he deems their entry to be \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nWhy did Congress give the president such sweeping powers? The State Department\u2019s Office of the Historian noted that two of the law\u2019s authors, Nevada Senator Pat McCarran and Pennsylvania Representative Francis Walter, had previously \u201cexpressed concerns that the United States could face communist infiltration through immigration and that unassimilated aliens could threaten the foundations of American life.\u201d The Supreme Court also typically gives its broadest level of deference to presidential power when it is invoked in the name of national security. Those precedents led the justices to narrowly uphold Trump\u2019s travel ban last June, effectively sanctifying the most bigoted presidential act in modern American history.\n\nCongress\u2019 past foolishness does not excuse Trump\u2019s current actions, but a declaration of emergency for political gain would not mark a terminal slide into authoritarian rule. It might even do some good by shining a spotlight on the mistakes and misjudgments of past Congresses\u2014and providing powerful evidence of the need for lawmakers to claw back the legal authority that was too freely granted to presidents over the past century."

    "text": "Republicans never truly reckoned with the midterms. Their defeat of several high-profile Democrats\u2014Beto O\u2019Rourke, Andrew Gillum, and Stacey Abrams\u2014and two-seat gain in the Senate allowed them to put a positive spin on the results. (Never mind that many of those candidates were long-shots, and that the Senate map was a nightmare for Democrats.) Also, more than a dozen House races weren\u2019t certified until weeks after the election, obscuring the extent of the GOP\u2019s losses. Much of the initial media coverage thus didn\u2019t declare what would later become apparent: This was every bit the \u201cblue wave\u201d that had been predicted.\n\n\n\nWhen Republican leaders finally were asked about the midterms, they made excuses. Paul Ryan, then retiring as House speaker, echoed Trump\u2019s conspiratorial language, blaming court-ordered redistricting in Pennsylvania and California\u2019s voting procedures. \u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s suburban voters. Pennsylvania redistricting and California just defies logic to me,\u201d Ryan told The Washington Post in November. \u201cThis election system they have [in California], I can\u2019t begin to understand it.\u201d Kevin McCarthy, now the House minority leader, told his caucus that \u201chistory was against\u201d the party, as if the defeat was fated\u2014and said he would continue to back the president.\n\n\n\nBut mostly, Republicans have put their heads in the sand, refusing to consider the implications of the midterm results or the role the president and his immigration policy played. \u201cThere has been close to no introspection in the G.O.P. conference and really no coming to grips with the shifting demographics that get to why we lost those seats,\u201d New York Republican Elise Stefanik told The New York Times. \u201cI\u2019m very frustrated and I know other members are frustrated.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat lack of introspection has once again pushed Republicans to back the president as he advances an unpopular immigration policy supported by only a third of Americans. To an extent, they are standing behind him out of fear. Given Trump\u2019s hounding of opponents within his own party\u2014senators Jeff Flake and Bob Corker both retired rather than run for reelection\u2014there is some concern that stepping out of line will attract the ire of the president and his allies in conservative media, ultimately resulting in their defeat to a pro-Trump challenger in their next primary election.\n\n\n\nBut it also points to a Republican leadership that is completely neutered. Two years ago, they made what could be seen as a calculated bet. They decided to defend the president, both from the Russia investigation and from his many self-inflicted wounds, in exchange for a shot at repealing Obamacare and passing a $1.5 trillion corporate tax cut. With Democrats now in control of the House\u2014and, again, with ample evidence that the president\u2019s immigration policies are not popular with a majority of voters\u2014they have little incentive to continue to stand behind the president as he prolongs his self-destructive government shutdown, especially now that 800,000 federal workers are missing a paycheck.\n\n"

    "text": "In his 2015 book The Republic of Conscience, former U.S. Senator and presidential candidate Gary Hart identifies what may be the central dynamic of American political and economic history: the struggle to accommodate the interests of a commonwealth with a capitalist economic system. \u201cThere has never been a serious effort to convert the United States to socialism or widespread public ownership,\u201d he points out. \u201cThere have been continuing efforts, even today, to convert much of our publicly owned resources to private ownership and development.\u201d\n\nAs Hart explains, we enjoy two different kinds of public resources\u2014natural resources, such as land, water, and wilderness; and built public infrastructure, such as transportation systems, recreation areas and facilities, and public schools. The question of which resources should be administered by public agencies on behalf of everyone and which should be subject to the private interests of corporations and shareholders is and will remain passionately contested in politics. Hart argues that the citizens of a commonwealth are obliged to preserve public resources not only for their own benefit but for the sake of future generations. \u201cThe charters of few if any private corporations include concern for the well-being of future generations,\u201d he comments, rather bitterly.\n\nHart observes elsewhere that the United States is heir to two distinct and venerable politico-philosophical traditions, that of liberalism and that of republicanism (which is often referred to nowadays as \u201ccivic republicanism,\u201d to avoid any confusion with the Republican Party). The central focus of the liberal tradition is on the rights of individual citizens to be free of interference by government in their private affairs. The republican tradition, on the other hand, concerns itself with the public arena, and the right\u2014which is also an obligation\u2014of citizens to participate fully in the political affairs of their community in determining its collective destiny. This republican version of freedom has been called \u201cpublic liberty.\u201d\n\nMany commentators have considered the two contrasting philosophies to be incommensurable\u2014so divergent in their essentials, in other words, as to resist being judged by the same standard. Thomas Jefferson accepted John Locke\u2019s thesis that people possessed the grand, overarching, natural rights to \u201clife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\u201d Hart writes, as well as more mundane ones such as the rights of speech, assembly, and worship, and to a jury trial by peers. But Jefferson added to that liberal stance the republican stipulation that such rights would never be secure without active citizen involvement in the governmental process."

    "text": "We are used to literary works responding to one another: Ulysses rewrites The Odyssey, Wide Sargasso Sea imagines a story adjacent to Jane Eyre. But these are published works speaking to other published works. Woolf\u2019s dialogue with other diarists is different. A diary is a private monologue by one writer, made public posthumously (in Pepys\u2019s case, centuries after it was written), and Woolf is responding in turn in her own private setting.\n\nNever, though, entirely private. Even from a young age, Woolf seems to know her diaries may someday be read by others: \u201cI have made the most heroic resolution to change my ideas of calligraphy in conformance with those of my family,\u201d she writes in 1899, recognizing even then that she wants her private thoughts to someday be read by others. She also reread her own diaries, a process Lounsberry charts throughout all three books, one that further enriches them as \u201cshe constantly rereads it with a critical and curious eye.\u201d\n\nTraditionally, Woolf\u2019s diaries have been divided in half. There are her mature diaries, comprised of the five volumes that were published between 1977 and 1984. These begin with 1915, the year her first book, The Voyage Out was published, as though to emphasize that they are the thoughts of a published writer, and not just some unknown young girl. Those earlier diaries eventually appeared, in a far more edited form, in 1990, in a volume titled Passionate Apprentice. Lounsberry rejects this split for a tripartite structure: Her first book focuses on her early, experimental diaries, through 1918; the second, the diaries of her high modernist years (through 1929); and the third, the diaries of her final decade, when she struggled with her final masterpieces The Years, Three Guineas and Between the Acts, while trying to ward off depression as the world collapsed with the march of fascism.\n\nLounsberry\u2019s first volume is perhaps the most interesting, when Woolf is most actively experimenting with what a diary is and can be. Woolf\u2019s first two novels, The Voyage Out and Night and Day, are both accomplished, but relatively unadventurous, formally speaking, opting for generic conventions of the nineteenth-century realist novel. It wouldn\u2019t be until 1922\u2019s Jacob\u2019s Room that she would begin radically experimenting with what the novel could be. But with her diaries, by contrast, she had already been radically experimenting for decades, trying out new forms, incorporating what she was learning from Pepys and Boswell and turning these lessons to new ends.\n\nThe middle years, the years of Woolf\u2019s greatest successes, when writing came fastest to her, correspond with her leanest diary years\u2014as long as she could effortlessly turn writing into paid work and novels, she had less need for a private well of secret thoughts. Her \u201cSpare, second diary stage\u201d is perhaps the least revealing of the three, for the simple reason that much of her best writing went into her 1920s masterpieces: Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, A Room of One\u2019s Own, and Orlando (along with A Common Reader and the flood of essays and other work from this period).\n\nBy the third volume, Woolf\u2019s creative process is running aground: The Waves, despite its brilliance, doesn\u2019t come easily, and the stubborn 1937 novel The Years nearly defeats her altogether. More and more, she turns to her diary to write free of the constraints that her public persona has foisted on her. (\u201cOh what a grind it is embodying all these ideas, she writes on March 18,1935, \u201c& having perpetually to expose my mind, opened & intensified as it is by the heat of creation to the blasts of the outer world.\u201d) In these years, Lounsberry suggests, a battle \u201cplays out across Woolf\u2019s diaries: her fierce fight for freedom.\u201d\n\nIn the late diaries, what\u2019s left out is as important as what\u2019s written down. Woolf\u2019s nephew Julian Bell left to fight in the Spanish Civil War on June 7, 1937; Woolf learned of his death on July 20. For the next two weeks, Woolf doesn\u2019t touch her diary; finally, 17 days after news of his death, she writes, \u201cWell but one must make a beginning. Its [sic] odd that I can hardly bring myself, with all my verbosity\u2014the expression mania which is inborn in me\u2014to say anything about Julian\u2019s death.\u201d If these private diaries once offered her a way to put her secret thoughts into words, by the late 1930s these thoughts are now beyond words. Increasingly, these lacunae define her late diaries, as the war and her own internal demons overtake her.\n\nLounsberry\u2019s books are methodical, at times plodding, working forward chronologically through each diary, interspersed with whatever diary Woolf was reading at the time. At times it feels more archival than anything else. Her target audience is primarily other Woolf scholars, of course, but there\u2019s something here for all fans of Woolf\u2019s diaries, as well as anyone interested in how a woman writer navigates the role of public and private writing. As modernist scholar Elizabeth Podnieks argues, \u201cmany women wrote their diaries by keeping up a pretense that they were private, while intending them to be published at a later date. In this way they could communicate to an audience thoughts and feelings that were too personal or controversial to be revealed through their fiction, but which they wanted, and needed, to convey.\u201d Woolf is an almost paradigmatic example of this, offering a variety of catty, quotidian, and sometimes mean-spirited selves that contradict the image formed by her carefully-sculpted works. Rather than treat the diaries solely as the behind-the-scenes key to the novels, these books instead chronicle the push and pull of her private and public writing, offering a fuller picture of Woolf\u2019s life.\n\nWith luck, they\u2019ll also spur a longer conversation about reevaluating Woolf\u2019s diaries. And perhaps\u2014U.S. and U.K. copyright laws notwithstanding\u2014we might see stand-alone editions in the future: the Asheham Natural History Diary, the Cornwall Diary of 1905, the sketchbook of 1903. Barbara Lounsberry has done for Woolf\u2019s diaries what the diaries once did for Woolf\u2019s novels, and what all great literary criticism seeks to do: It takes a canonical work of literature and offers an entirely new way of seeing it."

    ],
    "text": "First, it\u2019s increasingly clear that America has begun to move on from its turn-of-the-century fixation. This year marks the 40th anniversary of seismic events including the Iranian revolution and historic peace between Israel and Egypt. Such events, followed by the 1991 Gulf War and 9/11 attacks, drew America more deeply into the Middle East with an ever-increasing military footprint. The strategic rationale and public appetite for deep U.S. engagement were strong. But this has frayed during the past decade and a half of U.S. involvement in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yemen, and lack of progress on regional efforts\u2014from the Mideast peace to governance. Meanwhile, the United States has become consumed with its own animosities and political sectarianism. Fewer Americans see the value of staying engaged in the region. That\u2019s a reality that will affect any administration\u2019s Middle East policy, regardless of ideology.\n\nTrump purports to be asking the very question on voters\u2019 minds when it comes to Middle East involvement: \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for us?\u201d But he\u2019s proposing answers in the wrong places, trying to conjure a better value proposition by hyping semi-fictional arms deals, a dead-end pressure-for-its-own-sake Iran strategy, and a nonexistent Mideast peace plan. Even if he manages to claim significant tactical victories, none is likely to change the underlying equation that currently makes Middle East policy look like a losing game to many Americans: urgent problems at home, decades of disastrous and disappointing entanglements in the region, and a complicated set of realities about fossil fuels.\n\nIn theory, that sense of detachment could offer space for Middle East policy to be guided by a greater degree of respect for human dignity\u2014the second note Pompeo should strike this week. Part of the growing distaste in America for all things Middle East comes from recognizing the ugliness of the situation for many ordinary people in the region\u2014the murders and starvation of children in Syria and Yemen, widespread torture, and the scenes from an Israeli occupation with no end in sight and almost zero pushback from this administration. The horrific details of how Saudi officials lured journalist Jamal Khashoggi into their diplomatic compound and murdered him has symbolized a wider problem. While there\u2019s no instant U.S.-sourced cure for sectarian conflict, Israel-Palestine, and persistent human rights abuses, even a slightly more principled stance against human suffering constitutes low-hanging political fruit at this point: The last two years of increasing recklessness from Saudi Arabia and others suggests that the mere prospect that prior U.S. administrations might care has previously inspired a degree of restraint.\n\nPompeo and Trump have called out abuses inside Iran, for example, but shamefully pulled punches with our closest partners, particularly the Saudis. This blank check and the brutal impunity it has underwritten have become a political issue, alienating Washington and many Americans, as seen in the bipartisan support for legislation in Congress criticizing Saudi Arabia\u2019s actions. This has already done long-term damage to the bipartisan foundations of decades-old partnerships. Watching Arab authoritarians reciprocate by flattering Trump may give Americans a newfound appreciation for how Arab societies have felt watching outsiders cultivate the ruling family and military with little regard for the rest. Post-Trump, this dynamic is likely to reinforce longer-term trends pushing America further out of the Middle East.\n\nThe third point Pompeo would ideally include\u2014related to the second\u2014is that Iran and terrorism aren\u2019t the region\u2019s only long-term problems. While these issues top many bilateral agendas, nearly all of the countries of the region also continue to face crushing demographic, economic, and governance challenges. The problems pinpointed in successive United Nations Development Programme\u2019s Arab Human Development Reports\u2014poor governance, high unemployment, low quality education\u2014have grown worse, and few countries have taken tangible steps to shore up the social contract. A focus on zero-sum regional competition\u2014countering Iran and Islamists\u2014at the expense of conflict resolution and hard choices at home, has only deepened the regional stability deficits that matter most\u2014not to Americans, who right now are focused elsewhere, but to the region\u2019s own people."

    "text": "During the Pinochet regime, University of Chicago and Harvard-educated neoliberal economists propping up the dictatorship through spending cuts and privatization were known as \u201cChicago Boys.\u201d The day following the inauguration, Bolsonaro had his very own Chicago Boy sworn in as Economy Minister: Paulo Guedes, a Milton Friedman-influenced neoliberal who taught economics in Chile during the Pinochet era. Joaquim Levy, the new head of the Brazilian Development Bank, and Roberto Castello Branco, the new chief executive of the oil and natural gas company Petrobras, are also Chicago economics alumni. The Brazilian economy, long stagnant, definitely needs reforms. But, as of yet, Bolsonarans seem untroubled by the fact that neoliberal successes in Chile capitalized on the \u201cadvantages\u201d of authoritarian oppression\u2014bans on unions and strikes and the absence of a political opposition.\n\nThe precedent of military rule in Brazil makes him more dangerous than his United States counterpart.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s savvy appointment of popular corruption fighter Sergio Moro to lead an expanded Ministry of Justice continues an election persona that for many voters seemed to promise \u201ca deep change in the political establishment,\u201d as Rodrigo Craveiro, a journalist with Brazilian daily Correio Braziliense, wrote to me by email. Yet Bolsonaro would be the unusual authoritarian if he eradicated corruption; he\u2019ll more likely use the moral high ground of anti-corruption to neutralize his political enemies and purge the bureaucracy, the better to populate it with loyalists. Certainly, Bolsonaro has benefited from the corruption scandals that have rocked the traditional political class\u2014widely popular President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who might have defeated Bolsonaro had he not been barred from seeking election in 2018, is now serving a twelve-year jail sentence, while his successor, Dilma Rousseff, was impeached in 2016. Moro, the ex-judge who jailed da Silva, and who is crucial for this first phase, may find himself cast aside later.\n\nBolsonaro, a career politician, used his military background as a paratrooper to separate himself from the corrupt reputations of other career politicians, playing on the idea that the military is nonpartisan, since serving officers are forbidden from making political statements. One-third of his cabinet positions have gone to military officers; a retired general, Hamilton Mour\u00e3o, is his vice president. It seems the post-dictatorship wariness of having the military play an active role in politics has waned\u2014an increasing number of Brazilians want \u201claw and order\u201d government regardless of the consequences.\n\n\u201cBolsonaro is as much an apparition from Brazil\u2019s past as a harbinger of its future,\u201d historian Kenneth Serbin wrote at Foreign Affairs the day of the inauguration: Only a \u201cpolitics of forgetting\u201d about the violence of the military dictatorship has made his ascent possible. I\u2019d go further: Bolsonaro advances a new phase of remembrance that rehabilitates the people and causes of that terrible time. During the 2016 congressional proceedings leading to Rousseff\u2019s impeachment, Bolsonaro dedicated his vote against her to her torturer\u2014Colonel Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra, de facto chief of army intelligence services, which ordered Rousseff, then a leftist guerrilla, tortured for three weeks in 1970 (she was then a political prisoner for two years). Sympathizers like Bolsonaro publicly honor those who subjected Brazilians to torture methods such as \u201cthe barbecue,\u201d where victims were tied to a metal rack and given electric shocks on and inside their bodies.\n\nBolsonaro may be called the \u201cTrump of the Tropics\u201d for his impolitic and often incoherent remarks, his skill with social media, and hodge-podge coalition of Evangelical Christians, military toughs, and business elites. But the precedent of military rule in Brazil makes him more dangerous than his United States counterpart. In 1999, Bolsonaro declared that if he ever became president he\u2019d immediately launch a coup and declare himself dictator. Twenty years later, he\u2019s in power. Time will tell what kind of strongman he will be."

    "text": "Thanks to the results of last year\u2019s midterm elections, there are almost certainly enough votes in the House to impeach Trump\u2014and almost certainly not enough votes in the Republican-controlled Senate to convict him. Even if the entire Democratic caucus voted to convict Trump, twenty Republican senators would need to join them to oust him from office. That\u2019s an extraordinarily high barrier for Trump\u2019s opponents to overcome in a hyper-partisan climate. Support for impeachment may also wane overall as 2020 draws closer; lawmakers and the public may be uncomfortable with removing a president from office so close to an election, which could accomplish the same result but with greater political legitimacy.\n\nIn some ways, this is a familiar debate. Impeachment threats became a staple of American presidencies after the House impeached Bill Clinton in 1998. (He was subsequently acquitted by the Senate the following year.) Some Democrats in Congress, mostly on the party\u2019s left wing, filed articles of impeachment against George W. Bush related to the Iraq War, administration scandals, and other topics. A smaller number of Republicans proposed impeaching Barack Obama during his presidency. None of these efforts attracted mainstream support, however, and party leaders ultimately squelched them in the House before they went far.\n\nThis time is different. Trump is openly hostile to any constraints on his power. He castigates federal judges who rule against him so frequently and so vehemently that Chief Justice John Roberts publicly came to their defense last year. While Congress refuses to fund his border wall, he has threatened to declare a national emergency to secure the funds without congressional approval. Trump is also averse to basic democratic principles. When polls showed him trailing ahead of the 2016 presidential election, he spread false allegations that the election was rigged against him. During last year\u2019s midterms, he deployed the military within U.S. borders as a partisan campaign stunt.\n\nElections are typically the best means for removing presidents for bad policies or general incompetence. Impeachment is supposed to be reserved for serious abuses of power, or when the office-holder threatens the integrity of American democracy. There\u2019s a strong case to be made for impeaching Trump on those grounds. The New York Times\u2019 David Leonhardt laid out four specific reasons last week: for using the presidency to enrich himself and his businesses, for violating campaign-finance laws during the 2016 election, by obstructing justice during the Russia investigation, and by subverting the nation\u2019s democratic structures throughout his presidency.\n\nA serious challenge for any impeachment effort is the lack of precedent for it. There have been two presidential impeachment trials over the last 230 years, and neither ended in his removal from office. (Richard Nixon resigned before the House could impeach him after learning his conviction would be virtually certain in the Senate.) So while there are plenty of ways to show how impeachment can fail, there is none showing it can succeed. The Constitution itself offers little guidance: Presidents can be impeached for \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d which can mean whatever the House and Senate want it to mean."

    "text": "On January 1, Nicolle predicted \u201can armed national uprising.\u201d This too was nothing new; he\u2019s been saying as much since November 5. Then there are the litany of yellow vest leaders who, in appearance after appearance on television, personally dissociate themselves from violence, while wringing their hands that, if Macron doesn\u2019t accede to their demands and resign, tout \u00e7a va mal se terminer, or \u201ceverything will end badly.\u201d This weekend, the protesters again gave a glimpse of what that might mean, clashing with police and breaching a ministry building.\n\nTo be clear, there is no impending redux of the French Revolution. France has no tyranny to overthrow, no dictator or king to depose. It has the same grab-bag of problems that most of its Western European neighbors face. And while authoritarianism rises in Hungary and Poland, while Brexit is about to break Britain, while Donald Trump undermines every institution of American government, France has so far largely escaped the worst of populism and its discontents.\n\nBut there is a challenge to the left in particular, in the nature of the gilets jaunes, in the violence that has been an undeniable reason for their success, and in the undesirable voices that have come to the fore: How to balance empathy for economic hardship and a genuine desire for social justice with a rejection of the worst impulses of a movement that finds its shape in organized chaos? How to protest Macron\u2019s reformist centrism while also defending the pillars of liberal democracy and a tolerant society?\n\nUnfortunately, this is a challenge the main left-wing opposition has largely failed to meet, a balance it has refused to strike. Just as populists see \u201cthe people\u201d as something pure in the face of corrupt elites, so, too, do certain elites desire for there to be an essential purity in the idea of an uprising of the alienated masses\u2014the \u201cneutral, politically indifferent people who never join a party and hardly ever go to the polls,\u201d as Hannah Arendt once described them.\n\nFirst, the gilets jaunes have always been inseparable from far-right politics. Supporters of Marine Le Pen have the most favorable views of the yellow vests, and a hypothetical gilets jaunes party would sap significant support from Le Pen in the upcoming European parliamentary elections.\n\nBut while one might expect the far-right to flourish in the midst of fake news and diffuse anger, significant parts of the left have responded to the idea that Macron is an \u201cultra-neoliberal\u201d\u2014so much so that they have chosen to be a sidecar to the destabilizing agenda of the far-right. Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon\u2014leader of the far left La France Insoumise, or Insubmissive France\u2014expressed in a long Facebook post his \u201cfascination\u201d with \u00c9ric Drouet, saying of the gilets jaunes that \u201ctheir rising, their incredible aptitude for combat, bewilders those who look down at the people from on high.\u201d M\u00e9lenchon compared him to the historical Jean-Baptiste Drouet who recognized Louis XVI as he attempted to flee Paris, leading to the king\u2019s arrest in Varennes.\n\nIn a section of her On the Origins of Totalitarianism that deals with the elite\u2019s fascination for the mob, Arendt writes, \u201cThe members of the elite did not object at all to paying a price, the destruction of civilization, for the fun of seeing how those who had been excluded unjustly in the past forced their way into it.... The temporary alliance between the elite and the mob rested largely on this genuine delight with which the former watched the latter destroy respectability.\u201d\n\nAt the roundabouts there is camaraderie and comfort, conspiracy and chaos. Neither half of that equation can be ignored. But how sad that, like the far right, a chunk of the left has become fascinated by the mob, choosing to pull bricks out of the wall in the hopes of climbing the rubble to political gain."

    "text": "The Clinton campaign\u2019s overconfidence that the \u201cblue wall\u201d would hold has been justly criticized, given that just 80,000 voters across Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin cost her the election. But there\u2019s little evidence that the campaign\u2019s midwestern ground game, and specifically its decision not to campaign in Wisconsin, made the difference. Instead a general lack of electoral enthusiasm, Clinton\u2019s baggage (both overstated and deserved), and the Comey letter proved to be more decisive. Yes, Trump won a record share of the white-working class vote, but the same group of voters made up a quarter of Clinton\u2019s coalition.\n\nDespite the political class\u2019 fixation on economic anxiety, the authors of Identity Crisis found that it was an isolated, partisan phenomenon: Republicans earning more than $100,000 a year were more concerned about the economy than Democrats earning less than $20,000. Instead, cultural anxiety was more decisive. \u201cEconomic anxiety had been decreasing, not increasing, in the eight years before 2016 and any impact it had was muted or at least not particularly distinctive compared to earlier elections,\u201d John Sides, Michael Tesler, and Lynn Vavreck wrote. \u201cWhen economic anxiety was refracted through social identities, however, the combination was potent. The important sentiment was not \u2018I might lose my job\u2019 but, in essence, \u2018People in my group are losing jobs to that other group.\u2019 Instead of a pure economic anxiety, what mattered was \u2018racialized economics.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe argument for Biden is that his blue-collar bona fides and tough talk will win back these voters. \u201cIf you look at Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the labor folks who voted for Trump, they love him,\u201d former Delaware governor Jack Markell told the Times about Biden. \u201cHe has a connection with these people.\u201d But it\u2019s unclear how Biden\u2019s political approach will appeal to voters motivated by cultural anxiety and \u201cracialized economics.\u201d It\u2019s possible that the kind of economic platform that Biden is expected to pitch\u2014one that stops short of Bernie Sanders\u2019s democratic socialism, but nevertheless focuses directly on workers\u2014could be effective here. But there\u2019s nothing about Biden, outside of his identity as an old white man who reps Scranton, that suggests that he can be the only messenger who will be effective in making a dent in Trump\u2019s non-college-educated white base.\n\nFor one thing, as Slate\u2019s Ben Mathis-Lilley notes, \u201cin 2018, Democrats flipped eight House districts that Obama won in 2012 but that Trump won in 2016; of those districts, which are in Biden\u2019s ostensible wheelhouse, five were won by non-white male candidates.\u201d Senators in the Biden mode, like Missouri\u2019s Claire McCaskill and Indiana\u2019s Joe Donnelly\u2014both of whom Biden campaigned for\u2014got walloped. Midterm voting suggests that the blue wall is being rebuilt by a diverse array of candidates, some similar to Biden (like Pennsylvania\u2019s Conor Lamb) and some not (like Michigan\u2019s Rashida Tlaib). There are strong signs that Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin are poised to return to the Democratic fold in 2020, though Ohio, where Republicans expanded their hold on state government, may be lost for good.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Biden is very popular, leading the potential Democratic field by as many as 20 points. But there\u2019s reason to believe that his support is inflated. His significant advantage in name recognition will shrink as the primaries take shape, and the scrutiny of his record will intensify. By sitting out the 2016 primary, Biden\u2019s record largely remained unexamined, thereby preserving his image as an affable, everyman vice president. But there are plenty of blemishes, including his shameful role during the Anita Hill hearings and his role in passing the 1994 crime bill\u2014the virtues of which he continues to extol. He also hasn\u2019t proven to be an effective presidential candidate: His 1988 campaign was derailed by plagiarism accusations, and he dropped out of the 2008 race after getting just 4 percent in the Iowa caucuses."

    "text": "From London to Rome, the European Union over the past decade has served as a useful punching bag, wheeled out to unite domestic voters against a conveniently opaque and unglamorous bogeyman. The results have been as various as the politicians and voters involved: In the United Kingdom, a series of unforced political errors have resulted in the extended and economically damaging Brexit saga. In Greece, demonstrators have largely stuck to burning European leaders in effigy. In Italy, support for remaining in the European Union seems to be dwindling.\n\nIn 2015, when the right-wing Law and Justice Party won majority power in Poland, many international observers feared the Central European country would become the next hotbed of virulent anti-European politics. And indeed, Poland\u2019s leaders have perfected the art of Brussels-bashing. But almost four years on, the pace of Poland\u2019s rightward turn seems to have slowed. With the country\u2019s right-wing populists struggling, and a prodigal leader ready to return from Brussels, Polish EU-bashing may soon be on the wane.\n\nSince coming to power, Law and Justice has purged the military and civil service, levied fines on the free press, and even launched a hostile takeover of the country\u2019s judiciary, lowering its Supreme Court retirement age to pack benches with party loyalists. The state has pursued a warm relationship with Viktor Orb\u00e1n, whose autocratic rule of Hungary has dismayed European counterparts since his installation in 2010. The EU threatened to cut Poland\u2019s EU voting rights over the judicial decision, a hollow threat given that all 27 states must agree, and Orb\u00e1n would surely veto such a move.\n\nUnlike other countries, where experts have attributed right-wing lurches to the 2008 financial crash\u2014Hungary, Italy, and Britain being classic examples\u2014Poland emerged from the crisis comparatively unscathed. Even today its economy continues to grow at a rate of 4.6 percent, one of the highest in the EU. Yet loud criticism of Brussels and EU leadership persists."

    "text": "House Democrats had big plans for opening the 116th Congress, with showy votes on cracking down on government corruption and protecting pre-existing conditions. But such plans rarely survive contact with reality. The party\u2019s takeover of the House on Thursday coincides with Day 13 of a partial government shutdown of nine cabinet-level departments, a crisis that takes precedence over every other legislative priority.\n\nNancy Pelosi, the presumptive House speaker, has outlined a two-bill package to fund the government, which will get a vote on Thursday. It\u2019s not likely to end the impasse, but it does signal an intention to make good on promises to the 800,000 or so federal workers who haven\u2019t received a paycheck since the shutdown. Section 2 of the second bill states that \u201cemployees furloughed as a result of the lapse in appropriations \u2026 shall be compensated at their standard rate of compensation\u201d for the time that they\u2019ve missed.\n\nBut only federal employees would be covered by this back-pay clause. That excludes everyone who toils for a federal contractor, particularly the low-wage workers who clean, secure, and staff federal buildings\u2014around 2,000 of them, according to the Service Employees International Union. When the Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo closed on Wednesday, contract workers who provide concessions and take tickets also got sent home, adding to the ranks.\n\nContractors are the most vulnerable people in the federal workforce, the ones who can least afford a disruption in their pay. And yet, in the aftermath of government shutdowns, they are the only employees who don\u2019t get compensated after the fact. In 2013, when the government closed for 16 days, federal workers received back pay, but low-wage contractors did not, causing serious financial depression for struggling families in Washington. \u201cWhen the politicians closed the government, they didn\u2019t think about the impact it would have on our families,\u201d Pablo Lazaro, a cook at a Smithsonian museum, said at the time."

      "John Fabian Witt"
    ],
    "text": "In some respects, at least, Marshall\u2019s views fit easily in late-eighteenth-century white Virginia. While he never owned nearly as many slaves as his cousin and rival Thomas Jefferson, Marshall was nonetheless deeply and inextricably enmeshed in a slave society. When he married in 1783, his new father-in-law gave him three horses and one enslaved person, a young woman named Robin. In later years, some 130 slaves tended Marshall\u2019s fields, growing tobacco and other crops. Another twelve or so worked in his home in Richmond.\n\nIn other respects, however, Marshall\u2019s ideas about the proper organization of American society were increasingly at odds with the views of Virginia voters. In the 1790s, his neighbors tended to follow the Democratic-Republican Party of Thomas Jefferson. Marshall, however, remained a dedicated Federalist. He supported the creation of a national bank and strong national powers more generally. He favored manufacturing, the assumption of state debts, and neutrality or even a pro-British stance in the wars of the French Revolution. White Virginians mostly resisted such policies. The state had already paid down its debt from the Revolution. A powerful federal government threatened to saddle Virginia with new taxes that would pay other states\u2019 debts. Manufacturing held little interest in the South. And the British navy promised to obstruct the trade on which the South\u2019s agricultural economy depended.\n\nIn 1799, when Washington persuaded Marshall to run for Congress, Marshall\u2019s local reputation and his neighbors\u2019 personal respect for him propelled him to victory, despite Virginia\u2019s increasing opposition to the Federalist platform. Marshall nevertheless aligned himself more and more closely with President John Adams. In the spring of 1800, Adams appointed Marshall as his new secretary of state, hoping that naming the Virginian would improve the declining political fortunes of Federalists in the South. But Marshall was not enough; that fall, political calamity struck for Federalists around the country. The party of Jefferson swept the Electoral College and the Congress.\n\nWith Jefferson set to take office in March 1801, Secretary of State Marshall used the intervening months to craft a blueprint for the Federalist Party in exile. Marshall\u2019s strategy rested on remaking the judiciary as the last holdout of Federalist power. When in late 1800 then-Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth fell ill and resigned, Adams nominated Marshall to be chief justice. A lame-duck Federalist Senate quickly confirmed him even as he remained secretary of state. The Congress hurriedly passed the Judiciary Act of 1801, too, which President Adams signed, creating 16 circuit court judgeships for Federalist appointees and substantially increasing the authority of the lower federal courts. A further piece of legislation authorized Adams to appoint 42 new justices of the peace for the District of Columbia. All 42 were Federalists.\n\nThe Court that Marshall inherited in early 1801 was a weak and untested institution. It consisted of six men. In its twelve years of existence, it had been a revolving door. The Senate had confirmed 16 justices during that time, three of whom had declined to serve. Others (including Alexander Hamilton) had re\u00adfused to be considered for the court at all.\n\nThe court that Marshall inherited in early 1801 was a weak and untested institution. In its twelve years of existence, it had been a revolving door.\n\nThe court\u2019s docket inspired no greater confidence. When the court convened for the first time in 1790, it had no cases to hear and only two justices in attendance. There were no cases at the next term of the court later that year, either. In February 1791, the court seemed to have found its first case. But the parties settled before submitting their arguments. When at last a case reached the court later that year, the justices concluded that they lacked jurisdiction to hear it. By the end of the August 1800 term, after a decade in existence, the court had heard arguments or ruled on a mere 86 cases. Its most important decision, upholding a suit against the state of Georgia, had been almost instantly reversed by the Eleventh Amendment, which barred federal courts from hearing lawsuits against states.\n\nThe court was virtually homeless, too. Congress lent the court a tiny ground-floor room in the unfinished Capitol. The room had no bench, only individual desks for the six justices, set on a raised platform. The Architect of the Capitol, Benjamin Latrobe, described it as \u201ca half-finished committee room meanly furnished, and very inconvenient.\u201d The court would nevertheless sit there for the next seven years. There was no library, no office space, and no staff. There was not even an official publisher of the court\u2019s opinions. The first publisher, a lawyer named Alexander Dallas, had declined to leave his home in Philadelphia to follow the court to the swamps of Washington, D.C.\n\nMaking matters still worse, it was not yet clear to many Americans what exactly the au\u00adthority of the new Constitution was. The unwritten English constitution, which was in some respects a model for its new American cousin, did not bind the Parliament. Neither did the post-Revolutionary state constitutions offer much clarity. Most were drafted by state legislatures, rather than by conventions of the people. Their provisions, like ordinary statutes enacted by the Parliament or by a legislature, were often amendable by the simple acts of subsequent Parliaments or legislatures. As Jefferson said about the Virginia state Constitution in 1781, the \u201cordinary legislature may alter the constitution itself.\u201d The argument was abstract but the stakes were considerable. If Congress could alter the federal Constitution at will, and if new legislation altered the basic terms of the constitutional arrangement, then there would be little the Supreme Court could do to guard the republic from Congress\u2019s authority.\n\nUpon taking over the government in 1801, Jefferson\u2019s loyalists set out to undermine Marshall\u2019s plan for continued Federalist influence by further weakening the federal judiciary. Jefferson himself promised to begin by \u201clopping off\u201d the new federal judicial officers. When the Seventh Congress convened for its first session in December, the new Democratic-Republican majority repealed the Judiciary Act of 1801 and canned the judges Adams had appointed to fill the new circuit judgeships. Congress brazenly abolished the court\u2019s 1802 term so that Marshall would not have a chance to rule on the legality of the Republicans\u2019 partisan maneuvering.\n\nOne move in particular drew attention. In the hectic last days of the Adams administration, Secretary of State Marshall had not managed to deliver all of the commissions for Adams\u2019s last-minute Federalist justices of the peace. James Madison, Jefferson\u2019s new secretary of state, found the duly executed commissions in his predecessor\u2019s office and refused to deliver them. One of them was made out to William Marbury, a prominent Washington, D.C., member of the Federalist Party. In the fight over the Federalist Party\u2019s efforts to pack the courts, Marbury\u2019s commission in itself was not especially important. But it offered Marshall an opportunity, which the new chief justice seized to chart a course for the Federalist-dominated court through the new political landscape of Jeffersonian America.\n\nMarbury sued Secretary of State James Madison in the Supreme Court to compel delivery of his commission. Madison and the administration declined to dignify Marbury\u2019s suit with a response. In any event, the suit made little headway, given that Congress had abolished the court\u2019s 1802 term. When the case was finally argued in February 1803, Madison did not even appear, either through counsel or in person, effectively rejecting the court\u2019s power to decide the case. The court, meanwhile, was not operating at full capacity. Two of the six justices missed the argument because of sickness. A third justice was rendered immobile by a bad attack of gout, forcing Marshall to read the opinion deciding the case from the living room of the justices\u2019 boardinghouse.\n\nDespite the inauspicious setting, or perhaps because of it, Marshall\u2019s famous decision in Marbury v. Madison was a bravura performance. Brookhiser\u2019s account captures much of the chief justice\u2019s high-wire act. In a court barely hanging on to institutional credibility, Marshall walked his audience through the logic of his decision. Marbury had a right to his office because there existed a valid commission made out to him and all but delivered. When there is a right, Marshall continued, there is of course a remedy. (William Black\u00adstone, whose book Commentaries on the Laws of England was the bible for lawyers of Marshall\u2019s generation, wrote that \u201cevery right \u2026 must have a remedy, and every injury its proper redress.\u201d)\n\nAt this stage of the opinion, Marshall seemed on his way to delivering a victory to his partisan ally William Marbury. But Marshall was a step ahead in a bigger game. What would happen if he ordered the secretary of state to deliver the commission? James Madison, with Jefferson\u2019s support, would likely ignore such an order. The court had no way to back up its word. Its essential weakness would be revealed. Marshall thus needed a way to rule in favor of the Jefferson administration while saving face: a way out of a bad spot without saying as much. And so, having answered the case\u2019s first two questions in Marbury\u2019s favor, Marshall asked a third: Was the Supreme Court the right forum for Marbury to seek his remedy? And Marshall\u2019s answer here was no.\n\nCongress, Marshall said, had pur\u00adported in the 1789 Judiciary Act to give the Supreme Court the power to issue orders to officers like Madison in suits like those brought by Marbury. The Constitution, however, defined the Supreme Court\u2019s authority in such suits more narrowly. The case thus seemed to call on Marshall to decide whether a statute at odds with the Constitution was valid. \u201cEither the law would have to be overruled,\u201d Brookhiser writes, \u201cor the Constitution ignored.\u201d Here, then, was the big question that had been mooted since at least 1776. What was the status of a written constitution in the new republic? Jefferson had insisted that legislatures could alter constitutions themselves, perhaps even by ordinary legislative acts. Marshall, by contrast, had insisted at the Virginia ratifying convention that courts were the guardians of constitutions. And now this position offered the chief justice a way out of a hard spot. By ruling that the courts were empowered to strike down statutes contravening the Constitution, Marshall produced a win for the Jefferson administration that was also a win for the courts. It was a brilliant coup.\n\nYet Brookhiser\u2019s version of the case misses the key step, one that reveals the full extent of Marshall\u2019s political project in the crisis. The Judiciary Act of 1789, properly read, had not actually purported to extend to the Supreme Court the power to issue orders to officers like Madison in suits like Marbury\u2019s. By its terms, the Judiciary Act only authorized orders \u201cin cases warranted by the principles and usages of law.\u201d If the order\n\nin question lay outside the powers afforded to the court by the Constitution, then the order was surely not \u201cwarranted by the principles and usages of law.\u201d Marshall\u2019s reading of the statute was thus unnecessary and arguably even tendentious. He had invented a conflict between the statute and the Constitution. He was confident that Jefferson and Madison would be satisfied with winning the battle over the commission. And so he took the occasion to submit a bid in the war over judicial power, confident that his partisan adversaries would overlook the sleight of hand. Privately, Jefferson fulminated. But Marshall was right.\n\nThe chief justice had managed a brilliant political maneuver in a case at the center of the great partisan firestorm of the age. And Marshall had explicitly based his opinion in Marbury on a claim that law was separate from politics. The chief justice\u2019s political strategy turned on a denial that he was engaged in politics at all. In doing so, he established a tradition for legitimating judicial review of congressional action, one that lay (as Justice Robert H. Jackson would later put it, in a different context) like a loaded weapon in the Constitution. The court would not use it again until decades later, when it struck down federal statutes in two pro-slavery cases, an 1842 slavecatcher decision in Prigg v. Pennsylvania and the infamous 1857 decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford.\n\nHaving escaped the political peril of 1803, Marshall spent the next 30 years defending Federalist Party ideas as chief justice in the republic of Jefferson and then Jackson. In Fletcher v. Peck in 1810, he inaugurated a line of cases enforcing the Contracts Clause of the Constitution against state efforts to alter contractual obligations. The fact that the contract in question was a land sale by a corrupt state legislature for the benefit of insiders did not move Marshall from his commitment to the enforcement of deals. Nine years later, in Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward, the chief justice enforced the Contracts Clause again to prohibit alteration of a state corporate charter. Marshall\u2019s agenda, Brookhiser says, was to insist on the sanctity of contracts. Meanwhile, the nationalist in Marshall used the Fletcher and Dartmouth College cases to assert the authority of the federal Constitution over the actions of state governments.\n\nPromoting the power of the federal government, Marshall committed the court to a position in the three-decades-old debate over a national bank. When the state of Maryland (like several other states) tried to tax in-state branches of the Second Bank of the United States, Marshall revisited arguments for a powerful central government that he had made in the Virginia ratifying convention in 1788. Echoing Alexander Hamilton\u2019s 1791 defense of the power of the Congress to establish a national bank, Marshall\u2019s opinion in McCulloch v. Maryland, decided in 1819, voiced as broad a conception of federal power as anyone has in two centuries since. On top of that, he construed the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution\u2019s Article VI (\u201cThe Laws of the United States \u2026 shall be the supreme Law of the Land\u201d) to prohibit state taxation of the Congress\u2019s creations.\n\nMarshall\u2019s court also established its authority over the states\u2019 supreme courts. And Marshall inaugurated the long tradition of a broad federal power under the Constitution\u2019s Commerce Clause. In Gibbons v. Ogden, decided in 1824, he undid a mono\u00adpoly charter granted to Robert Fulton and Robert Livingston by the state of New York for steamboat passage on the Hudson River, reasoning that the Congress\u2019s grant of a coastal license to other steam vessels represented a valid exercise of the federal commerce power. Today the same Commerce Clause power authorizes much of the administrative state, ranging from food and drug regulations, to antitrust law, to the law of employment discrimination, and much more.\n\nAs Marshall aged, his ability to impose Federalist policies waned. In 1827, he wrote his lone dissent on a constitutional matter in 34 years on the bench, disagreeing with the court\u2019s decision upholding a state bankruptcy law in Ogden v. Saunders.\n\nAmerica\u2019s evolving policies toward Native Americans also revealed the limits of Marshall\u2019s authority in the later years of his term. When efforts to drive the Cherokee out of Georgia and across the Mississippi River came to the court, Marshall ruled against state statutes that aimed to make life east of the Mississippi miserable for Native Americans. This time, in Worcester v. Georgia, he commanded a majority of the court, striking down a Georgia law that interfered with Cherokee authority to govern native lands. President Andrew Jackson probably never said \u201cJohn Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!\u201d despite journalists\u2019 apocryphal claims to the contrary. But he predicted that Marshall\u2019s opinion would fall \u201cstillborn\u201d in 1830s America. And for the most part he was right. White supporters of Jackson would push the Cherokee out of Georgia within a few years.\n\nSix years after his Ogden dissent, Marshall issued an opinion in the case of Barron v. Baltimore holding that the Bill of Rights\u2019 individual rights protections did not bind state governments. In freeing states from the national standards in the Bill of Rights, the case signaled the coming of a new era in which Federalist ideas about the strength of the federal government would have less sway in American politics. In 1835, two years after Barron v. Baltimore, Marshall died. The charter of the Second Bank of the United States soon expired. And in 1837, Marshall\u2019s successor, Roger Taney, would replace Marshall\u2019s strict insistence on the enforcement of contracts with a new and more populist program. Overturning a state-chartered bridge\u2019s monopoly over passage across the Charles River, Chief Justice Taney deprecated Marshall\u2019s beloved \u201crights of private property.\u201d \u201cWe must not forget,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat the community also have rights.\u201d\n\nBrookhiser contends that as a judge, Marshall aimed to translate the insights of the framers into the constitutional law of the republic. Marshall wrote that the \u201cgreat duty of a judge who construes an instrument is to find the intention of its makers.\u201d In Barron v. Baltimore, Brookhiser observes, Marshall attended to what he called the \u201cuniversal\u201d understanding of the Bill of Rights at the time of its enactment: It was meant to protect individuals, Marshall explained, against the actions of the federal government, not those of the state governments. Brookhiser concludes that the lesson for interpreting the Constitution is clear: Marshall understood that the Constitution ought to be read (in Brookhiser\u2019s words) \u201cas it was written and as it was meant.\u201d\n\nMarshall did not serve as a conduit for a founding era consensus, because there was no such consensus to channel.\n\nOf course, \u201cas written\u201d and \u201cas meant\u201d are two different things. But even setting this problem aside, Marshall\u2019s record as chief justice suggests that he was under no illusion that constitutional law was about recovering the pristine virtue of the framers. Marshall did not serve as a conduit for a founding era consensus, because there was no such consensus to channel. The men who gathered in Philadelphia in 1787 broke into factions almost immediately after the ratification of the Constitution precisely because they had not resolved many of the most controversial questions of the day. Marshall took sides in continuing bitter controversies because there was no way to avoid doing so. He could hardly rely on either the original intent or the original meaning of the document to resolve those controversies, for he knew that there had been no more consensus on hard questions like the bank in 1787 than there was in 1819. Unsurprisingly, then, Marshall\u2019s opinions relied not only on his own memory of the views of the Constitution\u2019s framers, but also on the text and the purpose of the document and on background principles of the law. General ideas of sound policy, at least from the Federalist perspective, provided a guiding light for Marshall and his court.\n\nIn this, Brookhiser\u2019s narrative shares the great short\u00adcoming of a very common misreading of Chief Justice Marshall. It minimizes the politics at the heart of Marshall\u2019s project. Brookhiser\u2019s updated version of the conventional story presents Marshall as the Atlas of American law, hoisting the Constitution upon his broad apolitical shoulders. Understating the politics of the court\u2019s founding years, however, is misleading. The idealized conception of Marshall\u2019s years on the court underpins Brookhiser\u2019s brusque dismissal of Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s controversial and ultimately successful court-packing proposal in 1937. Brookhiser castigates Roosevelt\u2019s plan to increase the size of the court as a \u201cRube Goldberg\u201d remedy for decisions with which the president disagreed. But Roosevelt and Marshall stand together, not apart, as Brookhiser would have it. Both men were statesmen who powerfully shaped the political trajectory of American constitutional law.\n\nRoosevelt was not the only president who considered remaking the court. Marshall\u2019s adversary Jefferson added a seventh justice in 1807. Martin Van Buren carried forward the agenda of his political ally Andrew Jackson and signed legislation adding two more justices shortly after Marshall\u2019s death. Abraham Lincoln signed a bill adding a tenth justice to the court at a crucial moment in 1863. Each of these presidents understood what Roosevelt and Marshall knew implicitly: The successes and failures of the court have turned on acts of statesmanship that are embedded in politics, not apart from politics.\n\nMarshall\u2019s ability to carry out the Federalist agenda for a generation after the party\u2019s decisive defeat at the polls stands as a warning for what we may expect to see in our own time. Accounts of his life that downplay his politics make it harder to grasp this key point. Worse, the conventional story of Marshall encourages a dangerous cycle of thinking about American law. Unfounded hopes for the court\u2019s ostensibly apolitical ideals produce undue disillusionment with the court\u2019s political realities. The truth is that law is not independent of party. It never has been. Law is not reducible to party, either. But now more than ever we need a realistic account of how our courts work, one that can recognize the law\u2019s long-standing and durable interconnections with the world of the partisan operative.\n\n"

The work is a response to a Newsweek essay that argued torture is sometimes \u201cmorally mandatory.\u201d Over the course of an hour, we see disembodied hands paging through newspaper articles and magazines; they\u2019re punctuated by typewritten key phrases (\u201clives of the innocents\u201d) and accompanied by jagged bursts of music and voices detailing stories of torture in Latin America. The video is dense, self-reflexive, and makes little appeal to viewers\u2019 emotions. It seems designed to overwhelm us with a barrage of information and push us toward a state of enlightened alienation.\n\nThis rigorous, almost dissertation-like approach is another hallmark of Rosler\u2019s practice. But Irrespective also highlights a less familiar and more straightforward method she has used to reach audiences. Her photography series directly present Rosler\u2019s own point of view, in a departure from her use of found images. One gallery groups Ventures Underground (c. 1980\u2013ongoing), In the Place of the Public: Airport Series (1983\u2013ongoing), Rights of Passage (1993\u201398), and Greenpoint Project (2011). These are intimate pictures shot while riding subways around the world; photographs of gleaming airport interiors; panoramic images of lifeless highways and bridges taken while driving; and pictures and short passages about local businesses in her neighborhood. Many of these works feel diaristic, like private glimpses into the life of an artist who has tended to look outward, rather than in on herself. There are no added layers of mediation, with the exception of the evocative words and phrases (\u201ctrace odors of stress and hustle\u201d) that fill the gallery wall to complete In the Place of the Public.\n\nAll of this may be why the photographs feel more like process notes than finished products. Yet the series\u2014especially the three about travel\u2014are consistent, in their own way, with Rosler\u2019s project. She interrupts the flow of everyday life to reframe it with a critical eye\u2014to make us pause and consider the spaces we pass through routinely. Staring at stone-faced passengers boxed into metal subway cars and at concrete stretches of highway, she prompts the viewer to think about the harshness of the built environment. When such alienating spaces connect our cities, is it any wonder that many of us struggle to link ourselves personally and politically to others?\n\nIrrespective is an excellent introduction to Rosler\u2019s oeuvre, establishing some of her core concerns. Its weakness is that it\u2019s a relatively small, object-focused show, whereas some of her most exciting and instructive art has been collaborative, public, and even ephemeral. Perhaps most notably, there are the garage sales she held between 1973 and 2012. In each case, she arranged a hodgepodge of secondhand items\u2014underwear, chairs, animal figurines, even bad paintings\u2014and offered them to the public at arbitrary prices. Part-installation, part-\u00adperformance, the sales commented cleverly on the complicated ways we determine value, bringing items typically thought of as disposable or cheap into art spaces, where objects are expensive and reign supreme.\n\nRosler has also made powerful interactive work about housing. In 1989, she organized a landmark series of three exhibitions at the Dia Art Foundation under the title If You Lived Here\u2026 Each focused on a different aspect of the housing crisis in New York City, and all included work not only from artists but also from community groups and homeless people. She also held four town hall meetings. The project ignored established hierarchies, as Rosler brought art and artists into dialogue with the wider community, in part to point out their role in the process of displacement: Artists moving into a neighborhood often heralds the beginning of rent increases that squeeze current residents. At the same time, she gave the community access to the resources of the art world.\n\nIt\u2019s disappointing that these and Rosler\u2019s other socially engaged works are not represented in the galleries at the Jewish Museum, only in the Irrespective catalog. These projects are the most radical manifestation of her approach to political art making. They shift the relationship of artist to audience so that it\u2019s less top-down: Rather than making a video to tell viewers everything she thinks they should know about the housing crisis in New York City, she creates a space where they can go, learn, and ask questions. Rosler becomes an informed facilitator rather than the sole authority.\n\nAfter all, if the final gallery at the Jewish Museum urges anything, it\u2019s not to trust those with grand claims to authority. The room features two works about President Donald Trump: a digitally distorted compilation of footage from the White House and a print of Trump, overlaid with two sets of text\u2014a comment he made about being able to shoot someone and not lose voters, and the names of people of color who have been killed by the police. The Trump works are the weakest in the show; Rosler hasn\u2019t figured out how to tell us something we don\u2019t know yet. But they share space with two other projects, both about books, and this sets up a clear conceptual battle between the pursuit of truth and a disregard for it.\n\nOne of those is Off the Shelf (2008, 2018), a series of digital photomontages of books from Rosler\u2019s library. The volumes are grouped thematically under such titles as \u201cUtopian Science Fiction, F\u201d or \u201cWar and Empire\u201d and seem to float within gradient-colored spaces, untethered from any physical \u00adreality. The series represents an ideal of the pure transmission of knowledge\u2014one that Rosler attempted to manifest between 2005 and 2009 by actually turning her library into a traveling installation that viewers could browse.\n\nThe other is Reading Hannah Arendt (Politically, for an Artist in the 21st Century) (2006), which occupies the center of the gallery. Fourteen clear mylar panels hang from the ceiling, each one containing a passage, in German and in English translation, from the political philosopher\u2019s 1951 book The Origins of Totalitarianism. The work is simple but effective: The panels are hung at odd angles so that viewers may walk between them, immersing themselves in words that feel weighted with moral and emotional clarity. \u201cIntellectual, spiritual, and artistic initiative is as dangerous to totalitarianism as the gangster initiative of the mob, and both are more dangerous than mere political opposition,\u201d it reads, and here we are, face to face with that reality. The work points us back to what Rosler has been telling us all along: Look again, closely, at what you think you know, and don\u2019t doubt the importance of what you find.\n\n"

    "text": "You\u2019re The Worst premiered on FX in 2014, a year that saw plenty of television shows about anxious urbanites who spilled fast-paced dialogue about their own emotional complexities. Jill Soloway\u2019s Transparent gave us a family drama about a transgender woman and her aimless, self-centered adult children in moneyed Los Angeles. Silicon Valley poked fun at San Francisco\u2019s start-up culture, and Broad City followed two best friends in New York City, as they faced gross smells on the subway and the humiliations of working at an exclusive gym. These strains carried over into the animal kingdom, where Bojack Horseman, then just beginning to stream on Netflix, examined the depressive episodes and cocaine binges of a cartoon horse who\u2019d once been a Hollywood star. For all these shows\u2019 different strengths, one theme ran through them: Being young was hard, and being privileged was harder.\n\nThe comedy in these shows came not from the (mostly white) characters bumping up against class boundaries or workplace rivals\u2014the entire basis for the jokes on Cheers, or Roseanne, or even The Office\u2014but from having to confront their own behavioral issues. Each character was their own worst enemy, lost and insensitive to the needs of anyone else. In other words, many 2014 shows descended directly from Seinfeld. And nowhere was the essential Seinfeldian DNA\u2014selfish people doing bad things and never learning from it\u2014more apparent, and also more compelling, than in You\u2019re the Worst.\n\nBefore Stephen Falk created You\u2019re the Worst, he was a producer on Orange Is the New Black and Weeds, two shows from Jenji Kohan, who is a master of cutting dialogue and splitting her protagonists open to expose grisly insides. Falk shares this merciless approach to character development; he wanted to put real people on television, acknowledging that real people are sometimes terrible. While Seinfeld\u2019s foursome display outsize, cartoonish traits (was anyone ever really as obtuse as George or as scattered as Kramer?), the four leads of You\u2019re the Worst are almost too accurate, their flaws too particular and dismayingly believable. If the characters on Seinfeld were oblivious to their flaws, the characters on You\u2019re the Worst fully know their shortcomings and try desperately to overcome them, though more often than not they fail. There is an equal share of empathy and nihilism in this. We are all sinners, but some of us can never improve.\n\nThe character of Jimmy\u2014a preening, vainglorious novelist who had a critically lauded debut\u2014is familiar to anyone who has met a self-important, minorly successful writer. He is a snob, who feels that the group\u2019s rituals\u2014Sunday Funday, for example\u2014are beneath him, and he complains about them at first. Lindsay, who begins the series stuck in an unhappy marriage, is a very specific brand of nasty and naughty, a woman who has turned misanthropic and petty in the face of her own limitations (Donohue plays Lindsay\u2019s sneering ditziness so brilliantly that I am surprised she hasn\u2019t won an Emmy for it). Edgar, a veteran with severe ptsd, is the most sym\u00adpathetic of the gang, but he sabotages his own happiness at every opportunity. He is both a pushover and a passive-aggressive mooch. For a long time, he refuses to get help or take steps to move forward (and out of Jimmy\u2019s spare room).\n\nAnd then there is Gretchen. Aya Cash, who spent much of her early career as a stage actress, has created a complex and devastating character\u2014one of the best representations of a clinical depressive ever translated to the screen. Over the course of five seasons, Gretchen has been suicidal, adulterous, catatonic, manic, and mean. But when she is not these things, she is goofy, generous, diligent (she is the publicist for a trio of cerebral rappers who provide much of the show\u2019s comic relief), and capable of love. She\u2019s tough but also an easy weeper. She\u2019s extremely high-functioning, except for when she isn\u2019t, and spends weeks at a time under a comforter."

    "text": "House Democrats had big plans for opening the 116th Congress, with showy votes on cracking down on government corruption and protecting pre-existing conditions. But such plans rarely survive contact with reality. The party\u2019s takeover of the House on Thursday coincides with Day 13 of a partial government shutdown of nine cabinet-level departments, a crisis that takes precedence over every other legislative priority.\n\nNancy Pelosi, the presumptive House speaker, has outlined a two-bill package to fund the government, which will get a vote on Thursday. It\u2019s not likely to end the impasse, but it does signal an intention to make good on promises to the 800,000 or so federal workers who haven\u2019t received a paycheck since the shutdown. Section 2 of the second bill states that \u201cemployees furloughed as a result of the lapse in appropriations \u2026 shall be compensated at their standard rate of compensation\u201d for the time that they\u2019ve missed.\n\nBut only federal employees would be covered by this back-pay clause. That excludes everyone who toils for a federal contractor, particularly the low-wage workers who clean, secure, and staff federal buildings\u2014around 2,000 of them, according to the Service Employees International Union. When the Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo closed on Wednesday, contract workers who provide concessions and take tickets also got sent home, adding to the ranks.\n\nContractors are the most vulnerable people in the federal workforce, the ones who can least afford a disruption in their pay. And yet, in the aftermath of government shutdowns, they are the only employees who don\u2019t get compensated after the fact. In 2013, when the government closed for 16 days, federal workers received back pay, but low-wage contractors did not, causing serious financial depression for struggling families in Washington. \u201cWhen the politicians closed the government, they didn\u2019t think about the impact it would have on our families,\u201d Pablo Lazaro, a cook at a Smithsonian museum, said at the time."

    "text": "At lot has changed since the 2016 election, when global warming barely featured in the televised debates. Last year brought record-breaking extreme weather that caused billions of dollars worth of damage across the country and world, and scientists sounded more alarmed than ever. The most frightening report, released by the United Nations in October, said the world only has about a decade to rein in emissions before irreversible catastrophic impacts begin.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump is withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate accord and is in the process of rolling back nearly a dozen climate regulations. A report in The New York Times this week showed how these moves present an opportunity for Democrats. An Indiana county that voted overwhelmingly for Trump has seen a rash of childhood cancer, and recent tests at an old industrial site revealed \u201ca carcinogenic plume spreading underground, releasing vapors into homes.\u201d The specific chemical\u2014trichloroethylene, or TCE\u2014is one for which Trump wants to weaken restrictions.\n\nThe increasingly dire news about global warming, and Trump\u2019s furious assault on climate regulations, have turned the issue into one of the top priorities among Democratic voters. As the party\u2019s base shifts left, it\u2019s demanding more aggressive positions from politicians\u2014and applying more aggressive tactics against politicians who don\u2019t. Nearly 150 activists were arrested in one of two protests the Sunrise Movement held at the U.S. Capitol late last year, where they demand that Democrat leaders like Nancy Pelosi explicitly support the specifics of a Green New Deal.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, people are going to be actually listening intently to what Democrats have to say about climate change,\u201d Rogers-Wright said. \u201cAnd there are gonna be some people running who have some explaining to do.\u201d Stephen O\u2019Hanlon, Sunrise\u2019s communications director, said the group is \u201cfocused on pushing all the candidates to back the Green New Deal and reject fossil fuel money, which is the minimum they need to do in order to be taken seriously by our generation.\u201d\n\nThe 2020 candidates are all vulnerable in one way or another. Warren is far from the only potential Democratic presidential candidate who hasn\u2019t signed the pledge; Booker, Harris, Inslee, and O\u2019Rourke haven\u2019t as well. In O\u2019Rourke\u2019s case, he had signed the pledge while running his unsuccessful Senate campaign against Ted Cruz, but was removed after it was revealed that he accepted $430,000 from oil and gas industry employees. That\u2019s a potential deal-breaker for some. \u201cSolving climate change requires essentially dismantling the fossil fuel industry,\u201d Rogers-Wright said. \u201cHow can we expect you\u2019re going to dismantle a group that\u2019s investing in you?\u201d\n\nBut being the leftmost Democrat on climate change is no guarantee of support, either. Merkley has signed the no-fossil-fuels pledge, and has been a leader in introducing climate legislation in the Senate, but Rogers-Wright questioned his effectiveness. \u201cYou have to do so much more than have the policy to solve the climate crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will require a lawmaker who is skilled at bringing people together and holding people together, and I don\u2019t know that Merkley has those chops.\u201d\n\nSo who is leading the pack, as far as climate activists are concerned?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure anyone is really excited [about the 2020 field] yet,\u201d said Miller of Climate Hawks Vote. O\u2019Hanlon said that Sunrise has met with staffers from a number of potential candidates, \u201cand right now don\u2019t have a favorite.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not surprising, given the early stage of the race. The question is whether any candidate will do enough to satisfy some activists. As Rogers-Wright noted, the Democratic Party has not developed a plan to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cSure, they believe in [climate change],\u201d Rogers-Wright said. \u201cBut as it pertains to acting on it, they\u2019ve been anemic at best.\u201d\n\nIn fact, none of the potential Democratic candidates\u2014aside from Sanders, who ran in 2016\u2014has released such a plan, either. But there is time yet for that, and pressure from environmentalists may well compel them to do so. As Miller said, \u201cThis is finally going to be the climate election that we\u2019ve been waiting for.\u201d"

    "authors": [
      "Matt Ford"
    ],
    "text": "All three of those governors hail from the Republican Party, which traditionally favored tough-on-crime policies. But even Democratic governors can be stingy. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo made headlines last month when he pardoned 22 immigrants who faced deportation or couldn\u2019t apply for citizenship because of previous state convictions. The pardons gave Cuomo a chance to cast himself as a leading figure in the Democratic resistance to President Trump. But with almost 200,000 New Yorkers in prison, probation, or parole, issuing fewer than two dozen pardons is hardly a courageous act.\n\nPardoning incarcerated people or commuting their sentences largely fell out of vogue during the tough-on-crime era at both the state and federal level. Harry Truman issued more than 1,900 pardons during his tenure, while Dwight D. Eisenhower handed out more than 1,100 throughout his eight years in office. That number fell even as prison populations exploded in the 1980s and 1990s: George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush collectively issued fewer than 700 pardons during their quarter-century in power. Though comparable figures for the nation\u2019s governors aren\u2019t readily available, they\u2019ve reportedly shown a similar aversion to clemency since the 1960s.\n\nWhat would it look like if governors pursued a more aggressive approach to their clemency powers? Jerry Brown, California\u2019s outgoing governor, carved out a model of sorts. The state\u2019s longtime leader spent his fourth and final term in office setting a national benchmark for clemency: The Times of San Diego reported that Brown has pardoned at least 1,332 inmates since 2011, quadrupling the number issued by the preceding four governors combined. The burst of activity is particularly stark compared to his two immediate predecessors, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Gray Davis, who respectively issued fifteen and zero pardons.\n\nThose who have received pardons from Brown cut a broad swath, ranging from a couple that lost their home in the devastating Camp Fire last month to five Cambodian-born immigrants who feared deportation by the Trump administration. In a slate of Christmas Eve pardons, the governor also ordered new DNA tests for Kevin Cooper, a death-row inmate who says that local police framed him for a quadruple homicide in the 1980s. For Brown, there\u2019s a self-redemptive element at play. He previously served as California\u2019s governor from 1975 to 1983, right at the cusp of the nation\u2019s turn toward harsher sentencing laws and mass incarceration.\n\nSolid-blue states aren\u2019t the only ones where governors have made bold use of their clemency powers. Terry McAuliffe, a moderate Democrat who led Virginia from 2014 to 2018, initially tried to restore voting rights to almost 200,000 former felons with a single executive order in 2016. After the state supreme court struck down his sweeping order later that year, McAuliffe began to issue them on a person-by-person basis, restoring the franchise to more than 173,000 citizens by the time he left office. Ralph Northam, his successor, has continued the clemency program on a rolling basis as prisoners return to society."

    "text": "Juventus, meanwhile, issued a statement praising Ronaldo\u2019s \u201cprofessionalism and dedication,\u201d adding, \u201cThe events allegedly dating back to almost 10 years ago do not change this opinion, which is shared by anyone who has come into contact with this great champion.\u201d Fernando Gomes, president of Portugal\u2019s soccer federation, said, \u201cIn my name and in the name of the Portuguese Football Federation, I express total solidarity with Cristiano Ronaldo, in a circumstance where his good name and reputation are at risk.\u201d\n\nSome Italian news outlets ignored the rape accusation until it started to affect Juventus\u2019 share price, said Susy Campanale, a soccer journalist who edits the Football Italia website. (The club\u2019s stock stabilized in late October.) And some papers explicitly sided with him. \u201cCristiano Crucified,\u201d declared the sports daily Corriere dello Sport. Tuttosport ran his photograph beside the headline \u201cPi\u00f9 forte del fango,\u201d or \u201cstronger than the mud-slinging.\u201d\n\nOn social media, Italian soccer fans initially split along partisan lines, with Juventus supporters defending him and rivals reveling in the possibility of his downfall. But what controversy there was has since subsided. \u201cPeople in Italy didn\u2019t care about it at all,\u201d said Ilaria Maroni, an Italian sports writer based in New York. \u201cThe majority of the people didn\u2019t believe the story was true. They only believed the girl wanted to get more money out of it.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo wit, the Italian newspaper La Repubblica was inundated with hostile comments after publishing a letter in October from a 27-year-old woman who criticized Juventus\u2019 statement of support for Ronaldo. Mayorga \u201ccannot say she has been raped,\u201d one commenter wrote. \u201cEither she was giving consent, or she staged the whole thing to get money.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was disconcerting, yet really not that surprising, to see the reaction from women,\u201d said Campanale, of Football Italia. \u201cThey tended to range from \u2018He\u2019s rich, handsome and successful, he doesn\u2019t need to rape anybody\u2019 to \u2018If a woman is raped, she goes to the police straight away and doesn\u2019t accept a payout.\u2019\u201d\n\nMayorga has not spoken publicly since Der Spiegel published the story, and her lawyer, Leslie Stovall, did not respond to a request for comment. But Antje Windmann, one of the reporters who worked on the story for Der Spiegel, said she has spoken with Mayorga about the reaction to her allegation. \u201cShe was desperate and heartbroken about what people think about her now\u2014that she wants his money or that she\u2019s a disappointed lover,\u201d Windmann said. \u201cShe felt completely helpless.\u201d\n\nThe allegation is not the first #MeToo claim to meet a cold reception in Italy. After Italian film actress and director Asia Argento accused Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault in 2017, she said she felt \u201cdoubly crucified\u201d\u2014first by the assault itself, then by the hostile reaction in her home country. Argento\u2019s case offers a prime example of Italy\u2019s broader \u201cvictim-blaming culture,\u201d said Farren, the Women\u2019s March organizer.\n\n\u201c#MeToo, I think it\u2019s fair to say, just has not been a cultural phenomenon in Italy the way it has been elsewhere,\u201d said Rachel Vogelstein, who runs the Women and Foreign Policy Program at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThe media still remains hostile to women who speak out, so I think the conversation continues to remain an uphill battle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Happens When the World\u2019s Most Famous Athlete Is Accused of Rape?\u201d a New York magazine story asked in early October. \u201cThis is the most famous athlete on the planet credibly accused of a heinous crime of sexual assault,\u201d Will Leitch wrote, referring to Ronaldo. \u201cIt is unprecedented, and it is going to tell us everything about how the world of #MeToo is either going to crash against the world of sports or become a part of it.\u201d\n\nThe answer thus far to the article\u2019s question is clear: Not much happens at all. Ronaldo continues to play every week, with nary a mention about the allegations against him.\n\nWhile Italy\u2019s resistance to the #MeToo movement has certainly helped Ronaldo, so too has his prowess on the pitch. \u201cSoccer is an extremely protective environment\u201d in Italy, Farren said. \u201cSoccer comes before almost anything.\u201d But it\u2019s not just soccer. #MeToo has yet to make inroads in the sports world, where tribal affinities often outweigh ethical concerns\u2014even in the U.S., where the movement originated and has been the most influential.\n\nBig-name American athletes have been accused of sexual misconduct over the years, often with only minor consequences. Former L.A. Lakers guard Kobe Bryant and Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger were accused of sexual assault at the peak of their careers; they lost endorsement deals, but not their jobs. Their cases also predated #MeToo. In a more recent case, quarterback Jameis Winston was the number-one pick in the 2015 NFL draft despite a rape accusation against him, and he continued to play this season after a second allegation surfaced in September.\n\n\u201cBroadly speaking, the world of professional sports to date has not really been significantly changed by #MeToo,\u201d said Vogelstein, the Council on Foreign Relations official. \u201cThat world is really notorious for silencing claims of sexual violence.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe accusation against Ronaldo differs in some important respects from many of the stories that have surfaced during the #MeToo era. Mayorga was not Ronaldo\u2019s subordinate, or even involved in the sports industry; he was unlikely to make or break her career. Unlike Weinstein or Bill Cosby, Ronaldo has not been charged with a crime. It\u2019s possible that soccer fans, the media, and corporate sponsors are withholding judgment until Las Vegas police completes its investigation. Then again, accused men have suffered professional repercussions before the conclusion of official inquiries, or even in their absence.\n\n\n\nThe muted reaction may have more to do with the gender dynamics of sports than the details of the legal process. \u201cSports fandom is so invested in this elite form of masculinity that really in some ways is consistent with sexual aggression,\u201d said Susan Cahn, a history professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo who studies gender in sports. \u201cMale athletes in their prime really represent a kind of virility that\u2019s physical but also sexual.\u201d\n\nFans \u201cwant to escape daily life, and so anything that enters into the sports realm or enters into this escape mechanism really turns them off,\u201d said Adam Earnheardt, an expert on sports fandom who chairs the communications department at Youngstown State University in Ohio. When NFL players knelt during the national anthem, some fans were upset simply because the protests \u201cwere violating their escape,\u201d Earnheardt said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to think about politics.\u201d\n\nStill, he said, Roethlisberger faced criticism from fans who once cheered for him. And memories of the accusation against Bryant have lingered: In October, he was removed from the jury of a cartoon film festival he was slated to judge after backlash from the animation community. \u201cThe Ronaldo story would have had greater attention, would have had probably a bigger reaction, if he were a sports star in the United States,\u201d Earnheardt said.\n\nJuventus has ten official supporters clubs in the United States. Fabrizio Capobianco, an Italian expat, founded the Silicon Valley branch in 2015. He said his club\u2019s membership has almost doubled, to more than 100 people, since Ronaldo joined the team. \u201cHe has changed the way the team plays,\u201d Capobianco said. \u201cThey just walk into the pitch knowing they are going to win because the best player on the planet is playing with them.\u201d\n\nAs for the rape accusation, Capobianco says it hasn\u2019t been a major concern for the California-based Juventus fans who gather every weekend to cheer on their new hero. In Italy, he noted, \u201cSoccer is first and everything else comes after.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs long as he doesn\u2019t actually go to jail and he can play on Sunday, I think people will be fine,\u201d Capobianco said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this disappears.\u201d"

New York and Virginia had agreed to subsidize helipads for Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos; Virginia even promised to help the company fight Freedom of Information Act requests.\n\nIt would be easy to assume that most of the objections to Amazon\u2019s HQ2 deal would come from the left. Senator Elizabeth Warren was, after all, one of the first politicians to criticize Amazon for monopolistic practices, arguing that the e-commerce giant and companies like it had eroded what was once a \u201cstrong, robust middle class.\u201d But disdain for corporate concentration is one of the rare things in contemporary American politics that transcends ideological divisions.\n\nTake Montana Senator Jon Tester, one of only two Democrats in the Senate to be reelected in a blood red state. Last year, he attacked the secretary of agriculture, complaining that meatpackers continue to \u201cexploit farmers and ranchers\u201d by manipulating the price they pay for livestock. Even corporate-friendly Democrats can sound downright populist on the subject. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a former venture capitalist who made his $200 million fortune off early cell phone technology, has emerged as a leading critic of the tech giants, noting how they kill competition and threaten national security.\n\nOpposition to monopoly also brings the left and the center together with unlikely allies. Perhaps the most power\u00adful critique of corporate concentration in recent months has come from The Economist, which has attacked the American antitrust establishment for laxness. And when Ocasio-Cortez spoke out against the Amazon deal, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board and the National Review both praised her. \u201cI hate to admit it, but Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has a very good point,\u201d said Fox News\u2019s Tucker Carlson. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to argue with the internal logic.... The richest man in the world just got $2 billion in taxpayer subsidies. How does that work?\u201d"

    "text": "Mexico, for all the catastrophizing by politicians, the media, and NGO researchers, remains a country in flux rather than crisis. Its violent crime rate, while the source of horrific massacres and mass disappearances, is lower than those of Venezuela, Brazil, or Colombia. Its burgeoning high-tech and manufacturing sectors are the most productive and innovative in Latin America. And its current economic performance\u2014relatively low, if consistent, growth\u2014while disappointing to many, can be considered an improvement on the 20th century when Mexico lurched from crisis to crisis, depending on oil prices.\n\nUltimately, where Mexico continues to struggle is in the consolidation of democratic institutions and the rule of law\u2014the legacy of decades of authoritarianism. Weak public institutions undermine everything from criminal justice to the implementation of social welfare policy and prevent any government, right or left, from meeting its goals. They permit corruption to continue, and serve as background to the catastrophic images of death and mayhem that flit across our screens after the latest drug war massacre.\n\nMany in western academia and journalism continue to consider neoliberalism the region\u2019s primary problem.\n\nYet this is generally not the discussion being had on the left with regards to Latin America. Many in western academia and journalism continue to consider neoliberalism the region\u2019s primary problem. This posture was first adopted by the left in the 1990s during the alter-globalization movement, itself partly inspired by Mexico\u2019s 1994 \u201cZapatista\u201d uprising, and has endured as the foremost leftist critique of Latin American governments to this day. While many of the criticisms of the rapid implementation of liberalizing market policies were justified, they rarely appreciated the context of the times or distinguished between positive reforms and negative ones.\n\nMexico\u2019s market reforms, after all, were spurred by serious problems. While the Mexican economy, propelled by oil revenues, grew rapidly during the mid-20th century, state-backed monopolies filled with political cronies only served to suppress innovation and entrepreneurship, while state intervention in the economy through land reform and price controls simply maintained one-party hegemony, culminating in the disastrous Latin American Debt Crisis of 1982. Notably, Mexico today is growing more robustly in its north, which has been quicker to embrace industrialization and global trade, than its rural and politically volatile south, which only seems to fall further back.\n\nAMLO\u2019s policy proposals are not so much radical or innovative as retro. Steeped in nationalist symbolism, his economic plans in particular echo the country\u2019s leftist leaders of the 1970s, whose profligate spending contributed to the 1982 debt crisis. Specifically, he has suggested considerable public reinvestment in Mexico\u2019s corrupt, unwieldy energy giant, Pemex, implicated in the region-wide Odebrecht scandal; a revival of the agricultural sector, which was in steep decline even before the market reforms; and increased public spending. After decades of financing development via oil revenues and foreign loans, such increased spending cannot now occur sustainably without tax reform\u2014something AMLO so far has resisted."

    "text": "What makes more sense? It\u2019s not necessarily a clear-cut choice. Market-based health care has proven more expensive everywhere it\u2019s been tried, and as practiced in the United States it leads to worse outcomes. Even there, however, market competition can yield success. One of Warren\u2019s biggest legislative victories involved breaking up the hearing aid oligopoly, which required doctor prescriptions for all audiological devices. Since passing a Warren-written law allowing for FDA-approved, over-the-counter hearing aids without medical evaluation, competitors have jumped into the space, driving down the cost of audio assistance for everyone.\n\nLiberals prefer the concept of a mixed economy\u2014which even Sanders supports, more than his democratic socialist branding would imply. Competition can come from the public sector or the private sector: Breaking up the banks through size caps, or separating their investment and deposit-taking wings, gets you to the same place functionally. The public sector may be better positioned to build a road, and the private sector better positioned to sell you sandwiches.\n\nThere\u2019s room for this mixture, but only if markets are bent to the will of the people, as in Warren\u2019s conception. As long as the private sector can get away with pursuing profit at the expense of the public, even the deepest interventions into the market might not succeed. Even under single-payer health care, private hospitals and other providers would still be delivering medical care, and they are so concentrated that they would still facilitate waste and frustrate outcomes. Plus, on a practical basis you can certainly restructure markets faster, in many cases without new approval from Congress. For example, antitrust laws still exist, and regulators with sufficient political will can start enforcing them.\n\nSanders\u2019s policies are appealing to voters in the way that throwing out a system that doesn\u2019t work is inevitably more appealing than tweaking it. But fighting corporate power and making the rules work for people can also resonate on the campaign trail. Warren has been talking about how the game is rigged as long as Sanders has.\n\nThat\u2019s why you see competitors to Warren and Sanders alternately picking up market-restructuring and market-overhaul policies. Senator Cory Booker wants to transfer wealth to young people through a social wealth fund, and also block mergers in food and agriculture markets. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand wants a public option with postal banking and a financial transaction tax to nudge markets away from securities trading.\n\nThe decision between Warren and Sanders as the standard-bearer on the left is not merely about personality or electability. It will have implications about what Democrats stand for: a party that wants to make capitalism work for everyone, or one that will nationalize parts of capitalism that don\u2019t work. Ultimately, Democratic voters will have to decide which vision they prefer."

    "text": "BERLIN by Jason Lutes Drawn & Quarterly, 580 pp., $49.95\n\nJason Lutes first started drawing Berlin, his epic graphic novel about the disintegration of the Weimar Republic, in 1996, when the topic seemed an esoteric choice for an American storyteller. The winding down of the Cold War brought with it an ostensible closure of the ideological battles of the early 20th century, leading some of the more triumphalist partisans of capitalism to proclaim nothing less than the end of human history. The future seemed more or less certain: America\u2019s free-market, liberal democratic model would continue to prevail as the best of all possible worlds.\n\nYet in going back to the apparently irrelevant past, Lutes became an inadvertent prophet. The cartoonist patiently drew his story in short, irregularly released pamphlets, gathered together every few years in paperback collections. When he finally finished the project and codified it in a hefty hardcover in 2018, what had once been antiquarian was now urgent. In the fraying and polarized America of Donald Trump, the Weimar Republic looks more like a mirror than a fading photograph.\n\nWhen I first started reading Berlin more than two decades ago, I primarily admired it as a bravura feat of historical reconstruction. Everything\u2014the trains, the buildings, the fashion, the faces\u2014looked right, a testament not just to archival research but also, more importantly, to a style that channeled the imagery of the era. Lutes\u2019s clean, brisk cartooning owes much to Herg\u00e9 (the creator of Tintin), but there is more than a dash of noir taken from German Expressionism and the woodcut novels that flourished in the 1920s and 1930s (notably those by artist Frans Masereel). The style has an uncanny aptness, as if the book were a product of the very period it surveys.\n\nCourtesy of Drawn & Quarterly\n\nThe book\u2019s physical presence is also a marriage of form and content. In size and weight, Berlin is a building block of a book, reminiscent of the cobblestones, bricks, and concrete slabs that make up the titular city. Cartoonists refer to the white spaces between the panels in a graphic novel as \u201cgutters,\u201d and the street metaphor is particularly appropriate for Berlin. Reading a graphic novel, especially one as dense with geographical information as Berlin, is akin to deciphering a map. The inside cover of Berlin is, in fact, a map of the city, which reinforces the experience of the book as a kind of urban guide in narrative form.\n\n"

    "text": "The recovery facility is funded mostly by donors and the state of Kentucky. The main contributor in 2016 was Kentucky\u2019s Justice & Public Safety Cabinet, which donated\n\n$500,000. Adam Bisaga, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center, strongly believes that programs withholding effective treatments, intentionally or unintentionally, should not receive public funding: \u201cPublic resources, especially when limited, should be steered towards the most effective interventions.\u201d\n\nAlcoholics Anonymous was founded 83 years ago, 330 miles northeast of Louisville, in Akron, Ohio. Prohibition had recently been lifted, and alcohol consumption was on the rise. In 1935, Bill Wilson and Bob Smith, a stockbroker and a surgeon, started A.A., and formulated 12 principles to guide alcoholics to sobriety.\n\nToday, with an estimated two million members, A.A. is deeply ingrained in American culture. In 2012 the Library of Congress designated the founding text\u2014The Big Book\u2014as one of 88 \u201cBooks that Shaped America.\u201d The organization is, in many ways, the bedrock of American addiction treatment. In 2016, 73 percent of all treatment facilities used the 12 Step approach.\n\nOver the course of nearly a century, the 12 Steps have helped millions of people quit alcohol, pills, and needles\u2014and given them a place to share and heal. But Clay, a public information coordinator at Alcoholics Anonymous, is fully aware that people receiving MAT do not always have the chance of benefiting from the fellowship. Instead, many feel excluded by their peers. \u201cThere are people in A.A. that have an orthodoxy,\u201d Clay acknowledged. \u201cThey think that A.A. must be this. So yes. These things are going on. There is no orthodoxy in A.A., but there are people who believe that.\u201d Clay\u2019s comments offer a rare window into an organization that is known for its secrecy. He works at A.A.\u2019s headquarters in New York City, and, as an active member, has asked to be identified only by his first name.\n\nA.A.\u2019s official stance is that it has no opinion, positive or negative, on MAT. But it will not interfere if groups exclude people on Suboxone or methadone: \u201cThat\u2019s the one thing we can\u2019t do. Because, we have no authority,\u201d Clay said, referring to the unyielding principle that every A.A. group is self-governed and fully autonomous.\n\nTo Bisaga of Columbia University Medical Center, that is not a valid excuse: \u201cIt is unacceptable that A.A. does not have a position, because they do not want to adjust to change. They are still functioning the way they did, when they were born in the 1930s,\u201d he said. Bisaga, the author of Overcoming Opioid Addiction, is co-director for the organization PCSS-MAT, which advocates for MAT. \u201cIt is unfortunate that they don\u2019t have a clear stance in line with all professional medical organizations, including the WHO,\u201d he added.\n\nA.A.\u2019s founders stated that its methods are meant for alcoholism only. But today the popular 12 Steps are used in treating everything from compulsive gambling to sex addiction, and dozens of organizations have sprung from A.A. In the early 1950s, when people struggling with drugs started knocking on A.A.\u2019s door, Narcotics Anonymous was established. With an estimated 67,000 meetings a week, it is by far the largest of the organizations that follow A.A.\u2019s model.\n\nClay said that people who mainly have a drug problem ideally should seek help at an organization like Narcotics Anonymous. However, that may not help a recovering opioid addict on MAT. Because, unlike A.A., N.A. does take a stance on MAT. In the eyes of Narcotics Anonymous, people in recovery are not clean before they abstain from all drugs\u2014including Suboxone and methadone. And so N.A. advises its member groups not to let individuals on MAT share at meetings, be speakers or sponsors, or hold any trusted positions within the organization.\n\n\n\nFor some people, the only way to stay alive is to stay on medication for the rest of their lives.\n\nThis stance was made clear most recently in an official N.A. pamphlet from 2016, drawing from the 1996 Bulletin no. 29 \u201cRegarding Methadone and Other Drug Replacement Programs.\u201d In this text, a phrase appears that will sound familiar to David, Michael, and countless other addicts in recovery: \u201cOur program approaches recovery from addiction through abstinence, cautioning against the substitution of one drug for another.\u201d\n\nArnaout, the professor at Yale School of Medicine, urged Narcotics Anonymous to change its view on MAT and encourage its members to seek treatment: \u201cIt would be appropriate if they said: \u2018We are here to support you, but you should see someone in the health care system, too.\u2019\u201d\n\nBob, who works in public relations for Narcotics Anonymous World Services, confirmed that some groups may discourage people from actively participating. \u201cBecause that goes against our core tenant of complete abstinence,\u201d he explained. Bob, like Clay, has asked not to have his last name published. A member on medication-assisted treatment is not officially clean, according to N.A.\u2019s definition. \u201cHopefully it will be a goal for them, and their doctor, not to take medication for the rest of their life,\u201d Bob said.\n\nBisaga does not agree. For some people, he said, the only way to stay alive is to stay on medication for the rest of their lives: \u201cIf we do not accept that, we\u2019ll just continue to have people dying.\u201d Bisaga regards it as a great loss that N.A. does not embrace MAT: \u201cWe do really want people to have medication, but we also want people to benefit from the recovery community.\u201d\n\nThe loss is especially felt in places like Louisville, where the opioid epidemic runs deep. About the time that David Hockenbury and Michael Dever began experimenting with drugs\u2014when they were angry teens in baggy clothes and Timberland boots, their hair spiked with gel\u2014a big story in the world of health was the under-treatment of pain. Chronic pain, long neglected, was taken up by patient advocates, who demanded better treatment options. Pharmaceutical lobbyists quickly picked up on the trend, pushing for wider prescriptions and the use of more potent opioid-based products. The initiative was embraced by Kentucky\u2019s coal miners and other manual laborers.\n\nThe first time the boys experimented with pills was when David\u2019s girlfriend gave them some of her mother\u2019s Xanax. It didn\u2019t take much of an effort to find more. At parties, David and Michael would nose around in cabinets overflowing with Xanax, Valium, Klonopin, and Benzos of all shapes and sizes. They would take out the powder, snort it, and fill the empty pill cases with sugar. Michael and David could not see that they were part of a vast epidemic spreading in their town, their state, and all across the country.\n\nMichael Dever has accepted that he\u2019ll probably be on methadone for the rest of his life: \u201cIt enables me to live a normal, stable life and get up and go to work every morning and be productive, and not be on heroin shooting up three or four times a day.\u201d\n\nWhen they both landed themselves in the hospital\u201420-year-old David after a car crash, 17-year-old Michael with a stomach condition\u2014they were sent home on heavy opioids. First Percocet. Then OxyContin. Every chemical was stronger than the previous one. And when their hospital stashes diminished and cravings kicked in, they turned to the street.\n\nLittle by little, news coverage of pain treatment gave way to stories about the millions of Americans who were becoming dependent on opioids. Crackdowns were launched. Prescription opioids became less accessible, and much more expensive. Suddenly 80 mg of OxyContin had a street price of $60.\n\nFor David and Michael, rowdiness turned into violence and weapon charges as a drug-filled lifestyle led them into more serious crime. That was also when they began to seek out a cheaper, more efficient option: heroin. Their lives followed a by-now familiar trajectory. There were blackouts and overdoses, visits to the hospital; there was jail time.\n\nIn 2009, the number of Americans who died from an overdose surpassed the number who died from being shot. In 2011, overdoses surpassed deaths by car accidents.\n\nThe opioid crisis had its origin in the rural heart of America, but is now spreading to the cities. From July 2016 through September 2017, overdoses increased by 30 percent across the country. The Midwest, Appalachia, and New England are losing the most lives to the epidemic. In 2016, Kentucky had the fifth-highest rate of death due to drug overdose.\n\nThere still aren\u2019t many support groups beyond A.A., and few places in Louisville provide a sanctuary for people on MAT. Medically Assisted Treatment To Recovery (MATTR) was founded in August of last year as a response to people on MAT feeling excluded from other recovery groups. At a meeting at the boardroom of the Morton Center addiction facility in January, four pale women found seats at the large table. \u201cBefore you say congratulations, I just want to say that I\u2019m not pregnant,\u201d one said. \u201cI\u2019m just really, really constipated.\u201d Others restlessly scratched their arms and necks. Numbness, tingling, trouble concentrating\u2014all are common side effects of the Suboxone they take, along with constipation.\n\nThe meeting was led by co-founder Andrea Jones, and the group was eager to share. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Diana. My sobriety day is 12 22 2017,\u201d said a young woman wearing sweatpants and a washed-out Batman t-shirt, absentmindedly scratching the inside of both elbows with blue polished nails. (The names of the MATTR attendees have been changed.) It was her first day on Suboxone, and the decision to start taking it had not been easy. \u201cI was so confused. Because so many people were already judging and telling me not to do the treatment. I didn\u2019t know how to think.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, the number of Americans who died from an overdose surpassed the number who died from being shot. In 2011, overdoses surpassed deaths by car accidents.\n\nThe medicine was audible in the slow, soft croak of her voice. It usually takes a few days for the body to adjust. But today, for the first time in a long while, she had not thought about running off and doing drugs, she told the group. \u201cI want to be open about it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this is like one of the only places I can be open about it.\u201d\n\nNext, Jessica, a petite woman with a bun of brown curls and large golden earrings, shared her story. An addiction to heroin and methamphetamine had brought her here. \u201cI went from smoking weed a little bit every day to being five months pregnant with my second daughter, shooting up in a gas station bathroom, begging God to just let me die.\u201d She stopped and took a deep shuddering breath. \u201cMAT saved my life.\u201d\n\nThe others nodded in sympathy and thanked her for sharing. Samantha, the young woman with the swollen belly, took over. She was pretty, but the sickly pallor of her skin and her expressionless face made her resemble a mugshot. In a slow Southern drawl, she told the group that her boyfriend broke up with her when he found out she was on Suboxone. \u201cHe said that I\u2019m just getting on MAT to get legal, cheap high.\u201d\n\nSome 12 Step meetings openly prohibit the use of MAT. But more often, these women were shamed out of meetings by other participants. They were told that their all-important sobriety date was false and that they were not truly sober. Jessica was even kicked out from a meeting when the other participants learned that she was on Suboxone. \u201cPeople are just uneducated about it. For one, it\u2019s not a high. If anything, I\u2019m exhausted,\u201d she said, sinking back in the large office chair. \u201cBut it slows my brain down enough to let me do what I need to do that day.\u201d Her voice thickened and tears welled in her eyes.\n\nDiana\u2019s voice rose: \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to worry about this. I\u2019ve literally drawn myself into an anxiety attack because I don\u2019t know how the world will react to this.\u201d They had all had close friends, even family, question their medicine. \u201cI may be on something to maintain me,\u201d Diana added. \u201cBut I\u2019m not gonna abuse it. There\u2019s a difference between abstinence and sobriety. You\u2019re doing something to recover. That counts.\u201d\n\nShe delivered the last statement with defiance, as if trying to convince someone.\n\nWhen N.A. member Amber suggests to people on MAT that they get off of their medicine, she does so politely. She has talked to people like the women from MATTR, and advised them against maintenance drugs: \u201cI would encourage you to get off of Suboxone,\u201d she said, reminding them that it can be bought off the streets and used to get high. Amber, who has also asked to be identified by her first name, had tried Suboxone herself, but said she felt that her doctors pressured her into taking it. They would tell her that if she just took this medication, she would not need to get high anymore. To Amber, however, it felt like \u201csubstituting one drug for another,\u201d as she said. Today, she is one of many N.A. and A.A. members who have a clear stance on MAT: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be on Suboxone.\u201d\n\nBut to many addicts on MAT, like David and Michael, this approach feels like cruel and needless banishment. With the help of methadone, Michael has been sober since last summer. David, after years of relapses and recovery, recently chose to quit A.A. and find a support group open to everyone\u2014including people on MAT. Today, he has been sober for over a year. Still, last fall he decided to wean off medication again. Prescriptions and visits to the doctor cost him almost the same as rent. But that was not the only reason. The negative opinions toward MAT among his peers in A.A. continued to bother him: \u201cComing from this absolutist black-and-white recovery community, where you had to be totally abstinent and off of everything, I still had pressure in my own mind to get off MAT.\u201d\n\nThe hunt for complete abstinence still haunts many of the people they know\u2014or have known. \u201cIf five years ago there was no stigma attached to MAT and if it was accessible and affordable, I think a lot of our friends would probably still be alive,\u201d Michael said in January in a Starbucks on the outskirts of Louisville.\n\n\u201cHow many people have died that we were friends with?\u201d he asked David, who was calmly sipping a bottle of orange juice.\n\nBoth of them looked distant. Losing a friend had long ceased being an extraordinary event.\n\n\u201cJesse, Mike, Muff.\u201d\n\nThey counted on their fingers, but ran out of fingers to count.\n\n\u201cBurford, Kyle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019d you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cNoodle.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah. Noodle.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Devon?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then the people I know from A.A. It\u2019s an even larger number,\u201d David said.\n\n\u201cJon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, and Erica, she died that same day,\u201d David said quietly. He was the one who talked her into going to A.A., where she eventually decided to stop taking methadone. She relapsed and died.\n\nHe shrugged. \u201cI lose count. I think it\u2019s at least 30. And at least 15 of my close, close friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean really, it\u2019s just me and you and two other friends from our old group that are still alive,\u201d Michael said.\n\nIf everybody needs a tribe, most of theirs is gone."

    "text": "The experience of reading this book is at times like watching somebody run into a wall they can\u2019t see, over and over again, while they describe the wounds they\u2019re sustaining in minute and entertaining detail. From a different angle, it\u2019s akin to watching a young woman coming to political consciousness in her personal relationships. In one early passage, Roberson describes her revelation that all this emotional labor was sapping her brainpower:\n\nI came to this conclusion when a guy was giving me strange signals for months and I was using my brain to its full capacity trying to figure out what the hell was going on. I realized: oh, this is a political issue, because instead of focusing on the intersectional-socialist-matriarchal revolution I\u2019ve been focusing on whether or not what just happened was a date.\n\nAnd there she stays. What follows this revelation is a forensic investigation into how that mental sabotage happens, rather than particularly useful advice on how to survive it. There is some value in this: Books of feminist cultural commentary usually speak from a position of having understood, rather than doing the exhausting work of trying to understand.\n\nFurthermore, Roberson\u2019s achievement in remaining funny while excavating her pain is just straightforwardly heroic. Here\u2019s Roberson on letting unenthusiastic men go free, for example: \u201cI am not trying to trick men who aren\u2019t totally aboard the SS Blythe Is Hot and Fun into marrying me. I\u2019m not trying to trap men! Except Harry Styles, but I\u2019m not trying to trap him into dating me, I\u2019m just trying to trap him.\u201d\n\nBy the end of How to Date Men When You Hate Men I couldn\u2019t help but wonder\u2014have you considered political lesbianism, Blythe Roberson? It might sound like a joke, but the concept has enjoyed a resurgence in contemporary feminism. Sprouting from the radical feminist movement within the 1970s second wave, political lesbianism is related to lesbian separatism, and promotes the idea that a woman can break from heterosexuality and simply refuse to incorporate sex with men into their lives. (The separatist movement has been sullied lately by adopting transphobic rhetoric, but its influence remains.)\n\nOne seminal text from 1981\u2014\u201cLove Your Enemy? The Debate Between Heterosexual Feminism and Political Lesbianism\u201d\u2014by the Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group argues that, \u201cThe heterosexual couple is the basic unit of the political structure of male supremacy.\u201d Any feminist \u201ccan and should be political lesbians,\u201d they write. Roberson\u2019s book almost reads like evidence collected by the lesbian separatist prosecution, but it comes down in favor of the messier, more real problems of trying to live in a world where desire for men just can\u2019t be dispensed with that easily. Embedded within How To Date Men When You Hate Men is the insoluble truth that Roberson both desires and loathes men. She forces herself to acknowledge that double bind, then persists through the paradox instead of opting out."

    "text": "That\u2019s a fair reading of Romney\u2019s op-ed. \u201cIt is not that all of the president\u2019s policies have been misguided,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe was right to align U.S. corporate taxes with those of global competitors, to strip out excessive regulations, to crack down on China\u2019s unfair trade practices, to reform criminal justice and to appoint conservative judges. These are policies mainstream Republicans have promoted for years. But policies and appointments are only a part of a presidency.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s most striking about the op-ed is what it doesn\u2019t mention. There are no complaints about Trump\u2019s draconian approach to immigration, perhaps because Romney himself helped pave the way for his hardline policies. During the 2012 primaries, he outflanked the rest of the field from the right by calling for policies that would pressure immigrants to \u201cself-deport\u201d as an alternative to mass deportations. The years have not tempered his views: \u201cI\u2019m also more of a hawk on immigration than even the president,\u201d Romney told a Utah crowd in March.\n\n\n\n\n\nRomney\u2019s op-ed reveals a selective memory at play. His version of events begins with his own decision not to endorse Trump in 2016. But during the 2012 campaign,\n\nRomney appeared alongside Trump to accept his endorsement, a decision that helped pave the way for Trump\u2019s subsequent rise to power: It validated his racist campaign to pressure President Obama into releasing his birth certificate, and signaled that he had power and influence within the Republican Party. Romney\u2019s pointed non-endorsement in 2016 was too late to wash away the imprimatur of legitimacy.\n\nThe narrative also, conveniently for Romney, focuses on what happened in the last month of 2018. \u201cThe Trump presidency made a deep descent in December,\u201d his op-ed began, as he lamented the departures of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, and other figures whom establishment Republicans saw as stabilizing figures within the administration. Criticizing Trump\u2019s actions prior to the midterm elections would have been slightly awkward for Romney: He welcomed the president\u2019s endorsement in his own Senate campaign.\n\nSome observers rushed to praise Romney for his perceived declaration of independence. \u201cFor better or worse, Mitt Romney has joined the resistance,\u201d The Week\u2019s Joel Mathis wrote on Wednesday. Rick Wilson, a prominent #NeverTrump conservative consultant, was euphoric. \u201cYes, we\u2019ve seen a handful of truth-tellers in the Senate,\u201d he wrote in The Daily Beast, \u201cbut they rarely hit so keenly as today\u2019s Romney nuke strike.\u201d If complaining that Trump has not \u201crisen to the mantle of his office\u201d is a nuclear detonation, even the most conservative of Democrats should be sent to the Hague."

New York and Virginia had agreed to subsidize helipads for Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos; Virginia even promised to help the company fight Freedom of Information Act requests.\n\nIt would be easy to assume that most of the objections to Amazon\u2019s HQ2 deal would come from the left. Senator Elizabeth Warren was, after all, one of the first politicians to criticize Amazon for monopolistic practices, arguing that the e-commerce giant and companies like it had eroded what was once a \u201cstrong, robust middle class.\u201d But disdain for corporate concentration is one of the rare things in contemporary American politics that transcends ideological divisions.\n\nTake Montana Senator Jon Tester, one of only two Democrats in the Senate to be reelected in a blood red state. Last year, he attacked the secretary of agriculture, complaining that meatpackers continue to \u201cexploit farmers and ranchers\u201d by manipulating the price they pay for livestock. Even corporate-friendly Democrats can sound downright populist on the subject. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a former venture capitalist who made his $200 million fortune off early cell phone technology, has emerged as a leading critic of the tech giants, noting how they kill competition and threaten national security.\n\nOpposition to monopoly also brings the left and the center together with unlikely allies. Perhaps the most power\u00adful critique of corporate concentration in recent months has come from The Economist, which has attacked the American antitrust establishment for laxness. And when Ocasio-Cortez spoke out against the Amazon deal, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board and the National Review both praised her. \u201cI hate to admit it, but Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has a very good point,\u201d said Fox News\u2019s Tucker Carlson. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to argue with the internal logic.... The richest man in the world just got $2 billion in taxpayer subsidies. How does that work?\u201d"

Trump argued that his prodigious wealth made him incorruptible, empowering him to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d The truth turned out to be quite the opposite, of course, but it was an effective campaign message against an established political force like Clinton.\n\nBut Warren tied her anti-corruption message to Democratic talking points on progressive issues. \u201cHow did we get here?\u201d she asks at one point. \u201cBillionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie, and they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice. They crippled unions so no one could stop them, dismantled the financial rules meant to keep us safe after the Great Depression, and cut their own taxes so they paid less than their secretaries and janitors.\u201d\n\nWarren isn\u2019t the first Democratic candidate to rail against insurance companies or fossil fuels. Her pitch, however, is that what ails modern American democracy is not just about policy, but power. \u201cThe whole scam is propped up by an echo chamber of fear and hate designed to distract and divide us,\u201d she says over footage of Fox News personalities like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson, as well as Trump officials like Stephen Miller. \u201cPeople who will do or say anything to hang onto power point the finger at anyone who looks, thinks, prays, or loves differently than they do.\u201d\n\nFor two years, Democrats have debated how best to confront Trump. Should they highlight relatively esoteric matters, like his potential violations of the Emoluments Clause? How much weight should the Russia investigation\u2014and Trump\u2019s campaign to hinder it\u2014receive? Should more attention be given to meat-and-potatoes policy issues like healthcare and economic growth? Warren answers with a broad brush, essentially casting the modern Republican Party as an outgrowth and a contributor of the self-dealing forces that elevated Trump to the presidency.\n\nIn a New York magazine profile in July, Warren said that opposing corruption \u201cis becoming a much more defining part of my work.\u201d The next month, she introduced the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act, a sprawling bill that would impose new lobbying requirements, rewrite campaign finance rules, and tackle a wide range of other good-government reforms. In her speech announcing the bill, Warren argued that corruption was not just a by-product of Trump\u2019s rise, but enabled by it as well."

    "text": "Mexico, for all the catastrophizing by politicians, the media, and NGO researchers, remains a country in flux rather than crisis. Its violent crime rate, while the source of horrific massacres and mass disappearances, is lower than those of Venezuela, Brazil, or Colombia. Its burgeoning high-tech and manufacturing sectors are the most productive and innovative in Latin America. And its current economic performance\u2014relatively low, if consistent, growth\u2014while disappointing to many, can be considered an improvement on the 20th century when Mexico lurched from crisis to crisis, depending on oil prices.\n\nUltimately, where Mexico continues to struggle is in the consolidation of democratic institutions and the rule of law\u2014the legacy of decades of authoritarianism. Weak public institutions undermine everything from criminal justice to the implementation of social welfare policy and prevent any government, right or left, from meeting its goals. They permit corruption to continue, and serve as background to the catastrophic images of death and mayhem that flit across our screens after the latest drug war massacre.\n\nMany in western academia and journalism continue to consider neoliberalism the region\u2019s primary problem.\n\nYet this is generally not the discussion being had on the left with regards to Latin America. Many in western academia and journalism continue to consider neoliberalism the region\u2019s primary problem. This posture was first adopted by the left in the 1990s during the alter-globalization movement, itself partly inspired by Mexico\u2019s 1994 \u201cZapatista\u201d uprising, and has endured as the foremost leftist critique of Latin American governments to this day. While many of the criticisms of the rapid implementation of liberalizing market policies were justified, they rarely appreciated the context of the times or distinguished between positive reforms and negative ones.\n\nMexico\u2019s market reforms, after all, were spurred by serious problems. While the Mexican economy, propelled by oil revenues, grew rapidly during the mid-20th century, state-backed monopolies filled with political cronies only served to suppress innovation and entrepreneurship, while state intervention in the economy through land reform and price controls simply maintained one-party hegemony, culminating in the disastrous Latin American Debt Crisis of 1982. Notably, Mexico today is growing more robustly in its north, which has been quicker to embrace industrialization and global trade, than its rural and politically volatile south, which only seems to fall further back.\n\nAMLO\u2019s policy proposals are not so much radical or innovative as retro. Steeped in nationalist symbolism, his economic plans in particular echo the country\u2019s leftist leaders of the 1970s, whose profligate spending contributed to the 1982 debt crisis. Specifically, he has suggested considerable public reinvestment in Mexico\u2019s corrupt, unwieldy energy giant, Pemex, implicated in the region-wide Odebrecht scandal; a revival of the agricultural sector, which was in steep decline even before the market reforms; and increased public spending. After decades of financing development via oil revenues and foreign loans, such increased spending cannot now occur sustainably without tax reform\u2014something AMLO so far has resisted."

    "text": "Tensions were further inflamed as Conservative politicians were photographed smiling at food banks, a \u201cphoto opportunity\u201d Corbyn quickly denounced during the weekly Prime Minister\u2019s Questions. The Trussell Trust, a charitable organization of over 420 food banks across the UK, has warned of unprecedented projected levels of usage leading up to Christmas.\n\nOne of the culprits behind this increase, the UN report and Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn argue, is Universal Credit, a reform spearheaded by the Conservative Party that was meant to simplify the welfare system by streamlining multiple benefits into one monthly payment. Announced in 2010 at the Conservative Party Conference, UC, as it is informally known, began to be introduced in 2013 and was supposed to be rolled out across the U.K. by 2017. It has yet to be fully implemented and has been plagued by IT failures and accusations of management problems. In a letter to the Guardian in October, heads of multiple poverty and homeless organizations wrote that \u201cone in five claims to universal credit currently fail because claimants find the process too complex,\u201d leaving impoverished households \u201cwithout essential support.\u201d The combined payment also takes five weeks between people successfully filing a claim and when they actually receive benefits, with some reports of delays as long as twelve weeks. Labour member of Parliament Frank Field said in October that the delay had driven some of his female constituents to sex work.\n\nFood banks have reported a fourfold increase in visitors, and a 52 percent increase in the number of three-day emergency food packages distributed, in areas where Universal Credit has been in place for 12 months or more, the Trussell Trust reported in April. Again, the wait time is the suspected culprit. \u201cThat is an awfully long time to wait, during which time many clients have been thrown into crisis, unable to afford a food shop and forced to come to the food bank,\u201d Alice Clifford, who volunteers at a London food bank, told me. The UN rapporteur similarly blamed the delay, writing that it \u201cpushes many who may already be in crisis into debt, rent arrears, and serious hardship, requiring them to sacrifice food or heat.\u201d\n\nHomelessness, meanwhile, is on a disturbing rise. Statistics released this month reveal that there are currently more than 120,000 children in temporary homes including bed and breakfast rooms and hostels\u2014a twelve-year high. The charity Shelter put the number of homeless in Britain at 320,000 this year\u2014an increase of 4 percent from the previous year. Official figures suggest that between 2010 and 2017 there was a 169 percent rise in homelessness.\n\nThe decisions forced by such rising numbers can be devastating. \u201cBecause resources are so scarce it turns council workers into \u2018guardians\u2019 of a very limited \u2018pot of gold,\u2019\u201d Edward, a London social worker, told me. \u201cSo instead of being agents who are there to help people, they become people who have to guard against people who don\u2019t deserve it enough: It\u2019s soul destroying.\u201d He compared it to the Victorian notion of the \u201cdeserving\u201d and \u201cundeserving\u201d poor, portrayed in Dickens\u2019s novels through characters such as Bob Cratchit in A Christmas Carol\u2014decent and hard working, as compared to Bill Sikes, the villain in Oliver Twist. \u201cYou find yourself, without even realizing it, considering who deserves your help the most,\u201d Edward said."

    "text": "Earlier this year, amid \u201cinternal divisions\u201d in the party, Pelosi signaled her intention to put pay-go into the rules package. \u201cDemocrats are committed to pay-as-you-go,\u201d her spokesman, Drew Hammill, said in June. Former Progressive Caucus chair Ra\u00fal Grijalva (D-AZ) responded by calling pay-go \u201can absurd idea,\u201d saying it\u2019s \u201cirresponsible to try to tie up Congress\u2019s ability to respond to economic downturns or, in the current discussion, to slash programs.\u201d\n\nPelosi has defended and expanded pay-go for over a decade. She first instituted it as a standing rule the day she received the speaker\u2019s gavel in 2007, and was a driving force in passing the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act in 2010, signed by Barack Obama. That law puts the burden on the president to enforce across-the-board cuts if Congress violates pay-go. The prospect of any president implementing an unpopular hatchet job like that is remote. So the House rule looms large in this fight by constraining new spending at its source.\n\nObviously, Pelosi and her allies on pay-go consider the rule good politics, allowing them to rebut charges about \u201ctax and spend\u201d liberals by insisting that every new program is fully paid for. If anybody actually cared about the deficit, instead of habitually using it as a weapon to rein in the opposition party, maybe that logic would be compelling. But even if the politics make sense, the rule leads to bad policy, as Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute, which is quite close to House progressives, argues in a paper last week.\n\nAs Bivens explains, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s subsidies were artificially made smaller because of pay-go rules. Democrats also created a long implementation period for Obamacare, with four years between signing and the effective date of the exchanges. That allowed adherence to pay-go within the ten-year budget window. But it also denied benefits to the public for an exceedingly long period, during which Republicans swept into virtually all levels of government.\n\nA pay-go rule is even more dangerous in a time of economic downturn, when government needs to be the spender of last resort. \u201cIt is terrible economics to view federal budget deficits as always and everywhere bad,\u201d Bivens writes, and that\u2019s especially true when the economy is struggling. Democrats, he notes, were obsessed with President George W. Bush \u201crunning up the nation\u2019s credit card\u201d on wars and tax cuts when the real focus should have been on deregulation that was weakening financial markets."

    "text": "Hinton also pushed Presbyterian to acquire physicians. Outside doctors had long brought their sickest patients to his hospitals, which essentially served as workshops where they drew on the intensive care services only hospitals can provide. But as new regulations made it more onerous for clinicians to run their own small private practices, Presbyterian offered to make them permanent employees\u2014strong-arming them to accept, if necessary\n\nAllyson Ray, an ear, nose, and throat doctor in private practice in Albuquerque, had treated Presbyterian-insured patients for years when the health plan abruptly cut its reimbursements for her services. When she and colleagues grouped together to negotiate, she said Presbyterian informed them it would rather pay higher prices to send patients for treatment out-of-state than compromise with them. The incident added to New Mexico\u2019s perennial shortage of specialist physicians: rather than endure the confrontation, Ray recalled, one of the doctors left the state and another retired early.\n\nPresbyterian also restricted the technologies clinicians could use in the hospital without their input about how it might affect outcomes. \u201cFrom my viewpoint it was mostly for the benefit to build their business,\u201d Ray said, \u201cand they didn\u2019t seem to show any concern for quality of care.\u201d\n\nGeneral surgeon Robert Milne said that when he left private practice for a job at Presbyterian in 2003, it didn\u2019t immediately affect the care he delivered; he was able to refer patients to doctors he trusted, whether or not they, too, were Presbyterian employees. But then things began to change: \u201cThat was discouraged,\u201d he said, and over time, \u201cthey became more insistent.\u201d While it would seem logical for an insurer to seek out the best services at the lowest cost, Presbyterian preferred dealing back to its own staff. As another doctor put it to me, they didn\u2019t care what they paid; they care who they paid.\n\nIn a history of Presbyterian issued on its centennial, Hinton said such criticisms were a misreading of the events. \u201cI think independent specialty physicians saw that Presbyterian and the health plan were growing and may have felt that we would use our size to their detriment. Well, that was never our intent.\u201d Whatever the intent, the number of physicians employed by the system has swelled \u2014 from 42 in 1995 up to over 650 today.\n\nWith 11,000 total staff, Presbyterian is now the largest private employer in the state, and it insures one in three New Mexicans. As Larry Stroup, who was chairman of the board when it named Hinton CEO, told me recently, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have that level of understanding and appreciation of Presbyterian, if I was on the other side of the competitive environment in Albuquerque, I would claim that it is an unbalanced market.\u201d\n\nLeading a tour of the Cancer Center, Barbara McAneny strides the corridors with easy command. The word most people settle on to describe her is \u201ctough.\u201d (In her speech on taking the reins of the American Medical Association, she quoted Sylvia Plath: \u201cI don\u2019t believe the meek will inherit the earth; The meek get trampled and ignored.\u201d) Little escapes her. Ducking into an empty exam room, her gaze quickly settles on a scuff mark behind the door where a chair has rubbed against it, and she frowns. An avid gardener, she points out a spot through a window where she\u2019d planted rose bushes in the dry desert earth\u2014until she realized the only people enjoying the flowers were those who stepped outside to smoke, and she paved it over to make more clinical space.\n\nThis site was nothing but dirt when McAneny first private practice in 1983, the same year Hinton took his first job at Presbyterian. A few years later, she teamed up with a fellow oncologist, Clark Haskins, and their group quickly earned a reputation for providing excellent care, traveling to the peripheries of the state to bring services closer to rural patients. At that time, it was difficult to treat most cancers in outpatient settings, so the partners referred them to the city\u2019s hospitals and cared for them there. As Haskins recalled, \u201cShe and I were #1 and #2, as far as admitting patients at Presbyterian and St. Joseph\u2019s hospitals, for several years.\u201d\n\nMcAneny and Haskins made a series of canny decisions to build their own business, and soon, they weren\u2019t just cooperating with Presbyterian, they were competing with it. New anti-nausea drugs had recently hit the market, which allowed a growing share of cancer patients to be treated in their own doctor\u2019s office, rather than a hospital, so McAneny and Haskins gradually referred fewer patients to Presbyterian. In 2002, they opened their New Mexico Cancer Center to provide outpatient care with an extensive array of ancillary services. On the walk-through today, McAneny points out the CT scanner and linear accelerator with evident pride, explaining that having these costly apparatuses on-site means a patient who comes in anxious about an unidentified growth can get immediate answers.\n\nThe Cancer Center will earn a healthy profit from those evaluations, but its most lucrative revenue stream comes from selling drugs. Typically, doctors prescribe medications that are then sold by pharmacists, but oncologists operate in a different way: They are allowed to both prescribe chemotherapy drugs and sell them, earning a share of the drugs\u2019 price, which is often considerable (according to the Community Oncology Alliance, a single doctor may prescribe $5 to $6 million of drugs annually).\n\nThis arrangement has made private oncology practices tempting targets for acquisition, and federal policies give hospitals further reason to gobble them up. Presbyterian and thousands of other hospitals that are eligible for what is known as the 340B program can buy drugs from the manufacturer at a 23 percent discount\u2014 and when they dispense them, they can tack on additional \u2018facility fees.\u2019 This means that merely purchasing an outpatient facility and designating it as \u2018hospital-based\u2019 can vastly increase its revenues\u2014with no change to its operations. And higher revenues are what justify the sky-high salaries of administrators who run these ostensibly nonprofit organizations: tax records show that Jim Hinton received $9.8 million between 2013 and 2016, making him among the highest-paid people in New Mexico.\n\nThese trends can be seen across the country, as oncology practices are swallowed up at a rapid pace. A 2018 study in Health Affairs found that 54 percent were integrated into hospitals or health systems in 2017, up from 20 percent in 2007. (There is debate about the degree to which the 340B program has driven the integration but a 2018 study in The New England Journal of Medicine found more than double the number of oncologists working in hospitals eligible for the program than in those that were ineligible.) And this explains why, shortly after the Cancer Center opened, Presbyterian allegedly began taking actions to acquire it.\n\nMcAneny said that at first, Presbyterian plied her group with offers to hire them. But, leery of the loss of autonomy they had seen other doctors experience on becoming employees of the health system, she and her colleagues demanded a degree of control that Presbyterian wasn\u2019t willing to concede. Then, McAneny alleged, Presbyterian tried to run them out of business.\n\nIn the lawsuit she and her partners filed in June 2012, they claim the Presbyterian health system directed its physicians to cease referring patients to the Cancer Center. The doctors had a contract with Presbyterian\u2019s health plan that allowed them to treat the patients it insured, but in the complaint, they allege that the health system threatened to terminate that agreement. Presbyterian also allegedly told patients that, to be reimbursed for care they received at the Cancer Center, they would have to fill their prescriptions for chemotherapy drugs at the hospital\u2019s pharmacy, which would have undercut the Cancer Center\u2019s main revenue stream.\n\nJason Mitchell, the Chief Medical Officer of Presbyterian, declined to comment on the lawsuit but maintained that the health system had no problem working with private practitioners in the community. \u201cWe\u2019re very collaborative,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s critical that we maintain our community providers and their practice.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no consensus about whether cancer patients treated by a hospital fare better than those treated by independent physicians, but it\u2019s clear that they pay more. A 2017 study found that cancer patients with commercial insurance who were treated in hospital outpatient settings paid prices that were 50 percent higher than those treated in doctors\u2019 offices. And a 2018 study in The Journal of Health Economics found that the price of physicians\u2019 services rose 14 percent after they were acquired by hospitals. Barak Richman, a professor of law at Duke University, said this is typical of how the way we bill for health care can distort the way it is delivered. \u201cWe encourage treatment in the wrong places: places that are incapable of giving higher-quality care and are wildly capable of imposing higher costs.\u201d\n\nAccording to McAneny and her colleagues, Presbyterian\u2019s predations are rooted in its monopoly power, and the only true solution is to break it into its constituent pieces. \u201cI want to take them apart,\u201d McAneny said. \u201cI want the hospital to go back to being a hospital. I want the health plan to go back to being a health plan. So every physician\u2014whether independent or Presbyterian\u2014can compete on quality and cost and not on who signs their name on the paycheck.\u201d\n\nBut while the Federal Trade Commission has been relatively active in challenging \u201chorizontal\u201d mergers that consolidate similar businesses (when one hospital system acquires another, for example), they rarely intercede to block \u201cvertical\u201d mergers between different business types (as in the case of Presbyterian, which fuses doctors, hospitals, and insurance). \u201cI don\u2019t think that all of healthcare needs to be done by these large vertically-integrated institutions,\u201d McAneny said. \u201cI\u2019m coming to the conclusion that there\u2019s a right size for healthcare that varies based on your community.\u201d Were the courts to rule in her favor, it might draw public attention to this position, and ultimately push regulators to take more aggressive action.\n\nTo be sure, it is impossible to ignore the financial interests that McAneny and her colleagues have in the outcome of the case. While they may be fighting for changes they believe will reduce the public\u2019s health care expenses, the viability of their own business also hinges on the outcome. And there\u2019s something personal at stake, too. McAneny and doctors of her generation mourn a culture of medicine they see slipping from their grasp: as health systems have expanded and grown more reliant on data to make clinical decisions, care has become fragmented across ever-wider teams and doctors have lost some of their centrality. McAneny can\u2019t hide her disdain for the hospital administrators who have gained authority as a result; she described their main duties as \u201cmaking sure there are meals provided to patients and the floors get cleaned.\u201d David Stryker, an infectious disease doctor in private practice who has contracted with Presbyterian and served on one of its boards for over a decade, put it succinctly: \u201cWhen I started practice, the hospitals were there to help me take care of my patients. Now, I\u2019m there to help the hospital serve their customers.\u201d\n\nA single lawsuit is unlikely to turn back the tide. In a preliminary decision in 2014, a federal judge found that the Cancer Center made a plausible antitrust claim and allowed the case to move forward to discovery; they now await a trial date. But even if the District Court ultimately rules in the doctors\u2019 favor, there is a limit to how much that will achieve. Health systems across the country are growing ever more concentrated, dominant in their own marketplaces and with economic weight to move markets in neighboring ones. Reversing these trends would almost certainly require regulators invigorated to push back hard against them, and legislators willing to dismantle the federal policies that promote consolidation in the first place.\n\nOr perhaps the concentration will reach a point that it spurs policymaker to adopt an even more radical fix. \u201cI have personally been a diehard conservative most of my life,\u201d said Bill Fitzpatrick, a former Chief Medical Officer of Presbyterian, \u201cbut Bernie Sanders may have it right: we may need a single payer system.\u201d In today\u2019s fragmented health care marketplace, with competition mostly limited to behind-the-scenes negotiations between huge payers and providers, rent-seeking behavior is rife. Though costly, a sole public insurer might eliminate the worst of these inefficiencies.\n\nWhile the parties to the lawsuit await trial, Presbyterian has continued its expansion unabated. In September, it opened a $145 million hospital an hour up the highway in Santa Fe, which many see as unneeded additional infrastructure but the requisite toehold for entering that new market. \u201cI can already see the wars coming up there in terms of who is going to have the medical doctors and who is going to have the patients,\u201d Fitzpatrick said.\n\nBut it is no longer on the watch of Jim Hinton, who finally left New Mexico in 2017 to head Baylor Scott & White Health in neighboring Texas, with about five times the annual revenue of Presbyterian. Few of his old peers were surprised when in October 2018, he announced the acquisition of the neighboring Memorial Hermann Health System, to create a sprawling network of 68 hospitals."

    "text": "Around this time four years ago, before the presidential primaries had begun, the most plausible Republican candidates seemed to be reading from more or less the same script. There were differences, to be sure, between Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Jeb Bush, but for the most part, they offered a mixture of social conservatism, budgetary austerity, and neoconservative foreign policy. Even as the field dwindled, Cruz, Rubio, and the supposedly moderate John Kasich\u2014the last mainstream candidates left standing\u2014all supported slashing Social Security and Medicare to make room for large income tax reductions. They were cut from recognizable GOP cloth, if tailored to slightly different tastes.\n\nDonald Trump, meanwhile, was different, and not just in the color of his hair and the length of his ties. While all the other Republicans were converging around the policy positions of Paul Ryan, Trump identified a section of potential GOP voters who were being overlooked. It was to them that he directed his startlingly new positions on trade, immigration, foreign policy, and entitlements; for them that he promised to protect Medicare and Social Security; and for them, that he proposed a noninterventionist, what\u2019s-in-it-for-us foreign policy, and pledged to end free trade agreements.\n\nThe majority of GOP voters\u2014as much as 60 percent\u2014didn\u2019t particularly like these positions. (And GOP funders, especially those in the Koch network, saw his policy positions as an outright repudiation of their core ideological commitments.) The ordinary Republican candidates\u2014the 16 not named Donald Trump\u2014knew as much. But in fighting for the \u201cnormal\u201d 60 percent of the Republican electorate, they ensured their own defeat. In Illinois, the three conventional Republicans (Cruz, Rubio, and Kasich) took 59 percent of the vote, but because it was split three ways, not one was able to top Trump\u2019s 39 percent. The same thing happened in North Carolina, where voters gave the orthodox candidates 58 percent, and Trump took the state with 40. The strategy may not have been intentional, but it turned out to be foolproof: Carve out a distinct political ideology that appeals to a solid minority of primary voters, and let the rest of the candidates vie for, and consequently split, the rest of the vote.\n\nMore than a dozen candidates may run for the Democratic nomination in 2020: governors from the Plains states, senators from the coasts, billionaire entrepreneurs. But the most serious so far\u2014Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Bernie Sanders\u2014run the risk of falling into the same trap as the main Republicans did in 2015. All of them\u2014even the previously ideologically flexible Cory Booker\u2014are competing for the same section of the primary electorate, one that wants to trade in centrist triangulation for social democratic economics. Given the repeated failures of deregulation, fiscal conservatism, and crony capitalism, this is an understandable instinct. Any one of these candidates could win the nomination if he or she were the only one in the mix. But there are (at least) four or five of them, all clustered around the same positions; come next summer, they will be fighting for the same voters, and as a result, they could all lose. It\u2019s the same bad math that afflicted Cruz, Kasich, and Rubio four years ago, only now it\u2019s on the other side."

    "text": "The French, with their penchant for putting a twist on Anglicisms, have lately become fond of the phrase parler cash, which means to speak bluntly. Marine Le Pen parle cash: \u201cThe emperor has no clothes,\u201d she mocked amidst the Yellow Vest unrest. \u201cWhen Macron was a candidate, they told us he was a professional, an expert in economics, rigorous to a fault.\u2026 In fact, he\u2019s a total amateur, totally unprepared, and totally indecisive.\u201d\n\nSuch is Le Pen\u2019s revenge. In the televised debate between the first and second rounds of the presidential election, Macron demolished his opponent\u2019s confused efforts to explain how she would withdraw France from the euro, as she had threatened, while continuing to participate in a \u201ccommon currency\u201d\u2014the fallback position to which she had retreated when it became apparent in the closing weeks of the campaign that abandoning the euro was an unpopular option. Le Pen became lost in her notes and flailed, trying to parry Macron\u2019s professorial interrogation. Now, Macron finds his policies under relentless interrogation by the Yellow Vests, and Le Pen has been liberated to dismiss as a feckless amateur the \u201cprofessor\u201d who previously humiliated her.\n\nHow can Macron respond? Macronism always rested on the assumption that France\u2019s problems stemmed from being out of step with its European partners. Writing anonymously in Slate\u2019s French edition, a high civil servant at home with Macron\u2019s technocratic idiom put it this way: The driving force behind Macronism is \u201cthe feeling that France\u2019s situation is abnormal, especially in regard to the [very high] level of public spending and social protection.\u201d The implicit bargain was that Macron would change France to look more like its European partners; in return, Europe would assume national security and economic regulatory functions that the nation-state could no longer fulfill. But Macron has always been careful to say that he favored not just any Europe but only l\u2019Europe qui prot\u00e8ge, the Europe that protects. He has accordingly tried to cast himself as a \u201cprogressive,\u201d whereas opponents such as Le Pen and Italian vice-premier Matteo Salvini were \u201cnationalists.\u201d\n\nBut so far, the European Union has not taken Macron up on his invitation to position itself as a protector rather than an enforcer, and rhetorical divisions between the French and other Europeans seem to be growing. European leaders I\u2019ve spoken to seem to see the recent uprising as confirmation of Macron\u2019s own description of his countrymen as \u201cGauls resistant to change.\u201d Macron, meanwhile, has given some ground to the nationalists, saying that one source of the rebels\u2019 anger is their \u201cfear\u201d of \u201can ultraliberal [in the sense of \u201cultracapitalist\u201d] Europe that no longer allows the middle class to live decently\u201d\u2014a rather damning accusation from a man who normally presents himself as a staunch defender of both the European Union and global capitalism. Meanwhile, a temporary respite has set in. The number of demonstrators in the so-called Act Six of the uprising was down sharply, and the emergence of an overtly anti-Semitic element among the protesters has damaged the movement\u2019s image.\n\nPierre Person, a Macron aide involved in planning the strategy for the May 2019 European parliamentary elections, says that success will hinge on his party\u2019s ability to make Europe\u2019s protective function credible to voters whose fears the president so accurately described. It is hard to see how this can work: France\u2019s European partners, already wary of Macron\u2019s reforms, are now so resistant that when the European Council met in mid-December, Macron\u2019s proposal for increasing the EU budget was dismissed with a one-sentence statement deferring further consideration until next fall. Macron may be willing to consider angry Yellow Vest voices. But in Europe\u2019s high councils, the only acceptable\u2014or salonf\u00e4hig, to borrow the German term that literally means \u201cacceptable in the drawing room\u201d\u2014language remains that of the technocrats, who continue to insist that one model fits all and no change is required. Astonishingly, the unrest in France has thus far elicited little acknowledgment from Brussels of the need for change in EU governance practices. If President Macron is to win his battle with the populists, he will need allies, yet the EU, having papered over its differences with the populist government in Italy, seems content to pretend that it can continue on its charted course despite the prospect of still more severe turbulence ahead."

    "text": "Buried within the more than 500 pages of Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cut was an unobtrusive line item with potentially damaging consequences. Proposed by Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the provision allows governors to select certain census tracts in their states, in economically distressed areas, as \u201copportunity zones.\u201d The Treasury certified the last of these zones in June, bringing the total number to 8,700. Now, investors who fund projects in these areas will get sizable tax breaks\u2014even on unrelated investments. As long as they dump profits into a fund earmarked for the opportunity zones, they can defer or even eliminate the capital gains they would otherwise have owed.\n\nSome of the census tracts that have been identified as opportunity zones may be truly distressed. But it\u2019s dubious whether others should qualify\u2014this summer, for example, much of Long Island City in New York was named an opportunity zone. Now that Amazon has announced it\u2019s moving one of its two HQ2 branches there, the retail behemoth could nab a $225 million tax break simply because the site happens to fall in one such zone\u2014this, on top of the $1.7 billion New York has already offered Amazon. Investors who purchase apartment buildings for the influx of tech employees will also see tax breaks. So will anyone building office parks, or grocery stores. That money may well be better spent elsewhere, but during the debate over the tax bill, such questions received very little attention. Neither, really, did the zones themselves. Since its passage, though, President Donald Trump has enthusiastically promoted the plan, issuing press releases boasting that \u201cnew investment will flow into blighted developments, stalled infrastructure projects, and other desperately needed economic enhancements\u201d and create fiscal improvements that will \u201chelp turn dreams to reality.\u201d\n\nThe thinking behind the zones reflects Republican faith in privatization as a cure-all. If Trump has departed from conservative orthodoxy on trade and entitlements, he is squarely with the party when it comes to this issue. On the campaign trail, he promised to spend $1.5 trillion on the country\u2019s infrastructure, but when the details of his plan were released a month before the election, it was merely a proposal to privatize roads, bridges, and waterways. Trump has similar plans for the nation\u2019s air traffic control system, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and even the Postal Service. Each one offers huge upsides for a select group of financiers and business owners, but does little to nothing for the American people.\n\nNone of these promises has fully gone into law\u2014apart from opportunity zones, the first of which the Treasury implemented this spring. Since then, a number of funds have cropped up to cash in on the boom. Anthony Scaramucci, who served as Trump\u2019s director of communications for all of ten days, plans to launch a $3 billion \u201copportunity fund\u201d at his hedge fund Skybridge Capital. Cadre, the real estate crowdfunding platform partially owned by Jared Kushner and his brother, Joshua, is also focused on exploiting the zones. As Charles Clinton, the CEO of EquityMultiple, a real estate investment startup, said in September, they are \u201cone of the biggest real estate investment opportunities in decades.\u201d\n\n"

    "text": "Other revisions have gone in the opposite way. Creators I dismissed when younger like Vladimir Nabokov (\u201ca fancy-pants show-off,\u201d I once thought) or Stanley Kubrick (\u201ccold, sterile, boring\u201d) are now among my favorites. I would like to think there\u2019s a process of maturing at work!\n\nIn fact, I know that aging has definitely helped me revise my opinion of one writer. When I first dipped into the novels of Anthony Powell a few decades ago, he seemed to me a fussily minor snob, sharing Waugh\u2019s upper-class milieu but without Waugh\u2019s ferocious comic cruelty. This summer, I read Perry Anderson\u2019s epic review of a new Powell biography in The London Review of Books, which basically argued at great length (two parts! 28,000 words!) that Powell was better than Marcel Proust.\n\nThis seemed so far-fetched and outside my experience of reading both Powell and Proust that I had to test it out. I went to my local university library to take out the twelve volumes of Powell\u2019s A Dance to the Music of Time (published from 1951 to 1975). As it turned out, these dusty volumes didn\u2019t have bar codes, just catalogue cards that were blank. I was the first person ever to take these books out from that library.\n\nAs I made my way through the novels, I found I liked them much more than my earlier, more cursory readings. The Dance cycle is a roman-fleuve (a snooty way of saying \u201csoap opera\u201d) spanning five decades (roughly from 1914 to the early 1970s). The narrator Nick Jenkins tells about the people who have come in and out of his life over those years, with once tight school chums becoming distant, new friends and lovers made and unmade, and the surprising turns that people take (with once mocked figures becoming successes or staid figures turning out to have kinky sexualities).\n\nReading it this time, it occurred to me that the Dance novels really capture what it\u2019s like to be middle-aged, to have lived long enough to have gone through the ups and downs of relationships and seen the twisty turns that mark every life\u2019s arc. And what once seemed vices in Powell could be reevaluated as virtues: His fussiness was also a passion for precision in delineating what is exactly knowable about other people; his snobbery was also a sensitivity to the gradations of social milieu; his chilly dispassion also a necessary part of his anthropological curiosity about human oddness. It\u2019s not surprising that I\u2019m much fonder of Powell now than I was in my twenties.\n\nSo that\u2019s one part of how critics change, and perhaps there should be age recommendation for books: no Harlan Ellison after 16, no Anthony Powell before 45.\n\nLivingstone: You\u2019re bang on there; a reader and a writer must meet at just the right time for real chemistry to take place. You mentioned Waugh, whom I loved as a teenager, but only really because E.M. Forster had appealed to me so deeply. It was a logic all my own. I wasn\u2019t mature enough to be put off by Waugh\u2019s aristocratic themes, so I lumped him in with all the other authors I credited with warming my cold English heart: Forster, D.H. Lawrence, Henry James, Ford Madox Ford, L. P. Hartley.\n\nYou just observed that Powell\u2019s Dance novels captured something of what it means to be middle-aged. By the same token, I put together a personal canon in my younger years, because they all represented something that I needed. None of those books reflected my experience, exactly, but they had a collective meaning that together shaped my life. But that canon has expired; I no longer get the same thing out of Waugh that I once did. I\u2019m \u201cover it,\u201d if you will.\n\nI no longer get the same thing out of Waugh that I once did. I\u2019m \u201cover it,\u201d if you will.\n\nBut let\u2019s get back to the critic specifically. We\u2019ve established that readers and writers change over time, so there must be an important relation between the artwork and time, age, biography, and ultimately interpretation. If that\u2019s so important, as I think we both agree it is, then how can a critic go about their career without acknowledging that relation? We seem to be getting at an ethical question and an aesthetic one at the same time...\n\nHeer: Yes, I think changing opinions does carry with it an ethical obligation: You have to be honest about how and why you\u2019ve come to your new opinions. One thing that annoys me is when critics fail to be upfront when they change their mind. Consider the husband and wife duo of F.R. and Queenie Leavis. In their early work, the Leavises were very condescending toward Dickens. In her Fiction and the Reading Public (1939) Queenie wrote, \u201cDickens stands primarily for a set of crude emotional exercises. He discovered ... the formula laughter and tears\u2019 that has been the foundation of practically every popular success ever since (Hollywood\u2019s as well as the bestseller\u2019s).\u201d\n\nIn his book The Great Tradition (1948), F.R. Leavis pointedly left out Dickens from his canonical list of the great English novelists (a tight little clubhouse that only had room for Jane Austen, George Eliot, Henry James, Joseph Conrad, and D.H. Lawrence). Dickens, F.R. Leavis admitted, had \u201cgenius\u201d but it was \u201cthe genius of a great entertainer.\u201d Further, \u201cthe adult mind,\u201d according to the critic, \u201cdoesn\u2019t as a rule find in Dickens a challenge to an unusual and sustained seriousness.\u201d In 1970, the Leavises (the Leavi?) ...\n\nLivingstone: Leavises.\n\nHeer: ... collaborated on a book called Dickens the Novelist where they had the chutzpah to berate fellow critics for not appreciating that Dickens was one of the greatest writers who ever lived, the peer of Shakespeare and Tolstoy. In the preface of the book they set out their agenda: \u201cWe should like to make it impossible ... for any intellectual\u2014academic, journalist or both\u2014to tell us with the familiar easy assurance that Dickens of course was a genius, but that his line was entertainment.\u201d They further denounced critics who were so foolish as to believe that \u201cDickens never grew up intellectually.\u201d (Decades earlier, Queenie Leavis had written that Dickens\u2019s \u201coriginality is confined to recapturing a child\u2019s outlook on the grown-up world.\u201d)\n\n\n\nDid the Leavises have a right to change their mind on Dickens? Sure, absolutely. But what makes Dickens the Novelist an intolerable book is that they don\u2019t ever acknowledge that their minds changed. They act as if they were right all along and other benighted critics held the views that they themselves propagated. The whole exercise amounts to a kind of critical Stalinism, a relentless whitewashing of their own past in order to uphold their authority.\n\nSo much of critical authority depends on confidence of opinion. To change your mind risks undermining that authority, an act of self-subversion. But I still think the better path is honesty.\n\nLivingstone: Critical Stalinism! Well, we don\u2019t want that. How does one approach this kind of honesty, in practice?\n\nHeer: Well, I think Susan Sontag provides a better model than the Leavises, but even she still had difficulty in reconciling her conflicting opinions.\n\nIn 1965, Sontag in her essay \u201cOn Style\u201d praised Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s The Triumph of the Will and The Olympiad, claiming \u201cthese two films of Riefenstahl (unique among works of Nazi artists) transcend the categories of propaganda or even reportage.... Through Riefenstahl\u2019s genius as a filmmaker, the \u2018content\u2019 has\u2014let us even assume, against her intentions\u2014come to play a purely formal role.\u201d In 1974, in an essay called \u201cFascinating Fascism,\u201d Sontag argued that The Triumph of the Will was \u201ca film whose very conception negates the possibility of the filmmaker\u2019s having an aesthetic conception independent of propaganda.\u2019\u2019\n\nMy contention is that, like Whitman, every good critic contains multitudes.\n\nOn the face of it, these two positions seem contradictory. Yet both essays were reprinted in A Susan Sontag Reader (1983). More importantly, in an interview (also in the Reader) Sontag doesn\u2019t disavow the first essay. Rather, the critic argued the two essays show \u201ca continuity, to be sure, in that both statements illustrate the richness of the form-content distinction, as long as one is careful always to use it against itself. My point in 1965 was about the formal implications of content, while the recent essay examines the content implicit in certain ideas of form.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I fully buy Sontag\u2019s attempt to paper over the contradiction. What I do admire, however, is that she shows that an engaged mind never settles down definitively before a work of art, but rather improvises competing responses. My contention is that, like Whitman, every good critic contains multitudes.\n\nLivingstone: The Sontag example is helpful, because her inconsistency\u2014let\u2019s call it internal heterodoxy?\u2014is such a core feature of her thought. She had little shame about flitting from position to position, but that flexibility helped her build a lot of bridges as she moved between essay-writing, reporting, fiction, and criticism.\n\n\u201cEvery good critic contains multitudes.\u201d Sure, that sounds good. But what about that other kind of critic\u2014the pure, blazing genius who will never admit that he\u2019s wrong in the moment, but continues instead to change, and change again, and in so doing forces culture forward like a very arrogant runaway train? I\u2019m thinking of Wittgenstein.\n\nOf course, he wasn\u2019t a critic. But Wittgenstein\u2019s work has long been divided into the early and the later parts of his career: his work up to and including the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, on logic and language and metaphysics, and the period that culminated in his Philosophical Investigations, which took aim at all philosophy that had gone before it, including Wittgenstein\u2019s own book. In his great transition period, Wittgenstein rejected all philosophical dogmatism, and totally changed the direction of his philosophy.\n\nWhat I am trying to point out is that Wittgenstein didn\u2019t announce his changes of mind as he went along. He worked with total commitment, but in phases. He didn\u2019t waste time apologizing for or retracting his early works. He is Sontag\u2019s opposite, in many ways. She was the ultimate brilliant dilettante, skipping across fields to deliver powerful, glancing blows. He dug a hole and sat in it. And yet they both were able to evolve.\n\nWhich of them was the more honest? I think it all boils down to whether you think the critic has to engage with society on an equal footing\u2014as more a friend to the reader, like Sontag\u2014or whether he can ignore the world and thereby ultimately give more of himself.\n\nHeer: I think the Wittgenstein/Sontag distinction is a useful one and might be related to their separate vocations. The philosopher is searching for truth and, in his or her more confident moments, tries to be the voice of truth. In articulating ultimate truths, a contradiction is a sign of failure. Conversely, the critic is a flightier creature, a flibbertigibbet whose changeability can be charming.\n\nIn 1933, Sidney Hook wrote one of the best books ever in the Marxist tradition, Towards the Understanding of Karl Marx: A Revolutionary Interpretation. But as his politics shifted from revolutionary to reformist socialism, Hook grew embarrassed by this book and resisted requests to reprint it. During the 1960s, a bootleg copy circulated in New Left circles. It was only after he died that his family, quite reluctantly, allowed a reprint. There were at least two Sidney Hooks, and the older one tried to censor his younger self. A shame, really, since the younger Sidney Hook was the more interesting of the two thinkers.\n\nThe Canadian philosopher Michael Allen Fox underwent a similar experience. In 1986, he published a book called The Case for Animal Experimentation, a book that was savaged by animal rights activists. As he read his hostile critics, Fox realized he had no good answer to their objections. \u201cThe more I read of my critics, the more I came to the conclusion that the difference between humans and animals is of degrees, not kind,\u201d Fox told me in 2001, when I interviewed him for an article I did for The National Post. Fox would later go on to write a book called Deep Vegetarianism (1999), which, spoiler alert, takes a more pro-animal approach than his earlier volume.\n\nWhen I interviewed Fox, I asked him how he would react to a request to publish his earlier book. \u201cI would probably say OK, but with the proviso that I be allowed to write an introduction explaining how my thinking has changed,\u201d he replied. \u201cIf the publisher said, \u2018no new introduction,\u2019 I would have a serious quandary. Even then, I would probably say, \u2018publish it\u2019. I don\u2019t support the suppression of research, even in the case of my own work.\u201d\n\nGood criticism and good philosophy have the quality that Yeats ascribes to poetry: They grow out of internal wrestling.\n\nI\u2019ve always like Yeats\u2019s aphorism that, \u201cOut of the quarrel with others we make rhetoric; out of the quarrel with ourselves we make poetry.\u201d But I would qualify it by saying that good criticism and good philosophy have the quality that Yeats ascribes to poetry: They grow out of internal wrestling.\n\nInternal strife is the true origins of changed opinion. I often have the experience when I\u2019m making an argument of trying to address not some external opponent but my own mixed feelings. For example, I recently wrote a piece arguing against gloating over the death of The Weekly Standard. I stand by the piece, but if I had wanted to, I could have easily written (with almost equal conviction), \u201cThe Weekly Standard was a harmful magazine. Good riddance to bad rubbish.\u201d I partly wrote the piece to settle the issue in my mind and to resolve contradictory emotions.\n\nFor deep insight into all this, I want to recommend to you (and to readers) Nicholson Baker\u2019s essay \u201cChanges of Mind\u201d (found in his 1996 collection The Size of Thought). Better than anything I\u2019ve read, this essay gets at the involuntary nature of these changes, the strange but true fact that our mind has a mind of its own.\n\n\u201cWe have no choice,\u201d Baker writes. \u201cOur opinions, gently nudged by circumstance, revise themselves under cover of inattention. We tell them, in a steady voice, No, I\u2019m not interested in a change at present. But there is no stopping opinions. They don\u2019t care about whether we want to hold them or not; they do what they have to do.\u201d\n\nLivingstone: Curse and bless you for bringing up Nicholson Baker. His book U & I has been haunting me. It\u2019s about John Updike, but written from Baker\u2019s memory of Updike, rather than according to normal research methods. It\u2019s such an inventive book, but it\u2019s also so anxious. It demonstrates several uncomfortable things at once: a) that the critic is only ever working from an incomplete understanding of an author\u2019s work, because we are trapped in our subjectivity as readers; b) that is a painful crux to work in; and c) it doesn\u2019t get any less painful even when you know what\u2019s happening.\n\nI\u2019ll turn to this essay now, \u201cChanges of Mind.\u201d From what you have described, it seems like a kinder theorization of the critical condition of incompleteness. A change of mind doesn\u2019t have to mean inconsistency or weakness; perhaps it\u2019s just a characteristic of our many-pronged, magical ability to care about other people\u2019s work."

Demonstrators characterized the PT era, which began thirteen years earlier with the presidency of former metalworker and union leader Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and admittedly had its fair share of scandals even as it lifted millions out of abject poverty, as an insidious plot to subvert the fabric of Brazilian society and align the nation with international pariahs like Iran and Venezuela.

    "text": "Anti-corruption is familiar ground for presidential candidates trying to position themselves as outsiders who will fix Washington. Trump argued that his prodigious wealth made him incorruptible, empowering him to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d The truth turned out to be quite the opposite, of course, but it was an effective campaign message against an established political force like Clinton.\n\nBut Warren tied her anti-corruption message to Democratic talking points on progressive issues. \u201cHow did we get here?\u201d she asks at one point. \u201cBillionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie, and they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice. They crippled unions so no one could stop them, dismantled the financial rules meant to keep us safe after the Great Depression, and cut their own taxes so they paid less than their secretaries and janitors.\u201d\n\nWarren isn\u2019t the first Democratic candidate to rail against insurance companies or fossil fuels. Her pitch, however, is that what ails modern American democracy is not just about policy, but power. \u201cThe whole scam is propped up by an echo chamber of fear and hate designed to distract and divide us,\u201d she says over footage of Fox News personalities like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson, as well as Trump officials like Stephen Miller. \u201cPeople who will do or say anything to hang onto power point the finger at anyone who looks, thinks, prays, or loves differently than they do.\u201d\n\nFor two years, Democrats have debated how best to confront Trump. Should they highlight relatively esoteric matters, like his potential violations of the Emoluments Clause? How much weight should the Russia investigation\u2014and Trump\u2019s campaign to hinder it\u2014receive? Should more attention be given to meat-and-potatoes policy issues like healthcare and economic growth? Warren answers with a broad brush, essentially casting the modern Republican Party as an outgrowth and a contributor of the self-dealing forces that elevated Trump to the presidency.\n\nIn a New York magazine profile in July, Warren said that opposing corruption \u201cis becoming a much more defining part of my work.\u201d The next month, she introduced the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act, a sprawling bill that would impose new lobbying requirements, rewrite campaign finance rules, and tackle a wide range of other good-government reforms. In her speech announcing the bill, Warren argued that corruption was not just a by-product of Trump\u2019s rise, but enabled by it as well."

    "text": "In other words, Americans can\u2019t give as much money to candidates as they may want, but candidates, parties, and outside groups can spend as much money as they can get. To uphold contribution limits, the court also recognized Congress\u2019 interest in tackling not just the existence of corruption, but the perception of it. \u201cOf almost equal concern as the danger of actual quid pro quo arrangements is the impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions,\u201d the justices wrote. They reasoned that those perceptions could be as corrosive to public faith in America\u2019s democratic institutions as the reality itself.\n\nStriking down expenditure limits had long-lasting effects. Perhaps the most significant of them was the rise of \u201csoft money,\u201d which refers to unlimited donations made to political parties that could then be spent in support of candidates. The practice effectively bypassed limits on how much money corporations, unions, and wealthy donors could spend on electioneering through both parties and outside groups. In 2002, Congress passed the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act to impose contribution limits on political parties themselves and extend some campaign-finance restrictions to outside groups. BCRA, also known as McCain-Feingold after the two senators who championed it, immediately faced legal challenges from its opponents.\n\nForemost among those opponents was Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell, a longtime foe of campaign-finance reform and the Senate\u2019s current majority leader. McConnell denounced BCRA during its passage as a \u201cstunningly stupid thing to do\u201d and filed a lawsuit against the FEC shortly after it was signed into law. The Supreme Court largely ruled against him in McConnell v. FEC in 2003. Sandra Day O\u2019Connor joined with the court\u2019s liberal wing to write most of the court\u2019s opinion, including its core rulings in favor of the soft-money ban for parties and on the electioneering limits for other outside groups. Court watchers noted that O\u2019Connor, the court\u2019s swing vote at the time, was also the only justice who had held elected office.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy, in dissent, argued that Congress could only impose restrictions on quid pro quo corruption\u2014in literal terms, cash for votes\u2014without violating the First Amendment. Anything short of that was an inevitable byproduct of citizens petitioning their representatives for policy preferences. \u201cDemocracy is premised on responsiveness,\u201d he argued. \u201cQuid pro quo corruption has been, until now, the only agreed upon conduct that represents the bad form of responsiveness and presents a justiciable standard with a relatively clear limiting principle: Bad responsiveness may be demonstrated by pointing to a relationship between an official and a quid.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, O\u2019Connor retired and President George W. Bush nominated Samuel Alito to replace her. With her departure, the other conservative justices put their more hostile approach towards campaign-finance restrictions into practice. In the 2010 case Citizens United v. FEC, the court overruled part of McConnell and all of Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, an earlier campaign-finance ruling, to strike down BCRA\u2019s restrictions on campaign spending by corporations, unions, and other outside groups. This time, Kennedy\u2019s constrained view of what counted as corruption carried the day.\n\n\u201cWhen Buckley identified a sufficiently important governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption, that interest was limited to quid pro quo corruption,\u201d Kennedy wrote for the court, narrowing the scope of the 1976 ruling. \u201cThe fact that speakers may have influence over or access to elected officials does not mean that these officials are corrupt.\u201d He added that \u201cthe appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy\u201d\u2014a prediction that has not fared well.\n\nJustice John Paul Stevens, writing for the dissenters, took issue with this myopic view of corruption. \u201cBribery may be the paradigm case,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut the difference between selling a vote and selling access is a matter of degree, not kind. And selling access is not qualitatively different from giving special preference to those who spent money on one\u2019s behalf.\u201d He cited Teachout\u2019s work to note that the Constitution\u2019s drafters also took a similarly broad view. \u201cWhen they brought out constitutional order into being, the Framers had their minds trained on a threat to republican self-government that this Court has lost sight of,\u201d he added.\n\nThe trend continues. In 2013, the court struck down BCRA\u2019s aggregate limits on campaign donations in McCutcheon v. FEC, freeing the nation\u2019s wealthiest citizens to spend as much money as they would like on as many candidates as they would like, so long as they do not exceed the individual limit for any single candidate. The Roberts Court has also defined quid pro quo corruption downward in criminal prosecutions, too. In 2016, the court unanimously overturned the conviction of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell by narrowing what counted as an \u201cofficial act\u201d under federal bribery laws. Setting up meetings and introductions with other state officials for a businessman who lavished you and your wife with expensive gifts didn\u2019t count as an official act, the court said; it would have to be something like a vote for legislation.\n\nThe alternative, Roberts warned in his majority opinion, would be a chilling effect on American democracy itself. \u201cOfficials might wonder whether they could respond to even the most commonplace requests for assistance, and citizens with legitimate concerns might shrink from participating in democratic discourse,\u201d Roberts fretted. It may have been the purest expression of the court\u2019s approach to corruption for more than a decade: Americans and their elected representatives can\u2019t be trusted to discern its subtler forms from ordinary political activity, so there\u2019s no point in trying.\n\nPolls frequently show that Americans have low or declining confidence in the American democratic system, especially when it comes to Congress and the political parties. Warren framed her newest bill as a remedy to that disenchantment. \u201cCorruption has seeped into the fabric of our government, tilting thousands of decisions away from the public good and toward the desires of those at the top,\u201d she said in her speech announcing the bill. \u201cAnd, over time, bit by bit, like a cancer eating away at our democracy, corruption has eroded Americans\u2019 faith in our government.\u201d\n\nThe bulk of the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act is devoted to traditional ethics topics. The bill would ban lawmakers, judges, and cabinet members from owning individual stocks to reduce the risk of insider trading, as the recently indicted New York Representative Chris Collins is alleged to have done. It would impose a lifetime ban on the increasingly common practice of lawmakers becoming well-paid lobbyists after leaving public office. And it would require the president and the vice president to divest their personal business holdings and place them in a blind trust\u2014a requirement that squarely takes aim at Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to do so.\n\nLobbyists would take the brunt of the bill\u2019s weight. If signed into law, they would be banned from representing foreign powers and foreign companies. They could no longer make direct donations to congressional candidates or provide gifts to legislators or executive branch officials. Lobbyists would have to wait two years before taking a government job related to their specialty, and government officials would have to wait two years before becoming a lobbyist. (Those requirements would jump to six years for lobbyists who represent corporations.) And their interactions with lawmakers would be scrupulously documented for the public to see.\n\nWarren\u2019s bill delves into other thorny legislative subjects, including federal judicial powers and federal agency rulemaking. To reduce corporate influence on the latter, the bill would impose new restrictions on the types of research that agencies could consider when they craft regulations. It would also limit what Warren describes as \u201cabusive injunctions from rogue judges\u201d by only allowing the federal appellate courts to block an agency\u2019s final rule from going into effect.\n\nIn one provision, Warren even tries to outflank the Roberts Court on an issue that will likely come before it soon: the Chevron doctrine, named after the 1984 case Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council. Under the doctrine, courts typically defer to a federal agency\u2019s interpretation of congressional statutes when the agency crafts rules and regulations to enforce those statutes. That deference is increasingly unpopular among conservative and libertarian legal scholars, who argue that it gives too much power to the administrative state. Others argue that the fault actually lies with Congress and its tendency to craft federal law in broad, vague strokes.\n\nThe justices increasingly appear ready to side with the former. Justice Neil Gorsuch, a prominent critic of the doctrine, shifted the court toward a more skeptical stance on Chevron by replacing Antonin Scalia, who generally favored it on practical grounds. Brett Kavanaugh, who awaits Senate confirmation to replace Anthony Kennedy, also appears to be disinclined to support the doctrine. He referred to it in 2016 as a \u201cjudicially orchestrated shift of power from Congress to the executive branch\u201d and tried to craft a new exception to it while serving on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. If Warren\u2019s bill became law, however, it would write the Chevron doctrine into federal law itself.\n\nAnother provision would rewrite pleading standards in federal courts, taking direct aim at two landmark Supreme Court decisions that made it harder for plaintiffs to bring initial claims in a lawsuit. The court ruled in Bell Atlantic v. Twombly in 2007 and Ashcroft v. Iqbal in 2009 that judges can dismiss a complaint if the plaintiffs fail to state a \u201cplausible\u201d claim. The higher threshold led to a measurable spike in dismissals for civil lawsuits throughout the federal courts, especially for civil-rights cases and employment discrimination claims.\n\nIn other areas, it may be the Roberts Court that outmaneuvers Warren. Enforcing the bill\u2019s myriad new restrictions on lobbyists and public officials would be the new Office of Public Integrity, a federal agency that would absorb ethics-related functions from across the federal government. The office would have a broad array of investigative and administrative powers, including the ability to obtain subpoenas and seek civil penalties against wayward companies and officials.\n\nLeading the office would be a single director to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. To insulate the director from political pressure, the bill would only allow his removal by the president for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d This is somewhat unusual for a federal agency: presidents can generally fire their own political appointees at will, save for the commissioners of independent bodies like the Federal Reserve system and the FEC.\n\nA rare exception is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, another Warren brainchild. The CFPB\u2019s director serves a five-year term and can only be removed from the post by the president for cause. The CFPB director\u2019s independence was intended to give him or her the leeway to challenge business and financial interests without political interference. In 2016, a three-judge panel in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Congress violated the separation of powers by depriving the president of the ability to exercise any control over the CFPB\u2019s functions.\n\n\u201cBecause the [CFPB] director alone heads the agency without presidential supervision, and in light of the CFPB\u2019s broad authority over the U.S. economy, the director enjoys significantly more unilateral power than any single member of any other independent agency,\u201d the three-judge panel concluded in its majority opinion. The opinion\u2019s author was Kavanaugh. While the D.C. Circuit overturned the panel\u2019s ruling earlier this year and affirmed the CFPB\u2019s constitutionality, the issue is likely to make its way to the high court in some form once Kavanaugh is confirmed.\n\nHow the court will respond to other provisions in the bill is unclear. Would the justices determine that Congress\u2019s efforts to impose blind trusts on the president and stock divestments on judges also violates separation of powers? Are its strong constraints on lobbyist activity, including lifetime bans for former public officials, too restrictive of the First Amendment right to petition one\u2019s own government? Is the government unconstitutionally disfavoring certain types of political speech by singling out corporate lobbyists for heavier restrictions than their colleagues?\n\nKavanaugh\u2019s record on campaign-finance cases mirrors those of the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative wing, meaning his replacement of Kennedy is unlikely to change the justices\u2019 current trajectory on the matter. At the same time, his likely confirmation reflects a broader problem for liberal policymakers after Trump\u2019s election. As the court turns further rightward for at least a generation, the prospect that it will foil major policy efforts from the American left only increases. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s anti-corruption bill may be only the first of many Democratic legislative efforts that could face an uphill climb at the nation\u2019s highest court."

    "text": "In February, gunmen burst into the home of an investigative reporter in Slovakia and fatally shot him in the chest. In April, ISIS suicide bombers targeted the press corps in Kabul, killing nine people in a single attack. In June, a disgruntled reader entered the newsroom of the Capital Gazette in Maryland and gunned down four journalists and a sales assistant. And in October, Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post contributor and Saudi exile, was murdered and dismembered by government agents in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul.\n\nAll told, at least 34 journalists were murdered in 2018, an 89 percent increase over the previous year. The number of journalists in jail is also at record highs\u2014251 by the most recent count. To\u00ad\u00adgether, these statistics tell a damning story about the current era, the worst in recent history in which to be a reporter.\n\nJournalists who take on powerful interests have always faced dangers. But even war reporters were once protected by the symbiotic relationship they had with those they covered. If guerrilla fighters or rogue governments wanted to communicate with the world, they had to talk to the press. Killing journalists, quite simply, undermined their ability to get their message out. That dynamic changed with the advent of the internet. By the mid-2000s, Mexican drug cartels had become savvy online users, as had terrorist networks like Al Qaeda. A decade later, the Islamic State developed an even more sophisticated communications operation, with sharp social media strategies, slickly produced YouTube videos, and even a glossy magazine, Dabiq, which published stories outlining the religious arguments for slavery and urging Muslims in the West to join the fight in the Levant. The group almost never interacted with journalists, except when they appeared as props in their elaborately staged execution videos. As governments have pushed ISIS back from its Syrian stronghold, the attacks the group once launched on journalists have become less frequent. Organized crime networks like the Mexican cartels and the European mafia are now the growing threat. And sometimes, as with Khashoggi, a state murders one of its own.\n\nThere is no single explanation for why journalists are being killed and imprisoned. But the disappointing response of the United States government to these crimes\u2014its abrogation of its traditional role as model for a free press\u2014helps explain why the perpetrators are acting with such impunity.\n\n"

    "text": "In many ways, the current dispute over dicamba is an inevitable result of the pressures faced by American row-crop farmers. Brazil\u2019s agriculture industry has modernized, and it now rivals America as the world\u2019s top soybean supplier; Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China, which placed heavy tariffs on American farm products, has cut off many farmers\u2019 biggest customer. The price for soybeans has fallen more than 40 percent since 2012, and American farmers are taking on increasing amounts of debt. \u201cWe just haven\u2019t had any of those really good years in the past ten where we can say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m breathing pretty good now,\u2019\u201d said Tim Sullivan, a farmer in Mississippi County, Arkansas.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, most American farms were small\u2014less than 200 acres, on average\u2014and grew a variety of crops. But through the second half of the century, farms began to specialize in single crops, grown in ever-larger amounts. By the Cold War, the industry had embraced a new motto: \u201cGet big or get out,\u201d as Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz put it during his tenure in the 1970s. In an attempt to corner the global food market, the U.S. government encouraged farmers to buy more land, and to harness the power of chemistry\u2014especially newly developed pesticides and fertilizers\u2014to make sure that land yielded as much food as possible.\n\nThe Arkansas Delta is a great place to go very, very big. It\u2019s hot and humid, with a long growing season. Even better is the soil, with lowlands made of rich silt deposited by the Mississippi River over thousands of years. When white settlers arrived in the early nineteenth century, the region was a dense tangle of swamps, and thickets of wetland forest remained through the middle of the twentieth century. By 1980, when Wallace began farming here, the Delta had become an endless blanket of precisely leveled fields. Today, the region is one of the nation\u2019s leading producers of soybeans. The average farm in Mississippi County, where Wallace lived, is nearly 1,400 acres, more than three times the national average.\n\nThe modern era of agribusiness has placed immense economic pressure on farmers. Tending to a massive farm requires a huge investment in manpower and equipment\u2014GPS-rigged tractors, the latest genetically modified seeds, chemicals for killing bugs and weeds, fertilizers to replenish exhausted soils. Farmers like Wallace typically take out millions of dollars in loans each year in order to cover their operating costs. To stay afloat, therefore, farmers need to squeeze every last cent that they can out of their land. A few surprises\u2014an unexpected dry season or a change in global crop prices\u2014can send a farmer tumbling into bankruptcy. Between 1985 and 1995, 11,000 farmers abandoned the Arkansas Delta, unable to shoulder the financial burden. Home to 235,000 farms in 1935, the region now has fewer than 50,000. Farmers like to see themselves as good, neighborly people. But all the pressure has meant that, increasingly, they have had to look out for themselves. \u201cThis is not a team sport,\u201d Tom Burnham told me. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the most individual sport there is\n\n\u201cThis is not a team sport,\u201d Tom Burnham said of the modern agribusiness era and the pressures farmers face. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the most individual sport there is.\u201d\n\nFor these reasons, farmers in Arkansas still remember 1996 as a year of miracles. That spring, when the first Roundup Ready soybeans sprouted, it was as if the age-old problem of weeds had been solved. Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Monsanto\u2019s Roundup herbicide, is a near-universal plant killer. But Monsanto had genetically altered its seeds so that they could resist the herbicide\u2019s effects. When Roundup was sprayed on a field, the Roundup Ready soybeans were the only things that survived. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe what it could do,\u201d David Wildy said. \u201cIt was a wonderful product.\u201d\n\nThe technological breakthrough led to a fundamental shift in American farming practices. Before, most herbicides were sprayed early in the season, prior to a crop emerging from the soil. With Roundup Ready seeds, however, herbicides could be sprayed during the growing season, \u201cover the top\u201d of the crops. This meant that invasive weeds could be attacked not just once, but multiple times in the course of the season. It also meant that the volume of chemicals sprayed rose dramatically; since Roundup Ready\u2019s introduction, global glyphosate use has increased 15-fold. In America, 94 percent of the nation\u2019s soybeans are genetically engineered to resist glyphosate or other herbicides. The numbers for corn and cotton are similar.\n\nRoundup has not been without controversy. This summer, a California jury awarded nearly $300 million to a groundskeeper who blamed his cancer on the chemical. (In October, a judge reduced the amount to $79 million.) Even for farmers, its miracle had shortcomings. The first problem was chemical trespass. After a farmer sprayed glyphosate on his crops, the wind would pick it up and carry it to nearby fields, killing crops that were not genetically engineered to withstand exposure to the chemical. In 2010, Steve Smith, the director of agriculture for an Indiana-based tomato processor, testified to Congress that over the previous four seasons, the company\u2019s growers had lost more than $1 million worth of crops due to glyphosate drift. It was a preview in miniature of the problems farmers have experienced with dicamba.\n\nThe other trouble with Roundup was that, as powerful as it was, the weeds proved stronger. \u201cMonsanto told us there was no way that we would ever see any plant become resistant,\u201d Wildy told me. \u201cThey went through the whole plant physiology and said there\u2019s no way that this plant can ever become resistant. Well, it did.\u201d In 2000, just four years after farmers began spraying Roundup on their fields, mare\u2019s tail became the first common U.S. weed to develop a resistance to glyphosate. Since then, the number of resistant weed species has climbed at an alarming rate. Palmer amaranth, a type of pigweed, developed resistance by 2005 and quickly became the most hated species of vegetation in Arkansas and across the American South. A single pigweed plant can produce 500,000 seedlings, making it extremely difficult to keep in check. The weed climbs high above row crops, blocking out the sun. Studies have shown that an invasion of pigweed can reduce a farmer\u2019s yields by 79 percent. \u201cThe pigweed\u2019s smarter than we are, it seems,\u201d Wildy said. \u201cIt\u2019s changing faster than we can develop technology or chemistry to control the thing. And it\u2019s bad enough that it can take us out of business.\u201d\n\nMonsanto\u2019s Roundup revolution gave birth to this superweed\u2014but it also created an opportunity to profit. The company knew that if it could develop a new seed that could survive a different type of herbicide\u2014one to which weeds were not yet resistant\u2014it would be a blockbuster. In 2005, the path forward became clear. Scientists from the University of Nebraska approached Monsanto with the news that they had discovered what could be the next big thing in agriculture: a bacterial gene for dicamba resistance that could be imported into plants.\n\nDicamba kills plants by mimicking auxin, a growth hormone; plants that are exposed to dicamba literally grow themselves to death, their cells reproducing so quickly that they cannot absorb enough nutrients to sustain themselves. Dicamba is especially deadly to broadleaf plants such as cotton and soybeans. It is also a particularly volatile chemical, which means it easily evaporates after spraying and can be carried by the wind\u2014often in unpredictable directions\u2014making it far more drift-prone than glyphosate. One farmer told me its effects were like a bomb: You see a blast radius of damage surrounding the point where it was sprayed. Over the years, farmers learned that dicamba was useful so long as it was managed carefully\u2014sprayed early, before crops emerged, to kill off-season weeds, or along fencerows and in pastures. But it was almost never used near soybeans or cotton or other delicate plants\u2014and it was illegal to spray over the top, once the plants began to emerge from the soil.\n\nMonsanto\u2019s development of dicamba-resistant seeds was therefore met with worry. \u201cThe widespread use of dicamba is incompatible with Midwestern agriculture,\u201d Steve Smith, the tomato processing official, declared in his 2010 congressional testimony. Its volatility, he said, would simply doom crops like peaches or vegetables or pecans\u2014anything, really, besides the resistant beans.\n\nAs it had done with Roundup, Monsanto planned to develop a line of dicamba-resistant seeds and a matching dicamba-based herbicide. But it needed to clear two hurdles before these products could be released commercially: The Department of Agriculture had to approve the seeds for sale, and the Environmental Protection Agency had to sign off on the company\u2019s herbicide, so that farmers could legally spray it over the top of their crops.\n\nMonsanto initially said that it would not release its new products until both the seeds and the herbicide were approved. After the Department of Agriculture approved a line of dicamba-resistant cotton seeds in January 2015, however, Monsanto announced a limited release, enough seeds to cover a half-million acres. The seeds had other new genetic traits that Monsanto was eager to share with the world, the company said. And because the EPA had not yet approved the spraying of dicamba, Monsanto offered farmers a rebate. The seeds sold out.\n\nDicamba\u2019s effects are like a bomb: You see a blast radius of damage surrounding the point where it was sprayed.\n\nEarly that season, cotton farmers began to complain of dicamba damage. In Arkansas, the plant board determined that in 14 cases, crops had been affected by exposure to the chemical. Two of those cases were against a farmer named Lonnie Gibson. In May 2015, an investigator, prompted by an anonymous complaint, arrived at a field where Gibson\u2019s workers were spraying chemicals. The man in charge identified himself as Curtis Jones. He refused to sign the official paperwork that acknowledged that the field was under inspection and declined to help take samples from the spray tanks. He claimed to know nothing about what chemical was being sprayed, or even what crop was being planted. He told the investigator that she would have to wait for Gibson\u2014but Gibson never appeared. During the delay, some of the tanks and chemical containers were removed from the scene. \u201cMr. Jones was not cooperative,\u201d the investigator later wrote in her report. She eventually determined that dicamba had been sprayed illegally, and Gibson was fined. (He is currently suing the plant board, contesting that decision.)\n\nOther farmers were more cooperative. In 2015, when Mike Wallace filed his initial complaint about dicamba drift against one of his neighbors, a farmer named Donald Masters, Masters admitted to his crime. He tried to abide by the old code: He told the plant board that he had paid another neighbor whose crops were harmed, and was willing to pay Wallace, too\u2014until Wallace made unreasonable demands. \u201cI damaged at least 10 acres of his [soybeans],\u201d Masters said in his testimony to the plant board, \u201cbut he asked me [for] $100,000 for his cotton. Well, his cotton wasn\u2019t damaged.\u201d\n\nMasters\u2019s testimony included an interesting admission. He said he had purchased the dicamba-resistant cotton seeds because a Monsanto sales representative \u201cpretty well assured\u201d him that the EPA would approve the chemical for spraying. Some farmers contend that such promises were part of an official strategy\u2014that Monsanto wanted\n\ndicamba to be illegally sprayed. This would allow the company to \u201ctest the water to see what kind of repercussions\u201d would result from dicamba hitting untargeted fields, as one group of farmers has alleged in a lawsuit. Monsanto has repeatedly denied these charges.\n\nWhatever the intentions, it was clear that the damage did not faze Monsanto. In October 2015, as the cotton harvest was coming in, Monsanto officials announced that dicamba-resistant soybeans, recently approved by the USDA, would go on sale too. The seeds flew off store shelves. According to Monsanto\u2019s estimates, four million acres of dicamba-resistant crops were planted in 2016\u2014five times more than in 2015. The company\u2019s latest product was looking like a success.\n\nSpraying dicamba remained illegal, however. Monsanto expected that its new dicamba-based herbicide would be on the market by the 2016 season, but \u201cwe got delayed in Washington, D.C., with the EPA,\u201d said Scott Partridge, Monsanto\u2019s vice president of global strategy, who was recently named the general counsel for parent company Bayer\u2019s U.S. operations; the German pharmaceutical giant purchased Monsanto this summer. (The delay may have been due in part to the nearly 17,000 public comments the EPA was sifting through as part of the approval process.) Penalties for illegally spraying dicamba were paltry, though\u2014often little more than $1,000. So for farmers who had purchased Monsanto\u2019s dicamba-resistant seeds, the advantages of illegally spraying dicamba far outweighed the fines that the government might impose or the anger of their neighbors. As an Arkansas plant board official told The Wall Street Journal in 2016, \u201cThe farmers are flat out telling us that \u2018we\u2019ll write you a check.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn November 2016, less than a week after Mike Wallace\u2019s funeral, the EPA finally approved Monsanto\u2019s dicamba-based herbicide, XtendiMax. (Two similar formulations from other companies were approved shortly thereafter.) Monsanto said that XtendiMax was approximately 90 percent less prone to drift than earlier formulations. In theory, this should have ended the controversy over dicamba. Farmers would finally be able to spray dicamba legally, and the problem of drift would, for the most part, be solved.\n\n\n\nAs the spring 2017 growing season got underway, however, it became clear that dicamba damage remained out of control, triggering the current spate of lawsuits and investigations by state plant boards. Some experts who study and regulate the industry believe the extent of the damage could be as much as ten times higher than the 3.6 million acres officially reported. Crop insurance does not cover damage by herbicides, so farmers have little incentive to file complaints and potentially start neighbor-versus-neighbor disputes.\n\nMeanwhile, independent studies have suggested that dicamba is still highly prone to drift; the XtendiMax formulation can remain in the air for 36 hours after spraying. Monsanto has argued that these tests are cursory and small-scale compared to its own, and that most dicamba damage has been caused by farmers failing to apply the herbicide correctly. Dicamba acts differently from glyphosate, which farmers are more familiar with. \u201cIt takes different application methods and a focus that growers and applicators need to learn,\u201d Partridge said. \u201cThere\u2019s a learning curve here.\u201d\n\nFor farmers who planted Monsanto\u2019s new seeds, the advantages of illegally spraying dicamba far outweighed the paltry fines the government might impose.\n\nCritics have also accused the EPA of failing to provide adequate oversight. As it weighed whether to approve XtendiMax, the agency only considered data submitted directly by Monsanto itself, which has come under fire in the past for attempting to influence its scientists\u2019 findings. The company would not allow universities to conduct independent tests on XtendiMax prior to the product\u2019s EPA approval. The company believed that such tests would take too long and further delay EPA approval at a time when farmers needed the chemical. \u201cThe decision was made\u2014rather than delay a full year to permit academic testing, let\u2019s get it registered with the EPA,\u201d Partridge said. \u201cLet\u2019s get the product in the marketplace so we don\u2019t have two years of the seed with-out the chemistry.\u201d\n\nCritics, however, argue that the company\u2019s real worry was the potential for negative results, which could squash Monsanto\u2019s hopes for EPA approval of its blockbuster new product. This is a key component in many of the lawsuits against Monsanto. Some scientists now suggest the EPA\u2019s chemical registration process needs to be updated to incorporate more extensive independent testing. \u201cThe problems that occurred in 2017 speak for themselves,\u201d the Weed Science Society of America wrote in a recent report. \u201cMore funding for public research is needed. The true cost of the dicamba-resistant crop technology is not being reflected in the price.\u201d\n\nIn response to the reports of dicamba drift that have flooded state agencies, Monsanto touted all the steps it had taken to address the problem: The company released a new app that detects problematic weather and distributed a million spray nozzles to farmers, free of charge; across the country, 96,000 farmers enrolled in a training program that is a new legal requirement for anyone who buys or sprays XtendiMax. The company also set up a phone line for farmers to report potential cases of crop damage. Chemical drift, Partridge argued, is less extensive per acre sprayed now than it was in 1996, when Roundup Ready was first released\u2014it\u2019s just that dicamba was adopted so much more rapidly than Roundup that the effects have been more obvious. (When I asked for drift data from 1996 to verify the claim, a Monsanto representative said the company had none.) Partridge suggested we live in a different era, too. \u201cIn 1996, when growers wanted to talk about something that they were worried about, or something they needed to learn more about, they talked about it around a four-top table in a coffee shop,\u201d Partridge said. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s on social media, where fact and fiction can take on lives of their own very, very quickly.\u201d\n\nBut at least part of the reason farmers have been buying Monsanto\u2019s dicamba-resistant seeds is to protect their fields. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve done,\u201d David Wildy told me this summer. \u201cAnd I hate to have to do that, but we just had to.\u201d He\u2019d suffered, by his own estimate, hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses over the previous two seasons. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have that kind of damage again,\u201d he said. Monsanto denies that it wants a product that is prone to drift, but the fact that the herbicide can spread easily offers a clear advantage to the company. Once one local farmer adopts the technology, his neighbors have little choice but to do the same.\n\nMy drives across Arkansas this summer were often beautiful. The sky, which stretched endlessly above the flat, lush fields, flared with clouds at sunset. But once farmers taught me how to identify dicamba damage, I began to see the landscape differently, as a slow apocalypse revealed itself in small, grim details. At one lake I drove past, the cypress trees\u2014the last remnants of the wetlands that once dominated the region\u2014bristled with brown needles. At a garden stand, the flowers\u2019 leaves curled inward, a classic sign of dicamba\u2019s effects. Unlike soybean farmers, backyard gardeners have no defensive choice; there is no engineered seed to plant.\n\nA beekeeper who had kept hives in Mississippi County for decades told me he\u2019d had to relocate them; the bees were struggling to produce honey. The culprit, he was almost certain, was the dicamba-induced death of the few stands of wild plants amid the monoculture, essential habitat for pollinators.\n\nNear Wilson, Arkansas, I met with Reggie Cullom, a local doctor who had bought a patch of land because he loved its groves of pecan and oak trees. \u201cI\u2019m the only guy in the world who ever paid farmland prices to pick up limbs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was important to me to try to save the trees.\u201d Now, though, trees that yielded a ton of pecans each season are struggling to produce just 300 pounds, he said. As we drove in Cullom\u2019s truck across his property, he pointed to the treetops, where the leaves were yellowed. Along the edge of the property, the leaves on young oak trees shriveled inward.\n\nCullom\u2019s neighbor, a retired farmer, saw us roll past and ambled over to chat. He got out of farming five years ago, he told me, just early enough to avoid the current dicamba craze. \u201cWe used to use dicamba years ago\u2014but it was early in the year,\u201d he said, and just on certain crops. \u201cAfter that, it was over with.\u201d Before Monsanto released its dicamba-resistant seeds, there was no reason for farmers to spray the herbicide throughout the growing season. Now, he said, he\u2019d like to eat his own vegetables, grow his own fruit\u2014but he can\u2019t. It\u2019s a disorienting development. \u201cI got to thinking one day: What\u2019s going on? What\u2019s changed since I was farming?\u201d\n\nFor today\u2019s farmers, the modern agriculture business can feel like an arms race, in which the only choice is to embrace the latest genetically engineered seeds and the chemicals that go with them. Just as weeds developed resistance to Roundup, however, it\u2019s inevitable that they will develop resistance to dicamba, too\u2014and what will farmers do then? Companies like Monsanto have relied on the idea that science and technology can always be harnessed to overcome whatever challenges the environment presents farmers. But there may be limits to what science can achieve. No new weed-killing chemical has been identified since 1992\u2014which is why chemical companies are returning to older, problematic herbicides like dicamba. Meanwhile, the plants continue to evolve. Jason Norsworthy, an agronomist at the University of Arkansas, told me some farmers are likely to run out of chemical options soon. \u201cI wish I could tell you the future looks bright, ten years, 15 years from now,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nLast summer, as complaints of dicamba drift continued to mount, the Arkansas plant board decided to take action. It announced an emergency ban on all dicamba use and was empowered by the state legislature to levy harsher fines, up to a maximum of $25,000. Some farmers objected\u2014at a board meeting, one noted that farmers in the state had already spent more than $140 million on dicamba-resistant seeds, money that would go to waste if they couldn\u2019t actually use dicamba. In September 2017, more than 300 Arkansas farmers signed a petition opposing the ban. (Tom Burnham, who opposes irresponsible dicamba use, helped draft the language.) They asked the plant board to allow limited use of dicamba under certain conditions. When used responsibly, they argued, dicamba is extremely effective, and the state\u2019s ban had put local farmers at a disadvantage. \u201cPigweed is a major problem in Arkansas, and the state should not be the only state in the South not allowed to use dicamba,\u201d the farmers said.\n\nIn a sign of just how contentious dicamba had become, prosecutors and defense attorneys consciously avoided mentioning the herbicide during Curtis Jones\u2019s trial for killing Mike Wallace. There was too much baggage associated with dicamba, prosecuting attorneys told me. In December 2017, a jury convicted Jones of second-degree murder. He is currently free on bond, awaiting his appeal. (Jones works at a farm chemical store in Missouri that is owned by Lonnie Gibson. When I stopped in, I was told he was out planting watermelons; I left my phone number, but Jones never called.) That month, the Arkansas legislature also asked the plant board to reconsider the dicamba ban. In January, however, the plant board voted to extend it indefinitely.\n\nTensions over dicamba remain high, and more violence seems possible. One farmer at the center of the controversy said he keeps three loaded guns in his office.\n\nDespite all the controversy, the new soybeans remain popular. Monsanto estimated that 50 million acres of dicamba-resistant seeds were planted in 2018, more than twice the acreage that was planted last year. And in Arkansas, despite the plant board\u2019s ban on dicamba, it is clear that farmers aren\u2019t heeding the prohibition. During my visit to the Delta in June, damage reports were already trickling in. Farmers drove me through their fields and pointed out the places where their soybeans\u2019 leaves were crumpling. By season\u2019s end, at least a million acres across the country had been hit\u2014less than in 2017, but still an enormous amount. In October, the EPA extended its approval of dicamba for two years.\n\nSo far, Mike Wallace has been the only person to lose his life in a dicamba-related dispute, but the potential for more trouble seems palpable. There are neighbors who are no longer on speaking terms; squabbles occasionally become fistfights. When I stopped for lunch near where Gibson and Jones live, a group of farmers at a catfish shack warned me to tread carefully, given the tensions. Another farmer, who has been at the center of the debates over dicamba and has been the target of substantial ire, told me he keeps three loaded guns in his office.\n\nEven if farmers in the Arkansas Delta manage to keep the peace, it\u2019s clear that the controversy over dicamba has fundamentally transformed the nature of American farming. One hot and cloudless afternoon this summer, I climbed into the cab of Tim Sullivan\u2019s pickup truck, and together we bumped along a rutted dirt road at the edge of one of his fields, examining the soybean crops. For Sullivan, checking for dicamba damage is now a daily routine during the growing season. The symptoms\u2014the crumpled leaves, the wilting stems\u2014are so familiar to him by now that he can spot them even while driving.\n\nSullivan had recently filed a complaint with the plant board and blamed one of his neighbors for the damage. He understands why someone would spray; farmers need to make a profit. \u201cI get along with him, and just because he sprayed me, I\u2019m not going to try to beat him up, you know?\u201d Sullivan told me. But Sullivan also has to watch out for himself. If another farmer\u2019s chemicals trespass on his fields, he\u2019s going to turn them in to the authorities. The old handshake agreements by which farmers used to resolve disputes will no longer suffice. \u201cHe\u2019s a fine old gentleman, you know,\u201d Sullivan said of his neighbor. \u201cBut he broke the law.\u201d"

    "text": "Since reentering politics several years ago, Donald Trump has defined himself in opposition to a single figure: Barack Obama. He was the leading proponent of birtherism in 2011 and continued to promote the conspiracy theory publicly until 2015. (He reportedly has remained a birther in private.) Some believe Trump only decided to run for president because Obama made fun of him once. In declaring his candidacy, Trump described Obama as a \u201cnegative force\u201d who was \u201cnot a leader.\u201d And his campaign platform, such as it was, centered on undoing Obama\u2019s legacy: He pledged to reverse Obama\u2019s immigration policies, repeal Obamacare, and, in the words of running mate Mike Pence, undo \u201cevery single Obama executive order.\u201d\n\nHe has governed as promised. \u201cTrump is obsessed with Obama,\u201d New York Times columnist Charles Blow wrote last year, noting that \u201cmuch of what Trump has accomplished\u2014and it hasn\u2019t been much\u2014has been to undo Obama\u2019s accomplishments, like pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris climate agreement and reversing an Obama-era rule that helped prevent guns from being purchased by certain mentally ill people.\u201d He concluded, \u201cFor Trump, the mark of being a successful president is the degree to which he can expunge Obama\u2019s presidency.\u201d\n\nTwo years into Trump\u2019s presidency, however, it\u2019s clear that he aspires to undo more than just the Obama era. Some of his most high-profile actions have sought to reverse decades of progress\u2014by Democratic and Republican administrations alike\u2014in protecting the environment, workers\u2019 rights, and public health. If Trump succeeds, his own legacy won\u2019t be defined by his erasure of Obama\u2019s accomplishments so much as the destruction of the modern regulatory state as we know it.\n\nAndrew Wheeler, the acting administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, last week announced a plan to rewrite the Clean Water Rule, a 2015 regulation which ensured that small bodies of water like wetlands and streams would be protected by the Clean Water Act of 1972. But the new rule, if implemented, would do much more than just reverse an Obama-era protection. \u201cThis would be taking a sledgehammer to the Clean Water Act and rolling things back to a place we haven\u2019t been since it was passed,\u201d Blan Holman of the Southern Environmental Law Center told the Los Angeles Times."

    "text": "\u201cIn sum, the Investigation revealed that the Foundation was little more than a checkbook for payments to not-for-profits from Mr. Trump or the Trump Organization,\u201d the attorney general\u2019s office said in a lawsuit this summer. \u201cThis resulted in multiple violations of state and federal law because payments were made using Foundation money regardless of the purpose of the payment. Mr. Trump used charitable assets to pay off the legal obligations of entities he controlled, to promote Trump hotels, to purchase personal items, and to support his presidential election campaign.\u201d\n\nThough the Trump Foundation was an impressively brazen scheme, it\u2019s far from the only one bearing the president\u2019s name. Trump agreed to pay $25 million to settle a multi-state class-action lawsuit against Trump University, his now-defunct real-estate seminar program. Court filings showed how the seminars preyed on customers\u2019 financial anxieties so they would fork over thousands of dollars for mundane lessons about buying and selling property. This undercut Trump University\u2019s main selling point: that \u201cstudents\u201d would be able to draw upon its eponymous founder\u2019s reputation for savvy real-estate deals.\n\nEven this reputation isn\u2019t grounded in anything, though. The underlying basis of Trump\u2019s political career is his public image as a self-made real-estate magnate. Careful scrutiny by journalists and investigators, however, has shown this to be largely mythical. It wasn\u2019t business acumen that helped Trump establish a foothold in New York real estate in the 1980s and 1990s, but a steady infusion of at least $413 million from his father through dubious tax practices. Trump\u2019s inflated reputation is a source of income in and of itself. Many of the overseas hotels bearing his name don\u2019t even belong to him: He simply licenses his image to real-estate developers overseas, giving a branding edge to them and a reliable stream of profit to him.\n\nYou\u2019d be hard-pressed to find an aspect of the president\u2019s life that isn\u2019t marked by grifting. The Trump campaign and its allies heard multiple offers of assistance from Kremlin-linked figures while Trump\u2019s personal lawyer tried to secure a hotel deal in Moscow. His inaugural committee later raked in more than $100 million\u2014more than twice the sum of his predecessors\u2014from wealthy donors that largely went unaccounted for. A ProPublica investigation found that the Trump Organization may have overcharged the committee for use of Trump\u2019s Washington hotel, raising questions about whether any illegal self-enrichment took place. (Federal prosecutors are reportedly investigating the matter.) Foreign governments have also poured money into the Trump Organization\u2019s properties, which may violate a constitutional ban on federal officials receiving foreign profits.\n\nIronically, some of these schemes likely would have gone unnoticed if Trump had never run for president. Fahrenthold, of the Post, began his Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning investigation into Trump\u2019s charitable donations after then-candidate Trump handed out oversized checks to veterans\u2019 groups in campaign stunts. And the illegal hush-money payments that eventually led former Trump attorney Michael Cohen to start cooperating with the federal prosecutors likely wouldn\u2019t have been made if Trump wasn\u2019t trying to win the presidency. Becoming president has subjected Trump\u2019s hollow empire to a level of scrutiny that he never imagined. The question is whether any of it will remain by the time he leaves, or is forced from, the White House."

    "text": "If you\u2019re like most folks, you\u2019ll be spending a fair chunk of this month in a tipsy haze as you flit from one holiday party to the next in a halcyon glow of seasonal intoxicants. And who can blame you? December in America is when we happily mistake the Christmas spirit for the Christmas spirits. Spiked eggnog, of course, flows as freely as organically farmed pine needles across your living room floor. Hot toddies welcome flushed cheeks in from the cold and novelty tipples\u2014from winter ales to peppermint punch\u2014dot the holiday landscape. And then there are the subtle variations on the besotted theme, like the bowl of French vanilla ice cream festively drizzled with cr\u00e8me de menthe or the deeply profound but subconscious urge to buy vanilla extract by the quart.\n\nDecember in America is when we happily mistake the Christmas spirit for the Christmas spirits.\n\nIt\u2019s nearly impossible to resist. There are endless parties\u2014your office holiday party, your partner\u2019s office holiday party, your apartment building\u2019s holiday party, your friend\u2019s holiday party, your other friend\u2019s holiday party\u2014punctuated by foggy, smaller get-togethers involving carols, fireplaces, and several empty bottles of wine. Even the office cookie exchange has lost its innocence: Fair-trade cocoa rum balls are the new butterscotch. And, really, unless you\u2019re an alcoholic (like me, hi there!), why should you resist? Liquor stems the intense drudgery of office-party discussions about other people\u2019s children and their inevitable gluten allergies, honor roll triumphs, and pediatric social anxieties. And by the end of the party, you either have to be spectacularly wasted or ready to run like the wind when you hear the words \u201cIs that a Xerox machine I see before me?\u201d Meanwhile, you and your colleagues have spent the last several days leading up to Christmas vacation in a kind of dazed buzz thanks to an administrative assistant\u2019s talent for producing midday sweets filled with full shots of some toxic, exotic liqueur that leaves you all wheezing at first and then sends you off for the afternoon in dreamy subdued moods. What else is there to do?\u2014say, \u201cOh, no thank you. Really, I hate feeling good in the middle of the day\u201d and then go ask your boss for more work? No, you take the wee nip here and there (surely that wasn\u2019t just in my office?). Then you can tolerate, nay, revel in a city swaddled in a hallucinogenic wonderland of multicolored, blinking lights, garlands, tinsel, wreaths, and Santa hats.\n\nBut let\u2019s remember what this time of year is really all about: getting together with your dysfunctional families to exchange odd gadgets from Brookstone while simultaneously navigating the dicey politics of divorce and internecine sibling rivalries about who is mom\u2019s favorite (it isn\u2019t you). And that means more hooch to ease the passive aggressiveness and simmering resentment. The liquor stores have been ready for the onslaught since before Thanksgiving, stocking up to accommodate everyone from Uncle John and his Maker\u2019s Mark to cool post-grad Sara and her fetish for Chilean wines. And then there are the made-for-TV movies that grandma loves\u2014the ones in which all a young boy wants for Christmas is to be reunited with his landmine-sniffing American hero puppy. You practically have to drink to get through that.\n\nWhat will I do this December out on my alcoholic island?\n\nYet once the office shenanigans are over and the family time accrued, there is still more glitz. To reward yourself for having so much fun all month, you turn your attention to the very last day of December and cap the whole affair off with New Year\u2019s Eve\u2014an event for which drinking prolifically is expected lest you be deemed a pagan heretic and for which champagne itself was apparently created. This, it turns out, is what you have been building up your tolerance for all month."

    "text": "In August 2008, just before the slow-moving financial crisis turned into outright panic, the secretary of the Treasury, Hank Paulson, traveled to the Summer Olympics in Beijing. At a private lunch with Chinese officials, he learned that members of the Russian government had been urging the Chinese to join them in selling off large portions of their holdings in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the multitrillion-dollar companies that supported (and still support) much of the American mortgage market. The goal, it seemed to Paulson, was to force the U.S. government into an unplanned emergency bailout of the two companies\u2014or risk destabilizing the economy by making it impossible for people to get mortgages. \u201cWhenever I envisioned the Russians selling, the knot in my stomach got bigger,\u201d Paulson told me recently. (The Chinese, for their part, declined to sell.)\n\nShares in the two companies had been declining precipitously since late 2007, and even before Beijing, Paulson had been scrambling for a solution. The month before the Olympics, Congress, with urging from Paulson, had passed a law allowing the Treasury to make unlimited investments in Fannie and Freddie\u2014a sort of first-strike doctrine in case Paulson needed to offset a crash. As Paulson told the Senate Banking Committee, \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a bazooka and people know you\u2019ve got it, you may not have to take it out.\u201d\n\nAs the companies\u2019 stocks continued to fall that summer, Paulson decided he was going to need the bazooka; he believed investors wanted assurance that Fannie and Freddie would not be allowed to fail. The problem was that the legislation, as written, gave the government the right to inject capital into Fannie and Freddie only until the end of 2009, which would not be long enough. So Paulson and his team took a little creative license. They devised a structure that in essence enabled the Treasury to invest in \u201cperpetual preferred stock\u201d\u2014essentially loans with no date at which they had to be redeemed\u2014from the companies to cover their losses for years into the future, as long as the deal to do so was struck by the end of 2009. The team at Treasury took what Congress had meant to be a temporary guarantee and transformed it into a permanent one.\n\nIn enacting the eventual bailout of the American financial system, Paulson\u2014with Ben Bernanke at the Federal Reserve and Tim Geithner at the New York Fed\u2014took his cue from leaders in other desperate times. \u201cThe country needs and, unless I mistake its temper, the country demands bold, persistent experimentation,\u201d said Franklin Roosevelt in 1932, as America battled the Great Depression. \u201cIt is common sense to take a method and try it: If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something.\u201d When Roosevelt was sworn in as president the following year, he tried not just \u201csome\u201d things, but a lot of them, passing landmark financial laws, some of which still govern banks in this country. In 2008, Paulson, Bernanke, and Geithner were even bolder and more persistent in their experiments. They didn\u2019t always wait for Congress to give them permission. Instead, they stretched existing laws to their legal limit, and used new laws in ways that defied congressional intent."

    "text": "Count the holiday cards on your mantel: That\u2019s how many people care about you. That\u2019s the premise of a 2003 study of social network size carried out by evolutionary anthropologists Robin Hill of the University of Durham and Robin Dunbar of Oxford and published in the journal Human Nature, anyway. Aiming to test the hypothesis that there\u2019s a cognitive limit on the number of meaningful, reciprocal relationships\u2014or, \u201cfriendships\u201d\u2014humans can maintain, Dunbar and Hill gathered information on the Christmas cards sent and received by 43 British households, ending up with data on the trajectories of nearly 3,000 cards. Christmas cards are a good measure of social networks, according to the Dunbar and Hill, because \u201cIn Western societies\u2026the exchange of Christmas cards represents the one time of year when individuals make an effort to contact all those individuals within their social network whose relationships they value.\u201d\n\nHaving discovered a correlation between the size of the average social group and a part of the brain called the \u201cneocortex\u201d among various primates, Dunbar had posited 150 as the maximum number of friendships humans can maintain. There was some ethnographic and historical evidence to support this hypothesis\u2014150 happens to be the average size of most military units, Neolithic farming villages and hunter-gatherer communities\u2014but the Christmas card study was the first empirical test of what came to be known as \u201cDunbar\u2019s number.\u201d As they predicted, Dunbar and Hill found that the average number of Christmas cards received by each household hovered around 150. The mean number sent out ranged from 11 to 149, averaging out to about 68, though many cards were addressed to couples or families. About 21 percent of cards were sent to family members. Dunbar and Hill concluded:\n\nEven in contemporary western societies, where individuals are operating egocentric networks within a virtually infinite array of social possibilities, social network size and differentiation reflect the sociocentric networks observed in traditional societies, suggesting that the cognitive constraints on network size may apply universally to all modern humans.\n\nBut is the traditional Christmas card becoming obsolete? \u201cThe increase in social media, and the current financial climate, means that fewer Christmas cards are sent,\u201d said Hill. Not only are eCards faster and cheaper to send en masse, but the ease with which we can share infinite holiday photos on Facebook makes choosing just one seem unnecessary. Sales of holiday cards in the U.S. dropped from 1.8 billion in 2009 to 1.5 billion in 2011. \u201cNevertheless, we would expect the cards to be sent to core members of the network, with electronic greetings for less important relationships. You could still use Christmas cards in a study today, although you might expect slightly different patterns to our original study.\u201d\n\nEven if email has made communication easier, the size of our neocortex hasn\u2019t changed. \u201cIt is an interesting question whether people send more email cards,\u201d said Dunbar. \u201cI would hazard a guess not: The number of friends people have on Facebook is not significantly greater than 150, and on the whole people send cards only to those they care about.\u201d"

    "text": "The French, with their penchant for putting a twist on Anglicisms, have lately become fond of the phrase parler cash, which means to speak bluntly. Marine Le Pen parle cash: \u201cThe emperor has no clothes,\u201d she mocked amidst the Yellow Vest unrest. \u201cWhen Macron was a candidate, they told us he was a professional, an expert in economics, rigorous to a fault.\u2026 In fact, he\u2019s a total amateur, totally unprepared, and totally indecisive.\u201d\n\nSuch is Le Pen\u2019s revenge. In the televised debate between the first and second rounds of the presidential election, Macron demolished his opponent\u2019s confused efforts to explain how she would withdraw France from the euro, as she had threatened, while continuing to participate in a \u201ccommon currency\u201d\u2014the fallback position to which she had retreated when it became apparent in the closing weeks of the campaign that abandoning the euro was an unpopular option. Le Pen became lost in her notes and flailed, trying to parry Macron\u2019s professorial interrogation. Now, Macron finds his policies under relentless interrogation by the Yellow Vests, and Le Pen has been liberated to dismiss as a feckless amateur the \u201cprofessor\u201d who previously humiliated her.\n\nHow can Macron respond? Macronism always rested on the assumption that France\u2019s problems stemmed from being out of step with its European partners. Writing anonymously in Slate\u2019s French edition, a high civil servant at home with Macron\u2019s technocratic idiom put it this way: The driving force behind Macronism is \u201cthe feeling that France\u2019s situation is abnormal, especially in regard to the [very high] level of public spending and social protection.\u201d The implicit bargain was that Macron would change France to look more like its European partners; in return, Europe would assume national security and economic regulatory functions that the nation-state could no longer fulfill. But Macron has always been careful to say that he favored not just any Europe but only l\u2019Europe qui prot\u00e8ge, the Europe that protects. He has accordingly tried to cast himself as a \u201cprogressive,\u201d whereas opponents such as Le Pen and Italian vice-premier Matteo Salvini were \u201cnationalists.\u201d\n\nBut so far, the European Union has not taken Macron up on his invitation to position itself as a protector rather than an enforcer, and rhetorical divisions between the French and other Europeans seem to be growing. European leaders I\u2019ve spoken to seem to see the recent uprising as confirmation of Macron\u2019s own description of his countrymen as \u201cGauls resistant to change.\u201d Macron, meanwhile, has given some ground to the nationalists, saying that one source of the rebels\u2019 anger is their \u201cfear\u201d of \u201can ultraliberal [in the sense of \u201cultracapitalist\u201d] Europe that no longer allows the middle class to live decently\u201d\u2014a rather damning accusation from a man who normally presents himself as a staunch defender of both the European Union and global capitalism. Meanwhile, a temporary respite has set in. The number of demonstrators in the so-called Act Six of the uprising was down sharply, and the emergence of an overtly anti-Semitic element among the protesters has damaged the movement\u2019s image.\n\nPierre Person, a Macron aide involved in planning the strategy for the May 2019 European parliamentary elections, says that success will hinge on his party\u2019s ability to make Europe\u2019s protective function credible to voters whose fears the president so accurately described. It is hard to see how this can work: France\u2019s European partners, already wary of Macron\u2019s reforms, are now so resistant that when the European Council met in mid-December, Macron\u2019s proposal for increasing the EU budget was dismissed with a one-sentence statement deferring further consideration until next fall. Macron may be willing to consider angry Yellow Vest voices. But in Europe\u2019s high councils, the only acceptable\u2014or salonf\u00e4hig, to borrow the German term that literally means \u201cacceptable in the drawing room\u201d\u2014language remains that of the technocrats, who continue to insist that one model fits all and no change is required. Astonishingly, the unrest in France has thus far elicited little acknowledgment from Brussels of the need for change in EU governance practices. If President Macron is to win his battle with the populists, he will need allies, yet the EU, having papered over its differences with the populist government in Italy, seems content to pretend that it can continue on its charted course despite the prospect of still more severe turbulence ahead."

    "text": "December still sees a deluge of cash-grabbing holiday albums, but most are unrelentingly awful. Leading this year\u2019s onslaught is Cee Lo Green\u2019s \u201cMagic Moment,\u201d a collection in which the only original, \u201cAll I Need Is Love,\u201d is a throwaway collaboration with the Muppets, and the album \u201cCheers, It\u2019s Christmas\u201d from country singer Blake Shelton, the centerpiece of which is a chintzy cover of Canadian kitsch-spinner Michael Bubl\u00e9\u2019s \u201cHome.\u201d Christmas releases by the pop-country act Lady Antebellum and the pop singer Christina Perri barely show signs of a pulse, with one unremarkable original each. Dutiful, nostalgic covers of old standbys\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll Be Home for Christmas,\u201d \u201cWinter Wonderland,\u201d \u201cLet It Snow! Let It Snow!\u201d\u2014abound.\n\nThe songs that have stuck around since the glory days of Christmas pop music to hinge on emotions more intense than mild nostalgia. A great holiday song needs a lot of things\u2014a hook, a voice\u2014but the most important is feeling: \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You\u201d would never work without its unguarded enthusiasm. A song like \u201cChristmas (Baby Please Come Home),\u201d meanwhile, is powered by rawness and sorrow.\n\nBut the gradual secularization of Christmas in American culture has taken its toll on the music industry. As the religious purpose of Christmas has gotten increasingly remote, pop songwriters seem to have less to say about it. Today Christmas recordings are reliable but rarely spectacular sellers. To share real feeling is to take a risk, and the music industry is more risk-averse than ever. In our most beleaguered entertainment sector, even ambiguously Christian pop stars like Bieber or the high-wattage songwriters they work with don\u2019t want to take a real chance on Christmas. (\u201cEveryone\u2019s gathering around the fire,\u201d Bieber sings in Auto-Tune-sprinkled \u201cMistletoe,\u201d \u201cChestnuts roasting like a hot July.\u201d)\n\nPerhaps the only place where the Christmas song still thrives is an arena that should be allergic to its charms: that supposed hotbed of irony and subversion, indie rock. In 2010, Beach House released the gorgeously depressive free holiday single \u201cI Do Not Care for the Winter Sun.\u201d This year the orchestral indie-pop singer Sufjan Stevens released Silver & Gold: Songs for Christmas, Vols. 6-10, an attention-testing compilation of original holiday songs and fractured covers recorded between 2006 and 2012. It\u2019s a warbly, frequently trying exercise\u2014though when it gets noisy and transgressive, a rewarding one. At the very least, it\u2019s taking a form of American vernacular music seriously while having some fun with it.\n\nIn the age of irony, indie rockers may be the only musicians with no cultural cachet to lose when it comes to Christmas. If Christmas has been secularized to the point that its meaning has splintered, indie rockers are engaging with it in part to deconstruct it. The Magnetic Fields wrote a sardonic, slightly confounding Christmas song\u2014with one verse in German\u2014for a non-Christmas album in 2010. In 2004, the Walkmen released the inebriated, discursive single \u201cChristmas Party,\u201d which embraced the company of old friends and familiar songs only as a salve for being otherwise alone. These songs poke at Christmas from the margins, and yet most them end up telegraphing something earnest and true."

    "text": "Most people who try comedy take months, if not years, to perfect their stage set. But the first time Midge ever tells a joke into a microphone, she kills. In the first season, I experienced her sui generis success as a triumph; it wasn\u2019t necessarily something she had earned with hard work, but she did source her punchlines from a very real font of personal suffering. When the show opens, Midge, aka Miriam Maisel, has a \u201cperfect\u201d life: a yawning Upper West Side apartment, a husband who wears a suit and hat to his office job, two healthy children under the age of five, and a robust social life that includes calisthenics in hot pants and putting together children\u2019s goodie bags with her perfectly coiffed, platinum best friend (whose pastel outfits and bristly lack of humor are to be read as signs that she is a gentile). Midge has a quick wit (she delivered the toast at her own wedding, making a joke about shrimp that made the Rabbi gasp) but somehow never feels bored by preparing brisket to bring to the owners of a comedy club where her husband tells jokes (that he has plagiarized, by the way). She has a closet full of jewel-toned swing coats and cinched-waist cocktail attire that made her look like Grace Kelly playing a fashion editor.\n\nAnd then, the idyll all falls apart: her husband leaves her (for his secretary), she has to move out of her apartment and back in with her parents (a math professor and a socialite, who conveniently live right upstairs), she starts to spiral. So she gets drunk on a bottle of red wine, takes the subway downtown in the rain, and hops on stage, wet and drunk, at a Greenwich Village comedy club. But when Midge gets on stage, her spiel is fresh, partly because she isn\u2019t really doing jokes. She\u2019s just waxing about her life, mocking the name of the secretary (it\u2019s Penny Pan), threatening to show the audience her breasts to prove how perky they still are. But because she\u2019s being honest, she gets laughs.\n\nAudiences aren\u2019t used to hearing a woman speak openly about anything, let alone about infidelity. Of course, her looks (radiant, slender, excessively symmetrical) add to the potency of what she is saying: a beautiful woman breaks down. It doesn\u2019t feel at all threatening to the crowd, just amusing. Even as she is hauled off to jail for baring her breasts\u2014where she is bailed out by her new pal Lenny Bruce (Luke Kirby)\u2014it is seen as a lovable turn which she plays for laughs, even as she\u2019s being dragged out of the club. She clearly doesn\u2019t fear the police, or any other consequences that might come her way as a result of being publicly transgressive. Midge\u2019s fears are more localized: that her social circle might judge the meltdown of her marriage, that her parents might disapprove of her extracurricular fascination with performing, or that she might have to\u2014gasp\u2014get a day job (which she does, selling lipsticks at a department store).\n\nIn season two, Midge\u2019s blistering ascent through the comedy ranks (and through any obstacle she encounters) continues more or less unabated. We rarely see her children, who stay with her parents every night while she goes out to smoky clubs (her parents have no idea; they think she\u2019s dating). She plotzes for the first single man she is set up with, a strapping doctor (Zachary Levi) whose mother meets Midge\u2019s mother, Rose, in a Catskills beauty salon. He, in turn, is immediately smitten in return; even though she is a divorcee, Midge is still the most desirable bachelorette in town.\n\nSusie, her manager remains the only character to put Midge in her place; when Midge says she needs to leave for two months to take a vacation, thereby slowing Susie\u2019s ability to book her into clubs, Susie offers a reality check. She questions Midge\u2019s privilege, telling her that while she might enjoy gallivanting in the mountains, the sacrifices required to become a professional comedian are extreme, and the stakes for Susie are high. She is living in a dump, and finds herself in danger after Midge outs a very successful rival during her act. Midge is a hobbyist, at least at first, and Susie desperately needs her to become a professional.\n\n"

    "text": "Earlier this year, amid \u201cinternal divisions\u201d in the party, Pelosi signaled her intention to put pay-go into the rules package. \u201cDemocrats are committed to pay-as-you-go,\u201d her spokesman, Drew Hammill, said in June. Former Progressive Caucus chair Ra\u00fal Grijalva (D-AZ) responded by calling pay-go \u201can absurd idea,\u201d saying it\u2019s \u201cirresponsible to try to tie up Congress\u2019s ability to respond to economic downturns or, in the current discussion, to slash programs.\u201d\n\nPelosi has defended and expanded pay-go for over a decade. She first instituted it as a standing rule the day she received the speaker\u2019s gavel in 2007, and was a driving force in passing the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act in 2010, signed by Barack Obama. That law puts the burden on the president to enforce across-the-board cuts if Congress violates pay-go. The prospect of any president implementing an unpopular hatchet job like that is remote. So the House rule looms large in this fight by constraining new spending at its source.\n\nObviously, Pelosi and her allies on pay-go consider the rule good politics, allowing them to rebut charges about \u201ctax and spend\u201d liberals by insisting that every new program is fully paid for. If anybody actually cared about the deficit, instead of habitually using it as a weapon to rein in the opposition party, maybe that logic would be compelling. But even if the politics make sense, the rule leads to bad policy, as Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute, which is quite close to House progressives, argues in a paper last week.\n\nAs Bivens explains, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s subsidies were artificially made smaller because of pay-go rules. Democrats also created a long implementation period for Obamacare, with four years between signing and the effective date of the exchanges. That allowed adherence to pay-go within the ten-year budget window. But it also denied benefits to the public for an exceedingly long period, during which Republicans swept into virtually all levels of government.\n\nA pay-go rule is even more dangerous in a time of economic downturn, when government needs to be the spender of last resort. \u201cIt is terrible economics to view federal budget deficits as always and everywhere bad,\u201d Bivens writes, and that\u2019s especially true when the economy is struggling. Democrats, he notes, were obsessed with President George W. Bush \u201crunning up the nation\u2019s credit card\u201d on wars and tax cuts when the real focus should have been on deregulation that was weakening financial markets."

    "text": "As December came around this year, I received an email from a Jewish organization. \u201cSome of us may be bracing for a month full of Christmas envy,\u201d it cautioned, \u201cand it\u2019s easy to understand why. Christmas is everywhere, from the aisles of our local drugstores to the playlists of our favorite radio stations.\u201d The email warned against a \u201cplan to spend the next month staring longingly through neighbors\u2019 windows at their tinsel-decked trees.\"\n\nI was befuddled. Christmas envy? Christians should envy me. December 25 is one of my favorite days of the year. I don\u2019t have to work. I eat a fun ethnic meal (the clich\u00e9 is true: It\u2019s sometimes Chinese). I see a movie. And I celebrate my own heritage: Being Jewish on Christmas is like having one\u2019s Jewishness traced in bright, red-and-green ink.\n\nPart of my love for Christmas is based on the same aesthetics that everyone else likes about the holiday. The seasonal/pagan elements are undeniably beguiling: I cherish the culmination of fall, the smell of pine, and the snow; and even I cannot help but associate them with Christmas. I love the songs\u2014many of which, anyway, were composed by Jews. I enjoy glad tidings as much as the next person, whatever their theological origin. On Christmas Day, the streets are pretty, and empty, and when I find myself in the suburbs, parking is a breeze. (Closed businesses are only a minor inconvenience, I\u2019ve found, and anyway Starbucks tend to be open until 4 p.m.)\n\nChristmas is, in other words, a f\u00eate for the Jews, too. This seems obvious when you think about it. But in recent years all the hoopla over Christmas\u2019 actual meaning\u2014and the concomitant hoopla over the coastal elites\u2019 alleged top-secret crusade to drain Christmas of said meaning\u2014masks the fact that Christmas is also a holiday for the coastal elites. In other words: Jews like me! In fact, it\u2019s more: to borrow from the liturgy of Passover, this day off is different from all other days off. Unlike Thanksgiving, there is no exhausting obligation to spend time with family. Unlike the three-day weekends, it is unlikely to be annexed by a wedding. And unlike New Year\u2019s Eve, there\u2019s no feeling of obligatory raucousness. You can just not work or go to school, and instead hang out with your friends. And if it happens not to turn out the way you want? Unlike a Christian, you probably won\u2019t spend the next month in agony over whether or not you\u2019re a loser from a dysfunctional family."

    "text": "First of all, my mother brought me up this way. A German Jew whose ancestors emigrated to the U.S. from Frankfurt before the Civil War, she assumed that Christmas was as inclusive a national holiday as Thanksgiving or Independence Day. Every year, we had a tree, festooned with frosted glass balls and little ornaments, some plastic and others cardboard. A few of the latter were handed out by local businesses. I recall one tiny Santa distributed by a local savings bank who advertised the prevailing interest rate on his red pot-belly. Of course, my mother filled my stockings and bought me a team of milk chocolate reindeer and put my presents under the tree. I knew the words to all the most popular carols, although I stuttered trying to pronounce \u201cGood King Wenceslas.\u201d One night before the big day, we would drive around our suburban New Jersey county to find the prettiest or, at least, the most outlandish lawn displays.\n\nHow my mother and I observed Christmas was firmly rooted in American tradition. As Stephen Nissenbaum shows, in his indispensable book, The Battle for Christmas, most devout Christians refrained from celebrating the holiday until the middle of the 19th century. They scorned the way peasants, slaves, and laborers marked the occasion with heavy drinking, cross-dressing, and fornication. In 1659, the General Court of the Massachusetts colony even \u201cdeclared the celebration of Christmas to be a criminal offense.\u201d\n\nBut with the emergence of a modern market economy in the 19th century came the desire to exchange gifts in a domestic setting that, for an increasing number of urban-dwellers, was no longer a place of work but a refuge from it. In the 1820s, some German immigrants introduced the Christmas tree, a relatively new custom first popularized in Strasbourg, and it was promoted by Unitarians and other reforming types who saw it as a device to help turn the holiday into a romantic ritual centered on teaching children about the joy of being good. The branches of the evergreen tree, wrote the feminist Margaret Fuller in 1844, \u201ccluster with little tokens that may, at least, give them a sense that the world is rich, and that there are some in it who care to bless them. It is a charming sight to see their glittering eyes\u2026\u201d\n\nBecause Santa Claus\u2014as concept and mass-produced image\u2014made kids brighten up even more, he too became part of the new ritual. His artisanal workshop, comments Nissenbaum, evoked a pre-industrial past which disguised \u201cthe fact that most of the presents he brought were commodity productions.\u201d And because Santa made presents for all children everywhere in the world, he became a grand surrogate or even a substitute for Jesus. Salvation may be possible for all, but, in the meantime, a new train set or a necklace would be just fine. Singing about a white Christmas and displaying a balloonish St. Nick on your front lawn are thus not commercialized departures from tradition but the logical extension of it.\n\nSo I am enjoying Christmas in a completely appropriate, even patriotic fashion. Can I make an aesthetic argument for my preferences? Not really. But then, when it comes to holiday observances, the heart wants what the heart wants. So say what you will: I am going to have myself a merry little Kitschmas."

But that attitude is at odds with the pluralist character of the United States that, contra various religious right myths, goes back to its founding. So if you want Christmas to be totally pervasive, as many Christians desire, as opposed to merely almost-totally-pervasive, then its religiosity needs to be underplayed. Or if you want to return it to its role as a holiday about Jesus, then it has to be something other than \"our national holiday.\"\n\nNow, obviously, some religious conservatives don't mind if Christmas is secularized but object to people saying \"Happy Holidays\" in public, while others want the holiday to be more openly Christian but don't expect the entire culture to be subsumed in it. But the general tendency on the right is to demand both things, and there's the rub."

Instead, I\u2019d ask him a lot of questions like, \u2018what do you think?\u2019 or \u2018does that make sense to you?\u2019 I wasn\u2019t trying to push my views on him and make him take a stand against religion. I just didn\u2019t want to indoctrinate him. I was trying to let him figure things out for himself.\n\nIC: At what point did you announce your beliefs and say \u2018I actually don\u2019t believe in God, we can celebrate Christmas, or your grandparents can celebrate Christmas, but I don\u2019t believe this.\u2019\n\nDM: It was toward the middle of elementary school, like 3rd or 4th grade, where I became much more forthright by saying, \u2018I don\u2019t believe in the stories about God.\u2019 I told them, \u2018this is my view, and if you choose a religion when you get older that\u2019s perfectly fine with me.\u2019 I was divorced so my children would sometimes go to church with their Dad. It was a little bit confusing for them in the beginning, but I did tell them that they would have the chance to choose whether or not they wanted to believe.\n\nIC: Did you feel like when you told them your beliefs that they were at all disappointed?\n\nDM: I really didn\u2019t feel like that they thought that. I mean, at times, I know that they still struggle with the whole concept of afterlife, death, and you know, being mortal. They just sort of took it all in stride, as kids often do.\n\nIC: It is a bummer when you realize that you\u2019re mortal. I remember that.\n\nDM: Yeah. I had bought one of my kids an astronomy book because he was really interested in the subject. When he read about black holes and about how big and old the universe is, he felt a sense of existential dread and sort of freaked out. Other parents have told me that their kids struggle with mortality, too. I think it\u2019s common for children to have an \u201coh my God\u201d moment. They realize, \u201cI\u2019m just like the stars. I\u2019m going to burn out one day, too.\u201d\n\nIC: Yes, the realization that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you is a complex one.\n\nDM: Yes. But it is also very humbling.\n\nIC: I was thinking about raising kids, and while I don\u2019t believe in God, I want to say to them that they can believe whatever they want to believe, because if they decide to be religious then that\u2019s their choice. On another level, Jesus actually wasn\u2019t the son of God and I should state that as a fact rather than say you can choose and all opinions are equally valid.\n\nDM: I definitely wouldn\u2019t advocate lying to your kids. You know, when they say \u2018what do you think happens after we die?\u2019 I tell them, I don\u2019t know, but this is what I think: we die, we go into the ground and we become fertilizer. You know, that\u2019s it.\n\nIC: Maybe shy away from saying you become fertilizer when they\u2019re too young.\n\nDM: [Laughs] Right, for sure. Maybe say instead, we\u2019re part of the circle of life. We become part of the earth again, from which other things will grow. But, you know, these are conversations we have now. I never lie to them about anything in regards to God or whatever knowledge that we have. Jesus may have been an actual man, we know that, but there\u2019s no evidence he was divine.\n\nIC: Apparently he was a white man.\n\nDM: Right, I thought that was funny. There are no descriptions of Jesus\u2019 appearance in the New Testament, but I\u2019m sure, living in the Middle East, he was not a blue-eyed, white guy.\n\nIC: You want your kids to be open-minded but you also don\u2019t want to tell them that every opinion is equally valid.\n\nDM: That\u2019s true, but you run into another problem that when they\u2019re young and you\u2019re trying to talk to them about religion, they\u2019ll then go off to school and talk to their peers. And these kids go and tell their parents, so you have to be careful when they\u2019re young.\n\nIC: I imagine you have paid some attention to the War on Christmas. I always thought that the War on Christmas was a positive sign about where our culture was, that people at Fox News or wherever had lost, and this was a sign of reaction.\n\nDM: I agree, I think it\u2019s a good sign. It\u2019s a sign that things are changing. You hear the whole war on Christmas thing, it seems silly. I live in Texas, where they recently passed the Merry Christmas bill, a law that says you can have holiday displays at school as long as you don\u2019t promote one particular religion. So you can have a nativity scene as long as you also have another holiday symbol like Santa or a menorah. The funny thing is that these symbols are supposed to be sacred to the church, but we buy a cheap plastic Jesus at Wal-Mart, haul him across town and plop him in front of a school. It seems to take some of the sacredness out of it. You\u2019d think that the Church would want to keep their symbols on their property sort of like an authorized dealer. It just seems a little odd to me, anyway.\n\nIC: Odd, in the sense that it\u2019s so removed from the original intent?\n\nDM: Yea, like they want to force it into places where it doesn\u2019t really belong. This past weekend, we had a parade in our town. There was a front-loader tractor in the parade with Santa and his reindeer on top and Jesus, Mary and Joseph in the dirty bucket. That seems so ironic.\n\nIC: I gather you enjoy celebrating Christmas now.\n\nDM: Yes, absolutely.\n\nIC: What\u2019s your routine, do you have a routine?\n\nDM: We do the same thing as Christians do. We get up in the morning and we open gifts. We don\u2019t go overboard with gift-giving\u2014just a couple. We have our meals, and we celebrate with family and friends. If we\u2019re visiting my mother\u2014she\u2019s Catholic\u2014we will attend church with her if she wants. We also give to the community through special, Christmas-time donations or by picking angels from the angel tree."

    "text": "It\u2019s difficult to imagine today, but there was a time when \u201cSilent Night\u201d was not virtually synonymous with Christmas. As recently as the nineteenth-century, Christmas was not widely celebrated in the English-speaking world. The Puritans ignored it because the Bible was silent on the topic, while New Year\u2019s was the traditional day of gift-giving in Britain. Carols, though, were popular, and the first significant collection of carols was published in 1833. Though it contained classics like \u201cThe First N\u00f6el\u201d and \u201cGod Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,\u201d it, and its 1852 successor, make no mention of \u201cSilent Night.\u201d\n\nThat changed with the Victorians. When the German-born Prince Albert married Queen Victoria, he brought many of the traditions of his native land to Britain, including the Christmas tree, gift-giving, and cards. In 1848, the Illustrated London News published a drawing of the royal family celebrating the holiday around a Christmas tree, and the practice quickly caught on around the country. Victoria and Albert also presided over the revitalization of many carols, setting old words to new music. It is probably during this period that many British people were first introduced to \u201cSilent Night.\u201d\n\nThe song we know as \u201cSilent Night\u201d was born as \u201cStille Nacht, heilige Nacht\u201d in a small Austrian village in 1818. According to legend, the church organ was broken on Christmas Eve, so the organist and town priest collaborated to create the carol with a guitar accompaniment in order to ensure that the people of Oberndorf did not go without music on the holy night. The song was translated to English by an American Episcopal priest in 1859.\n\nThough Christmas had become a national tradition by World War I, \u201cSilent Night\u201d was far from the dominant song of the season. But by the time of the famous 1914 Christmas truce\u2014100 years ago this Christmas\u2014the carol played a crucial role in bringing about the temporary break in the fighting. All along the trenches, two sides started singing carols at each other. After the musical icebreaker, some of them met in No Man\u2019s Land, exchanged presents, and played makeshift soccer games."

    "text": "Tensions were further inflamed as Conservative politicians were photographed smiling at food banks, a \u201cphoto opportunity\u201d Corbyn quickly denounced during the weekly Prime Minister\u2019s Questions. The Trussell Trust, a charitable organization of over 420 food banks across the UK, has warned of unprecedented projected levels of usage leading up to Christmas.\n\nOne of the culprits behind this increase, the UN report and Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn argue, is Universal Credit, a reform spearheaded by the Conservative Party that was meant to simplify the welfare system by streamlining multiple benefits into one monthly payment. Announced in 2010 at the Conservative Party Conference, UC, as it is informally known, began to be introduced in 2013 and was supposed to be rolled out across the U.K. by 2017. It has yet to be fully implemented and has been plagued by IT failures and accusations of management problems. In a letter to the Guardian in October, heads of multiple poverty and homeless organizations wrote that \u201cone in five claims to universal credit currently fail because claimants find the process too complex,\u201d leaving impoverished households \u201cwithout essential support.\u201d The combined payment also takes five weeks between people successfully filing a claim and when they actually receive benefits, with some reports of delays as long as twelve weeks. Labour member of Parliament Frank Field said in October that the delay had driven some of his female constituents to sex work.\n\nFood banks have reported a fourfold increase in visitors, and a 52 percent increase in the number of three-day emergency food packages distributed, in areas where Universal Credit has been in place for 12 months or more, the Trussell Trust reported in April. Again, the wait time is the suspected culprit. \u201cThat is an awfully long time to wait, during which time many clients have been thrown into crisis, unable to afford a food shop and forced to come to the food bank,\u201d Alice Clifford, who volunteers at a London food bank, told me. The UN rapporteur similarly blamed the delay, writing that it \u201cpushes many who may already be in crisis into debt, rent arrears, and serious hardship, requiring them to sacrifice food or heat.\u201d\n\nHomelessness, meanwhile, is on a disturbing rise. Statistics released this month reveal that there are currently more than 120,000 children in temporary homes including bed and breakfast rooms and hostels\u2014a twelve-year high. The charity Shelter put the number of homeless in Britain at 320,000 this year\u2014an increase of 4 percent from the previous year. Official figures suggest that between 2010 and 2017 there was a 169 percent rise in homelessness.\n\nThe decisions forced by such rising numbers can be devastating. \u201cBecause resources are so scarce it turns council workers into \u2018guardians\u2019 of a very limited \u2018pot of gold,\u2019\u201d Edward, a London social worker, told me. \u201cSo instead of being agents who are there to help people, they become people who have to guard against people who don\u2019t deserve it enough: It\u2019s soul destroying.\u201d He compared it to the Victorian notion of the \u201cdeserving\u201d and \u201cundeserving\u201d poor, portrayed in Dickens\u2019s novels through characters such as Bob Cratchit in A Christmas Carol\u2014decent and hard working, as compared to Bill Sikes, the villain in Oliver Twist. \u201cYou find yourself, without even realizing it, considering who deserves your help the most,\u201d Edward said."

It was the year that Cambridge Analytica became a household name, and the year that social media was implicated not only in data misuse and election interference, but ethnic cleansing. Perhaps above all, this was the year that Big Tech lost its luster, when Google, Facebook, Amazon, and others finally came under widespread scrutiny\u2014from the press, politicians, and the broader public alike.\n\nAnd 2018 isn\u2019t even over yet, much to Facebook\u2019s chagrin. The New York Times delivered another shock on Tuesday, reporting that the company gave Microsoft, Spotify, Netflix, Yahoo, and some of the other biggest tech companies in the world \u201cmore intrusive access to users\u2019 personal data than it has disclosed, effectively exempting those business partners from its usual privacy rules.\u201d Facebook even allowed Netflix and Spotify to read its users\u2019 private messages. On Wednesday, news broke that D.C.\u2019s attorney general is suing Facebook over Cambridge Analytica scandal.\n\n\n\nDespite all this, 2018 could have been an even worse year for Big Tech. The idea of reining in the Silicon Valley giants has only slowly gained momentum in Washington, and signs point to modest regulations. No one on Capitol Hill is really talking about breaking up Facebook or Google or Amazon, who are spending millions on lobbying to ensure that they have significant input in whatever Congress cooks up. And although tech companies are taking election interference more seriously, it\u2019s believed that most of the major players\u2014principally Russia\u2014sat out the 2018 midterms. The post-2016 electoral system remains largely untested.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s fortunate, because it has become increasingly clear that the U.S. is at least as vulnerable today as it was then. While Congress and tech companies have been busy conducting autopsies of the 2016 election, they have been slow to address the problems exposed by foreign interference. Meanwhile, intelligence operatives in Russia and other countries have been developing new influence tactics. And America\u2019s voting infrastructure remains just as antiquated as it was two years ago."

    "text": "More also needs to be done to improve conditions for current prisoners. A group of Democratic senators introduced the Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act in July 2017, which focused on the unique challenges facing women behind bars. The First Step Act includes some of its provisions. It will formally ban federal prison officials from shackling pregnant women before, during, and shortly after they give birth, which can pose health risks. It also requires the Bureau of Prisons to consider placing incarcerated parents near their children.\n\nBut other parts from the 2017 bill are worth implementing, such as banning federal prisons from charging prisoners for their phone calls and requiring the Bureau of Prisons to implement video conferencing technology free of charge. Both measures would try to rein in companies that charge exorbitant rates for prisoners to stay in touch with the outside world. The Federal Communications Commission tried to cap prison phone rates under existing laws in 2015, but telecom companies successfully persuaded a federal appeals court to strike down the restrictions last year.\n\nMost of the First Step Act focuses on sentencing and incarceration. Other aspects of the criminal justice system are in dire need of reform, too. In 2015, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott drafted the Walter Scott Notification Act in response to increased public scrutiny of police shootings. The bill would require state and local police departments that receive federal funds to submit yearly reports to the federal government about police shootings by their officers, the race and gender breakdown of those shot, and other valuable data points.\n\nThe senator named the bill after Walter Scott, to whom he is not related, after North Carolina police officer Michael Slager shot and killed Scott during a daytime encounter in 2015. Footage of the officer shooting him in the back drew national condemnation; Slager received a 20-year sentence after he pleaded guilty to federal civil-rights charges. Senator Scott\u2019s bill would shine a light on one of the great statistical voids in modern American law enforcement. The closest thing to a national database on police shootings is currently maintained by The Washington Post. Scott tried without success to include his bill in the First Step Act; it\u2019s worth trying again.\n\n\n\nAnd if federal lawmakers want to truly reduce unnecessarily harsh sentences and tackle excessive incarceration, they could reverse one of the major tough-on-crime policies of their predecessors. Most states use parole to alleviate high prison populations and to help people convicted of crimes transition back into normal life more quickly. The federal government, however, abandoned the practice in the early 1980s. The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 abolished the federal parole system for future inmates. The practical result is that there are few mechanisms to release federal prisoners who pose no danger to society or risk of re-offending."

      "Jonathan Chait"
    ],
    "text": "My earliest Christmas memory is of dogmatic conflict. I spent hours trying to disabuse my elementary-school classmates of their belief in Santa Claus. My passionate (and, I should point out, correct) arguments met with horrified indignation. Historical vindication\u2014most of my peers came around to my point of view by the time we reached high school\u2014did little to win back their warm regard. In fact, I have just one other opinion that consistently provokes the same level of vituperation as Santa heresy. It happens to impugn another holiday nostrum: gift giving. My case is rooted in a simple, and I would say noble, desire to promote human progress. After all, when we troop to the mall to pick out presents for our loved ones, we are reverting to barbaric rituals that predate the rise of trade. \u201cAn intensive circulation of gifts and return gifts, of ceremonial and hallowed offerings,\u201d writes economic historian Georges Duby, \u201cpermeated the entire social structure\u201d of pre-modern Europe. The proliferation of presents, while economically inefficient\u2014\u201dThese offerings partly destroyed the products of labor\u201d\u2014were justified as promoting \u201cgoodwill.\u201d Worst of all, you couldn\u2019t escape the gift cycle. Quoting anthropologist Marcel Mauss, Duby notes \u201c[B]asically they were strictly obligatory, under pain of private or open warfare.\u201d While these scholars were describing a primitive economy, it still holds true. If you don\u2019t believe me about private or open warfare, try telling, say, your girlfriend that you don\u2019t do gifts. More on that below.\n\nThe gift-based economy died out because currency rendered it obsolete. So it\u2019s curious that one month out of the year we resurrect this brutally inefficient custom. It has little to do with generosity: gift transactions are enforced by threat of social alienation\u2014the accusation of being a \u201cScrooge\u201d\u2014and undertaken with the expectation of receiving equal compensation. (Unilateral gifts, like those from parents to young children, are OK in my book.) But if greed is the motivation for holiday gift giving, then it\u2019s misplaced. Which brings me to the crux of my economic argument against rampant present-purchases. Gift givers and receivers actually deprive one another of wealth. How? Well, holiday presents are usually not functional goods, such as cereal, but instead luxuries that we wouldn\u2019t buy for ourselves, such as fancy chocolates. If you and I exchange boxes of chocolates (or some such frippery), we\u2019ve essentially forced one another to purchase chocolates for ourselves. But there\u2019s a reason people don\u2019t often buy themselves fancy chocolates: most of us would rather get M&Ms and spend the rest of the money on something else. Christmas spawns industries devoted to useless goods like fruitcake and flavored popcorn. More commonly, it forces us to pay for things we like, but whose cost exceeds their worth to us. Suppose a box of chocolates costs $15. I don\u2019t buy chocolates for myself, because they\u2019re worth only $5 to me. You choose not to buy $15 cologne because it\u2019s worth only $5 to you. Swapping chocolates for cologne penalizes each of us $10. Yes, sometimes you can buy somebody a gift he would buy for himself. But the more likely this is, the higher the likelihood that he actually has it already. OK, so gifts detract from our material welfare. But, you point out, they still provide psychological benefits\u2014goodwill, etc.\u2014beyond their tangible value. The problem is, you can use that argument to preserve any inefficient practice. Gift-based societies also buried the dead with all their worldly possessions. This often impoverished the deceased\u2019s surviving family, but it gave them considerable psychological benefits. Of course, once society figured out its wastefulness, those psychological benefits disappeared. Why should we derive satisfaction from impoverishing those we hold dear?\n\nNow, some in the pro-gift faction actually argue on economic grounds, too. The economy, they say, depends on frenzied holiday-induced sales. Actually, it doesn\u2019t. Economists incessantly lecture us to save more\u2014our national savings rate is notoriously low, after all\u2014and consume less. And discontinuing gifts would give consumers more satisfaction with less stuff, by letting them choose what goods they end up with when the tinsel or the Menorah have all been packed away. Those previously employed in the field of fruitcake manufacturing would find work making things people actually want. Worse still, gifts deflate productivity. Indeed, the culture of gifts glorifies nonproductivity. The best gifts must be laboriously sought (like this year\u2019s ridiculously scarce toy sensation Tickle Me Elmo; a New York Post headline the week before Christmas caught the spirit: \u201cSCALP ME ELMO!,\u201d it read) or, better still, hand-crafted. According to gift etiquette, a present\u2019s value directly correlates with the effort put into it. But, people ask, wouldn\u2019t I like to own a sweater that my mother knitted for me? No. In a fraction of the time it would take her to knit a sweater, my Mom could earn enough money at work to buy me a much nicer sweater and have plenty of cash left over for herself. A homemade sweater would merely make me feel guilty that Mom had wasted all those hours during which she could have been enjoying a good book. If jobless mothers insist upon adding to the GNP every Christmas, they can calculate the hours they would have wasted on non-cost-effective sweater-knitting and instead use that time laboring in a workplace that uses efficiency of scale\u2014say, a steel factory\u2014and send a portion of the proceeds to their children. That check from home would be so much more satisfying if you knew your mother had spent a whole day smelting iron for it.\n\nObviously, my logic has not yet won over a majority of the population\u2014most importantly, that segment of the population that is dating me. A month after we began dating, my girlfriend celebrated her birthday. Shortly before her birthday dinner, I stopped at the corner store looking for a card. I ruled out any cards featuring big-eyed fuzzy animals or messages that end in exclamation points. That eliminated all the birthday cards. Giving her a get-well card struck me as inappropriate. After long minutes of deliberation I settled on a relatively understated anniversary card, taking care to cross out the word \u201canniversary\u201d and write in \u201cbirthday.\u201d My anti-gift arguments having met with an unenthusiastic reception, I decided to throw in a present. In an effort to preserve my intellectual integrity, I gave her a gift certificate, the closest acceptable substitute for cash. So far so good. Where I probably went wrong, in hindsight, was in my choice of gift certificate. I recycled one that a friend had given me the previous year. Re-gifting wasn\u2019t a problem, I figured. We could use the certificate (for a meal at the Cheesecake Factory) on a date. For weeks, though, she declined to go. Eventually, after I pressed, she revealed that the gift certificate had expired months before her birthday. The blame for this tragedy, obviously, rests on society. Last week, I gave my girlfriend a scarf, a nice one, not previously owned. Foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds."

    "text": "President Trump is ready to shut down the government over his central campaign promise\u2014building a wall along the southern border\u2014and he seems to believe he has the upper hand in this debate.\n\nThe Democrats, who know Steel Slats (Wall) are necessary for Border Security, are putting politics over Country. What they are just beginning to realize is that I will not sign any of their legislation, including infrastructure, unless it has perfect Border Security. U.S.A. WINS! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 20, 2018\n\nIt would be audacious, to say the least, to blame Democrats for a government shutdown. The GOP controls the entire government\u2014at least until Democrats take over the House next month\u2014so Republicans would be shutting down their own government. And just last week, in a meeting with Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, Trump took ownership of a potential shutdown, saying, \u201cI am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck. Because the people of this country don\u2019t want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country. So I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I\u2019m not going to blame you for it.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut the idea that Trump has a political advantage over Democrats on the broader issue of immigration is not so easily dismissed. Support for the border wall, while still a minority of Americans, recently hit an all-time high. Although Trump\u2019s fear-mongering over the migrant caravan failed to block the blue wave in last month\u2019s midterm elections, there are reasons to believe that immigration will be a potent, even decisive issue in 2020, just as it was in 2016.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the question of where Democrats stand on the issue\u2014which isn\u2019t entirely clear. They\u2019re betting that Trump\u2019s radicalism makes them the de facto party of reasonable immigration policy. But the risk is that the opposite will happen: that in the absence of a clear, affirmative message from Democrats, the public will see Trump and the Republicans as the ones doing something rather than nothing to address America\u2019s broken immigration system."

It\u2019s a Wonderful Life, the latest example of Capracorn, shows his art at a hysterical pitch. Capra\u2019s moralizing, which is driven home in films packed with absurdly over-simplified characterizations and unbearable whimsy, is presented with great talent almost wholly through visual detail. It has never been told so frantically as in this expression of how kind, innocent and happy the \u201clittle\u201d people are on Main Street.\n\n\n\nThe postwar Jimmy Stewart looks a shade more mellow and works much harder at his acting, but he\u2019s still stuck in It\u2019s a Wonderful Life with his traditional character grown flat with usage\u2014unassuming, a bit shy, sincere as a Boy Scout, a passionate spokesman for the little people. His George Bailey is a golden-hearted small-town businessman forever thwarted in doing big things by his ties to family and friends. Year after year he scrapes along in the small-town rut he hates, doing a good deed here and a better deed there, selling houses with his golden heart instead of his head.\n\nOne day Bedford Falls\u2019s meanest man (Lionel Barrymore, who in other years at this time has played Scrooge) steals money for which George is responsible, and George, faced with disgrace, works himself up into a first-class tizzy. His character changes so drastically\u2014he becomes a whimperer, a mean drunk, suicidal\u2014 that you wonder where this side of him has been hiding. It seems reasonable to suspect that Jo Swerling, who is credited with doing additional scenes, got in an additional character too. An angel (Henry Travers) comes down, cures Jimmy by showing him the good he did in Bedford Falls, and Jimmy goes home to find his friends have given him a laundry basket full of dollar bills. Admirers of this honest, hard-working, self-sacrificing character Stewart has played since he left Princeton are going to be uneasy when they see Jimmy\u2019s face light up like a Christmas tree at getting all this free dough.\n\nCapra is an old-time movie craftsman, the master of every trick in the bag, and in many ways he is more at home with the medium than any other Hollywood director. But all of his details give the impression of contrived effect."

      "Miguel Salazar"
    ],
    "text": "Around the time Cat Brooks stepped into the East Bay DSA meeting in July, a similar controversy broke out in the organization\u2019s Philadelphia chapter. In an email to the chapter\u2019s political education committee, a small group of DSA organizers had proposed a new book by Asad Haider, a University of California graduate student and editor of Viewpoint magazine, for a reading group. The book, Mistaken Identity: Race and Class in the Age of Trump, envisions a socialism that both addresses racism head-on and advances a class-based movement.\n\nHaider adopts an understanding of identity politics first introduced by the Combahee River Collective, a black lesbian militant group, which held that \u201cthe most profound and potentially most radical politics come directly out of our own identity, as opposed to working to end somebody else\u2019s oppression.\u201d The idea is that an authentic socialist movement needed to go beyond a vision of \u201csexless, raceless workers\u201d; it required centering the identities and lived experiences of marginalized groups, in order to address issues that wouldn\u2019t necessarily be mended through economic reforms alone.\n\nThe political education committee responded that it was no longer creating new reading groups. So the organizers, who belonged to a subcommittee created in 2017 to develop local socialist campaigns, held the reading group anyway. On the day before the first meeting, however, they received a letter from the chapter\u2019s leadership. The event, they wrote, was \u201cunrelated\u201d to the subcommittee\u2019s stated purpose; the group was acting \u201cautonomously, apparently as a protest.\u201d Leadership provided an ultimatum: Stay focused on local political campaigns, or resign.\n\nThe two sides exchanged correspondence for weeks. Then, in late August, Jacobin published a scathing review of Mistaken Identity, penned by Melissa Naschek, the Philadelphia chapter\u2019s co-chair. Attempting to engage in both class politics and identity politics, she wrote, was the left\u2019s own Third Way: a \u201clopsided advocacy for particularist demands\u201d that would lead the movement to a dead end. The only path to forging a mass socialist movement, she wrote, was by fighting for \u201cuniversalist\u201d reforms, like single payer health care and free college tuition.\n\nThe essay sparked a heated, sometimes nasty intellectual debate, often conducted in the kind of dogmatic jargon that was once a hallmark of Marxist academia. The DSA members who originally proposed the book for the reading group interpreted the review as a blatant partisan attack. They released a statement arguing that Naschek\u2019s \u201cframing inherently privileges white identity.\u201d On Twitter, Daniel Denvir, host of Jacobin\u2019s The Dig podcast, called the review \u201cclass reductionism of sort that I hoped only existed in liberal identitarians\u2019 caricatures of the left.\u201d Adolph Reed Jr., a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who helped Naschek craft her review, blasted Haider\u2019s arguments on a Marxist podcast, saying they \u201csmell like a truckload of rotten fish.\u201d East Bay DSA\u2019s Jeremy Gong also came to Naschek\u2019s defense in an article claiming the workplace to be the \u201cprimary strategic site of class struggle.\u201d\n\nR.L. Stephens, a former member of DSA\u2019s National Political Committee, argued that framing issues of racial justice in moral terms made these issues \u201ceither subordinate to or outside of class struggle itself.\u201d* Haider himself penned a long, philosophical response to Naschek\u2019s review. His book, he wrote, was \u201cnot a political platform, but a work of theory.\u201d (He did, however, get in a jab: \u201cNaschek dismissively proclaims that the [Combahee River Collective] was not a mass movement. Neither is the DSA.\u201d) When I spoke to Haider, he lamented the idea that \u201cthere are two isolable, discrete phenomenon that can be parceled out into race and class.\u201d\n\nWhat seemed to be a drawn-out exercise in academic hair-splitting, however, revealed profoundly different approaches to organizing a mass movement, particularly around issues of race. \u201cA lot of it is postulating more than it is significant differences on the left within DSA,\u201d said Jack Suria Linares, also a National Political Committee member. \u201cBut I also think that in the long run those differences might grow.\u201d\n\nThe essay sparked a heated, sometimes nasty intellectual debate, often conducted in the kind of dogmatic jargon that was once a hallmark of Marxist academia.\n\nThese ideological clashes, usually pitting DSA leadership against rank-and-file membership, have been largely limited to East Bay and Philadelphia, the only two major chapters in the country run by the Momentum caucus, a subgroup described in a 2017 Nation profile as the \u201cmost explicitly Marxist\u201d within the organization, with a heavy focus on the campaign for Medicare-for-All. Momentum leaders pride themselves on a precise and strategic, if narrow, political vision. While DSA members in other chapters can form working groups to take on autonomous initiatives, that behavior is heavily regulated in the two Momentum-run chapters.\n\nIn public and private, DSA members in the East Bay and Philadelphia have expressed frustration at leadership. In October 2017, ahead of a meeting to vote on the endorsement of candidates for local office in Oakland, two East Bay DSA members prepared a statement demanding more agency. \u201cTo date, when members have proposed to do work outside of single payer, we have been told that the organization does not have the bandwidth or capacity,\u201d they wrote.\n\nIn one notable dispute, a brake light repair initiative in the East Bay DSA was flatly rejected by the chapter\u2019s co-chairs, who refused to put it up for a vote. The repair clinics first sprouted in New Orleans as a strategy to combat police brutality, as people of color are often pulled over for problems as innocuous as broken taillights. These traffic stops can even lead to\u2014as in the case of Philando Castile\u2014killings by the police. While DSA chapters across the country soon began replicating the program, and embraced it as an effective way to build a stronger working-class base, East Bay leadership remained strongly resistant to the campaign. In a private conversation, one East Bay co-chair insinuated to a member of color organizing the clinic that it would look like \u201cwhite saviorism.\u201d A former member of the chapter\u2019s leadership referred to it as \u201ccharity\u201d in a blog post.\n\nIn response, over 300 DSA members\u2014a third of whom identified as people of color\u2014from across the country signed a petition urging East Bay leadership to reconsider. \u201cWe are alarmed by what increasingly feels like the erasure of our voices and presence within the DSA,\u201d they wrote. Weeks later, East Bay members collected nearly 100 signatures from their chapter, enough to bring the initiative to a vote at a general meeting. Despite protests from some DSA leaders, the resolution passed.\n\nMomentum\u2019s centralized approach stands in stark contrast to the emphasis on mutual aid and direct action in most chapters across the country. Bianca Cunningham, who co-chairs the New York City chapter and helped found DSA\u2019s Afrosocialist caucus, agrees with Momentum leaders like Naschek and Gong that universal policies like Medicare-for-All and free higher education would disproportionately benefit people of color, but argues that they are not sold that way by the mostly white membership rallying behind them. \u201cYou have to take that extra step,\u201d she said, \u201cand do more to engage with that community specifically around their own needs and experiences.\u201d\n\nHowever, the idea that racial justice is a subsidiary issue to class, one exploited by liberal politicians for cynical gain, is common on the left. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial that we not let our best impulses be weaponized against our interests,\u201d Briahna Joy Gray wrote in The Intercept, criticizing politicians like Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina who opposed free college tuition on the grounds that it would hurt historically black colleges and universities. Gray also cited the example of Hillary Clinton, who, in a dig at Bernie Sanders during the 2016 presidential primaries, asked, \u201cIf we broke up the big banks tomorrow ... would that end racism?\u201d\n\nDSA members are understandably wary of such entreaties, which end up pitting working-class people against each other. But the interests of race and class often cross in unexpected ways. Weeks after the East Bay DSA\u2019s July meeting ended in chaos, Cat Brooks submitted a formal endorsement request to the chapter. An electoral subcommittee discovered that, from 2011 to 2014, Brooks had served on the board of GO Public Schools, a pro-charter school nonprofit that has led efforts to destabilize teachers\u2019 unions and promote education privatization in and around the city. Brooks\u2019s critics had found their smoking gun.\n\nMembers flooded the DSA\u2019s website with statements and articles urging people to vote against her endorsement. Charter schools, which are publicly owned but privately operated, have had a uniquely destructive effect on Oakland. The city has the highest concentration of charters in the state, which, according to a recent report, has cost the Oakland Unified School District $57 million in funding every year. \u201cI believe in public education. I believe in democratic socialism,\u201d wrote one member in her statement. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that Cat Brooks is right for EBDSA.\u201d\n\nBut Brooks had changed her position, and had even told DSA that she supported \u201ca moratorium on charter schools\u201d in Oakland.** Still, DSA members remained unconvinced. Meagan Day, a staff writer for Jacobin and an influential East Bay DSA member, wrote that Brooks\u2019s new position was \u201cfantastic. ... But how can we be certain?\u201d The reversal, she argued, was \u201ctoo last-minute to constitute a meaningful political transformation.\u201d On September 9, East Bay DSA voted against endorsing her.\n\nThe actual story of Brooks\u2019s \u201cpolitical transformation\u201d is more nuanced. Mike Hutchinson, Oakland\u2019s loudest anti-charter activist, who described his relationship with Brooks as \u201ccomplicated,\u201d recalled that as recently as two years ago, people were calling him \u201ccrazy\u201d for his position against charter schools. When charters first began popping up in Oakland in the 1990s, they were sold to residents as a way to give them agency over their own schools. \u201cIt was tied into the self empowerment theme that goes back to the Black Panthers,\u201d he said. It was only recently that public opinion shifted, and Brooks\u2019s evolution was representative of that. When she reached out to Hutchinson to consult on her education platform, he was \u201chappily surprised on how she moved away from the charter connections she had in the past.\u201d He ultimately signed on.\n\nThe growth of DSA, especially in urban areas, has brought with it a similar set of complications. As of last year, the organization was roughly 90 percent white and composed of people mostly under 35, a palette often associated with gentrification in areas like Oakland, Philadelphia, and New York City. (When I asked DSA for updated numbers, I was told they are not currently collecting demographic data.) It\u2019s a demographic makeup that can be off-putting and even intimidating to leftists of color, many of whom have left DSA or declined to join in the first place. When Cunningham would bring her socialist friends of color to DSA meetings, they would feel uncomfortable. \u201cI would beg them to stay,\u201d she said. She remembered telling them, \u201c\u2018If you don\u2019t stay, then the next people are going to come in and they\u2019re going to say the same thing.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a demographic makeup that can be off-putting and even intimidating to leftists of color, many of whom have left DSA or declined to join in the first place.\n\nMost leftists agree that, despite the DSA\u2019s overwhelming whiteness, it is committed to recruiting candidates of color like Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez. But such efforts can also border on tokenism. When I spoke with the mostly white members of East Bay DSA\u2019s leadership, some pointed out that, during their July meeting, an older member said this after Brooks stormed out: \u201cIf we don\u2019t endorse her, what will black people think of us?\u201d\n\nOnline, the debate about race can be particularly alienating to minorities. It is a space where small, intellectualized differences are made insurmountable, and where naked ideology sometimes supersedes the lived experience of organizers who have dedicated their lives to lifting up working-class people. \u201cAn organization like DSA might benefit from the kinds of racial sensitivity trainings that we hear about because those are real tendencies that have to get checked,\u201d said Shaun Scott, a DSA member in Seattle. This is particularly true for Momentum, which has an outsized presence within DSA. The group\u2019s modus operandi is predicated on a top-down structure; general meetings are infrequent and subcommittees are limited in their scope. Though small, the group is highly ambitious while also being dismissive of its critics, an attitude seemingly incompatible with DSA\u2019s identity as a \u201cmulti-tendency\u201d organization.\n\nOn the ground, these battles tend to be fought by proxy, through debates over organizing strategy. Disputes over brake light initiatives and canvassing for Medicare-for-All often have a racial subtext, and tensions between members and the communities they live in can be heightened by DSA\u2019s prescriptive, dismissive attitudes. \u201cAs DSA, as relatively new kids on the block, as this predominantly white organization, it\u2019s really paramount that we do that solidarity work,\u201d said Shanti Singh, a co-chair of DSA\u2019s San Francisco chapter, who was one of the signatories on the brake light petition.\n\nDespite DSA\u2019s anti-racist positions, many socialists of color believe there still hasn\u2019t been a full reckoning when it comes to issues of race, nor a resolution between the beliefs of certain socialists and the world we live in. The urgency felt by activists of color doesn\u2019t always exist in white spaces, noted Kristian Hernandez, a 29-year-old Latina DSA member in Texas. In November, two weeks after a gunman killed 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, the Proud Boys, a far-right chauvinist group, had planned a demonstration in Philadelphia, which was scheduled during the same time as the local DSA chapter\u2019s general meeting. The organization\u2019s South Jersey chapter had canceled its general meeting to join counter-protesters, but in an email, the Philadelphia chapter\u2019s co-chairs, Melissa Naschek and Scott Jenkins, urged members to attend the meeting instead, to make quorum, calling the protesters \u201cfar-right LARPers,\u201d a reference to people who dress up as fictional characters. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be distracted by their theatrics,\u201d they wrote. \u201cInstead, we should push ahead with our collective goals.\u201d\n\nThe decision drew scorn from other socialist leaders. \u201cCountering right-wing anti-Semitism should not be a contentious issue,\u201d Singh tweeted. Ultimately, it\u2019s that attitude of downplaying discrimination, a perspective rooted in privilege, that worries leftists of color. They still need assurances that \u201cat the end of the day, if push comes to shove, people are going to have my back,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cParticularly white people.\u201d\n\n*A previous version of this article misstated R.L. Stephens\u2019s relationship to DSA. He\u2019s a former member of the National Political Committee, not a current one.\n\n**A previous version of this article misstated when Cat Brooks updated her website platform on charter schools. Brooks notified DSA members of her change in position before the September 9 meeting, but updated her website afterwards."

In The Daily Beast, Republican political consultant Rick Wilson described Mattis\u2019s exit as \u201ctraumatic,\u201d writing that he \u201cwas a talisman for the Washington and international foreign-policy communities, a point of smarts and stability, a ground-wire to short out Trump\u2019s capricious impulses before they could damage America\u2019s interests and values.\u201d Even Mitch McConnell seemed rattled, sending out an uncharacteristically blunt statement.\n\nMy statement on Secretary Mattis pic.twitter.com/0n6Hye3096 \u2014 Leader McConnell (@senatemajldr) December 21, 2018\n\nMattis was viewed by Trump\u2019s critics and allies alike as an essential guardrail, someone who could restrain Trump\u2019s worst instincts and advocate for the national interest. Mattis, along with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, former national security adviser H. R. McMaster, former economic adviser Gary Cohn, departing chief-of-staff John Kelly, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, was a member of what Axios dubbed the \u201cCommittee to Save America\u201d\u2014the group who viewed \u201ctheir successes mostly in terms of bad decisions prevented, rather than accomplishments chalked up.\u201d But, as the last two years have shown, having an \u201cadult in the room\u201d has rarely made much of a difference.\n\n\n\nMattis endeared himself to Trump for two primary reasons. The first was that his nickname\u2014\u201cMad Dog\u201d\u2014led Trump to believe that he was bloodthirsty and reckless. The second was his hawkish stance on Iran\u2014he had, after all, been fired from the Obama administration for advocating for war with Iran. Over the course of his two years as secretary of defense, he was repeatedly vexed by Trump\u2019s handling of America\u2019s alliances, particularly with countries in Europe and Asia, and his advice on Russia and the Iran deal went unheeded. He did convince Trump not to pull out of Afghanistan, but it appears that the president is on the cusp of doing just that. At the same time, Mattis went along with the administration\u2019s draconian family separation policy and Trump\u2019s decision to send 5,000 active-duty troops to the border as an election stunt (which Mattis defended as \u201chumanitarian\u201d) and was seemingly incapable of doing anything to influence Trump\u2019s profoundly reckless approach to North Korea.\n\n\n\nAs the Trump administration progressed, and particularly as Trump surrounded himself with more like-minded advisers, like Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, Mattis\u2019s influence began to wane. By the fall, it was clear that he was on his way out; reports began circulating that he was planning to retire, while Trump told The New York Times that he thought that Mattis was \u201csort of a Democrat.\u201d Whatever was said in private, Mattis was unable to prevent Trump from damaging alliances and creating diplomatic chaos. Ultimately, the decision to resign came after Trump decided to pull out of Syria, a reasonable decision being carried out in typically reckless fashion.\n\n"

    "text": "German critical theorist Theodor Adorno argued in the early twentieth century that true freedom in an unjust world is an impossibility. At the time, the global economy he and his contemporaries were critiquing was less developed than it would become. Today, the complex, globally interconnected nature of modern capitalist markets means that even mundane, everyday purchases can make us involuntary participants in the oppression of others.\n\nTheodor Adorno would not have seen the letter from Masanjia, implicating a mother putting up decorations in slave labor, as an anomaly.\n\nTheodor Adorno would not have seen the letter from Masanjia, implicating a mother putting up decorations in slave labor, as an anomaly. He and his contemporaries in the so-called Frankfurt School of interdisciplinary intellectuals in the 1930s saw such phenomena as fundamental to the very character of a modern, capitalist market. As individuals puzzled by the absence of a revolution within capitalist societies that Marx had predicted, and, later, by the establishment of death camps in a supposedly \u201cenlightened\u201d society, one of their fundamental interests was human agency and responsibility. Struggling to explain both phenomena, they started to focus not on individuals as the locus of responsibility for such events (or their absence), but on the ways in which institutional and societal structures condition and curtail human agency.\n\nThose raised long after Auschwitz might, at first glance, struggle to share the excessive pessimism about the limits of human agency of a critic personally targeted by the German police and forced to flee his homeland. Surely today, we might think, in Western liberal democracies, people do have genuine agency. But for Adorno, the kind of freedom we enjoy today is merely of a formal kind, one that leaves us feeling powerless. Free-market ideology, for instance, suggests we can act on our own self-interests and buy what we want (as long as we can afford it) without anyone getting in our way. And yet advertising and innovation play a huge role in determining what our desires and needs are in the first place. I never wanted to own a smart phone before they were invented, but now owning one seems almost a necessity for functioning in contemporary urban life. If you have little control over what your desires and needs are, can you really be said to be free?\n\nThere is also a second way in which Adorno thought that having formal freedom does not amount to being truly free. Being free implies having moral responsibility, Adorno mused. But if you can\u2019t be reasonably held morally responsible for your actions, he argued, then you weren\u2019t really free in the first place. And according to Adorno \u201c[w]e can only think of ourselves as responsible in so far as we are able to influence matters in the areas where we have responsibility.\u201d\n\nThinking back to the letter from Masanjia case, it seems clear that one could not reasonably be held responsible for purchasing goods that were the product of forced labor, because there is no way in which, under ordinary circumstances, a consumer could have known the precise conditions under which the goods were produced. Worse, perhaps, even when we do know that the products we buy might be the result of morally objectionable practices, it seems there is little we can do about it. It\u2019s certainly unclear whether we can really have any influence over the unjust incarceration of a religious minority in a far-away country, or the practice of enforced labor in Chinese prisons. And as Adorno recognized, according to the logic of a capitalist free market, it is in our interest to buy the best goods at the cheapest prices, which often means at the expense of those who produced the goods. If we are part of a market system that incentivizes us to purchase goods whose origins we can\u2019t be sure of, that might be morally dubious, and over which we have no real influence, then, according to Adorno, we are not truly free. In an unjust world, it is not always possible to do the right thing."

    "text": "It would be two years and two more serious romances on her part before Hepburn publicly partnered with Hughes, shortly before she was infamously blasted as \u201cbox office poison.\u201d The gossip columns latched onto the story of \u201cthe damsel in distress rescued by a dashing aviator,\u201d but they were more alike, and more equal, than that. Hepburn was, like Hughes, something of a daredevil and a germophobe; she was also wealthy in her own right, and carefully guarded her privacy. The romance worked for them both: It suggested that Hughes could be attracted to a sharp and smart woman, and it helped affirm Hepburn\u2019s heterosexuality, which was frequently called into question, mostly due to her outspokenness, love of pants, and living with a female roommate.\n\nIn 1938, Hughes completed a record-breaking round-the-world flight, becoming \u201cthe most famous man in the world\u201d\u2014and newspapers everywhere speculated on whether he would propose. In fact, he had, more than once, but Hepburn turned him down. Shortly afterwards, she met Spencer Tracy, the love of the rest of her life. After his death, Hepburn burnished her relationship with Tracy as the ultimate Hollywood romance\u2014but during his lifetime, and the nine films they made together, the relationship stayed secret, as Tracy was married. That meant that for a long time Hughes was Hepburn\u2019s highest-profile romance. Again and again, Longworth\u2019s book shows that power in Hollywood depends on who\u2019s in charge of the story.\n\nThe roster of famous names with whom Hughes was paired throughout the 1930s and 1940s is seemingly endless, but it represents only a fraction of Hughes\u2019s voracious appetite for women. Those high-profile actresses\u2014silent star Billie Dove, Jean Harlow, Ava Gardner, Ginger Rogers, Ingrid Bergman, Jane Russell, and many others\u2014managed to carve out a modicum of power for themselves in a ruthless business largely through their romantic relationships. A powerful man, a director or producer or costar, could become a husband or a lover, and serve as a protector. At the same time, as Jane Russell learned from director Howard Hawks on the set of Hughes\u2019s The Outlaw, an actress \u201cneeded to learn how to set limits, and enforce them.\u201d Male protection could only go so far. Sometimes, a woman had to defend herself\u2014as Ava Gardner did after a beating from Hughes, by striking him in the face with a heavy bronze ornament. The MGM \u201cfixers,\u201d dispatched to clean up the messes of the studio\u2019s valuable assets, made it clear to Gardner that it was she, not her violent boyfriend, who was in the wrong. But she had her limits, and the fight ended her affair with Hughes.\n\nAva Gardner with Hughes in 1946 Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nHughes\u2019s so-called \u201cwomanizing\u201d was at once totally standard for his time, and deeply weird. There were people who said he was impotent, several who thought he was gay, and those who said\u2014like Hepburn\u2014that he was the best lover they ever had. But at some point in the early 1940s, Hughes\u2019s tastes calcified. He no longer wanted stars, or even starlets: He wanted clones. Longworth identifies Russell as Hughes\u2019s \u201cphysical ideal\u201d from this point on: \u201cBig breasts, brunette, high drama.\u201d As he got older, his girlfriends stayed the same age. These teenagers rarely got the chance to make a movie, or to establish themselves independently. Hughes would choose them, lure them to Hollywood, sign them to personal contracts, and set them up in a hotel or an apartment where his extensive network of aides and spies would occupy their days and police their nights. It was a perverse kind of wooing that consisted mainly in keeping them waiting, and it\u2019s shocking how many put up with it, as did their parents.\n\nIn a patriarchal cattle market, Hughes knew the power of a marriage proposal, and he threw them around like he threw money, proposing relentlessly to most of the women in his orbit, holding out a figurative diamond ring (or often a literal one) as part of a transaction of virginity. The girls had been raised to assume that a proposal was a kind of binding contract, but Hughes, whose entire life was a dance of contracts, knew it was not. He married twice, first to Ella Rice, a Texan heiress, when he was nineteen (whom he shed as soon as he moved to Hollywood to make movies), and late in life to actress Jean Peters, who lived with him only briefly and barely saw him, as he became more and more reclusive.\n\nBut he also convinced devout Mormon Terry Moore that a ceremony conducted on a yacht and recorded in a ship\u2019s log was legally binding, mostly so she would sleep with him\u2014and after his death, Moore would devote years to insisting that she had actually married Hughes and was owed a cut of his estate. Hughes spent his life defying the forces\u2014matrimony, taxes, family, gravity\u2014that governed the lives of most ordinary people. Clearly he got off on controlling women, but what that means isn\u2019t quite clear. If a beautiful wife is a trophy, or a \u201cbillboard\u201d (as Longworth puts it in her account of the Ava Gardner movie The Barefoot Contessa, which she sees as presenting a version of the actress\u2019s relationship with Hughes), it remains mysterious what victory Hughes wanted to celebrate, or what message he was trying to send.\n\nIt makes sense that when Hughes retreated from the world, he went into the movies: renting out screening rooms around town for months at a time, hiring a projectionist to run, over and over again, his favorite movies, with his favorite girls. Even though he owned his own studio, RKO, he spent months in a room on the Samuel Goldwyn lot, until he learned that it had been used by the predominantly black cast of Otto Preminger\u2019s Porgy and Bess, and abandoned it. His racism, Longworth argues, was tied up with his germophobia; it was a visceral, irrational fear that went far beyond the common prejudices of the time.\n\nBecause most people in town respected the sanctity of a movie theater while the film was running, he could hide out from all the people he didn\u2019t want to see: his wife, his other women, his staff, his shareholders. He ate barely anything, swallowed and later injected codeine and Valium, and sat naked in front of a movie screen, taking the hypnotic magic of cinema to its most screwed-up extreme. Something similar happens when we lose ourselves in the story of Howard Hughes\u2014the outside world recedes to a muffled distance. Wars happen and enrich the millionaire further through his manufacturing contracts with the government. American society takes a sharp, stifling turn toward domesticity and conformity in the 1950s and that also benefits him, by confirming his vision of women as the domesticated playthings of powerful men.\n\nThere is no doubt some schadenfreude lurking in the fascination with Hughes, as there is in any story about a powerful man\u2019s slow slide out of public life into a private hell of his own making. The legend that lingers in American culture, and the version portrayed by DiCaprio, is of \u201ceccentricity\u201d grown unmanageable, as Hughes barricaded himself first in studio screening rooms, then hotel suites, for weeks and months at a time. His hair and fingernails grew long and filthy, he touched nothing without a protective Kleenex, and grew dependent on painkillers. Throughout the 1960s until his death in 1976, he moved between the Bahamas, Nicaragua, Las Vegas, and other American cities, between hotels that he would sometimes buy to ensure his privacy. An entourage of staff insulated him from the world. The man retreated into myth.\n\nIt is tempting to shuffle possible, posthumous diagnoses of Hughes, whether they\u2019re cultural or medical: head trauma from one too many plane crashes; undiagnosed epilepsy (perhaps the cause of all those crashes); secret syphilis; that hypochondriac mother. But as Longworth makes clear, a focus on \u201cwhat went wrong\u201d in his later years requires that we see the younger Hughes as basically decent and healthy\u2014and it\u2019s only possible to do that if we think it\u2019s really no big deal to scout young women as though the entire world is a catalog, and then, essentially, to purchase and imprison them. In other words, if we celebrate megalomania and gilded male privilege run amok as quintessential American values.\n\nHollywood\u2019s post-Weinstein reckoning with the entertainment industry\u2019s treatment of women suggests that those values can be questioned. Longworth\u2019s essential book reclaims the narrative from a man who obsessively sought to control it and from the many other men who benefited. She reminds us that abuses of power might be common, but they should not be routine. Instead, they need to be called out and protested, over and over again. Listening to women is a start."

    "authors": [
      "Matt Ford"
    ],
    "text": "Australia\u2019s woeful defamation laws have even allowed Sydney to seize, from London, the title of \u201clibel capital of the world.\u201d Britain was notorious for its weak libel protections before Parliament heightened its standards in 2013. The Sydney Morning Herald reported last year that the Australian province of New South Wales, which includes Sydney, sees as many defamation lawsuits as England and Wales, which has eight times the population. Yael Stone, an actress who came forward this month with similar allegations against Rush, recently told the Times\u2019 Bari Weiss that she feared going public because of the potential legal hazards.\n\nAustralia\u2019s aversion to press freedom extends beyond libel laws. Earlier this month, a local court convicted Cardinal George Pell on five counts related to sexual-abuse charges that span decades. Pell, one of the most senior Catholic clergy ever accused of sexual abuse, was a prominent Vatican figure and a close adviser of Pope Francis until the allegations became public. His conviction was, by any definition, a major news story.\n\nBut Australian media outlets were barred by a judicial order from publishing any details about Pell\u2019s conviction. The result was surreal: Australian media outlets either obliquely referred to the conviction of an unnamed person, or simply chose not to report the news at all. The Daily Telegraph responded by publishing a front page that read \u201cIT\u2019S THE NATION\u2019S BIGGEST STORY\u201d with no other description of what happened and an editorial denouncing the state of affairs. Thanks to social media, many Australians were able to learn what happened, rendering the entire state of affairs even more absurd.\n\nEven foreign news outlets with reporters in Australia are affected. The New York Times published an unusual article on the quandary and its implications last week, all without mentioning any names. \u201cThe Times is not publishing the latest news of the case online, and it blocked delivery of the Friday print edition to Australia, to comply with the judge\u2019s order,\u201d reporter Damien Cave wrote. \u201cThe Times\u2019s lawyers in Australia have advised the organization that it is subject to local law because it maintains a bureau in the country.\u201d (The New Republic does not have an Australian bureau.)\n\nCave noted that Australian officials defend orders like these on the idea that suppressing media coverage is necessary to insulate potential jurors from bias. Pell, for instance, is expected to face more criminal trials in Australia related to the allegations against him. The American judicial system has much greater faith than its Australian counterpart in the average person\u2019s ability to render a verdict based on the evidence presented to them in open court. In extraordinary circumstances, a U.S. judge could simply order the jury to be sequestered for the duration of the trial. Depriving a handful of jurors of the free press is far preferable to depriving a nation of it.\n\nPress-freedom cases and legal thresholds for libel lawsuits aren\u2019t the sexiest topics in the world, but they play a profound and often invisible impact on a democratic society. They afford the less powerful members of society a measure of protection from the litigious whims of the wealthy and the well-connected. They help make possible a public discourse in which allegations of wrongdoing can be made without fear of reprisal and bankruptcy. And they tilt the playing field away from those who are most likely to abuse it.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that Trump is the foremost opponent of America\u2019s libel laws. His public and private life are defined by unsavory behaviors: allegations of tax evasion and consumer fraud, accounts of sexual misconduct by at least nineteen women, hush-money payments for two alleged extramarital affairs, and more. Trump has a lot to hide, and he\u2019s lamented his inability to hide it. But because the nation\u2019s libel laws are written at the state level and shaped by Supreme Court precedents, the president has virtually no power to change them.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t dissuaded him from threatening to do so. \u201cWe\u2019re going to open up those libel laws,\u201d he told supporters on the campaign trail. \u201cSo when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace or when The Washington Post, which is there for other reasons, writes a hit piece, we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they\u2019re totally protected.\u201d His frustration is a high compliment for the American approach to libel and press freedom, and a good example of why Australians should rethink theirs."

We decided to look back at rhetorical wars of the past, from Lyndon Johnson\u2019s war on poverty to Rick Santorum\u2019s war on pornography.\n\nWar on Poverty. President Lyndon Johnson in his 1964 State of the Union address declared \u201cunconditional war on poverty in America.\u201d As part of his Great Society programs, the War on Poverty\u2014as it was unofficially known\u2014sought to address the high poverty rate in America, which was near 19 percent at the time. Johnson laid out his proposals to the joint session of Congress using martial rhetoric to describe the efforts needed to combat poverty.\n\nWar on Hunger. In a 1966 special message to Congress, Johnson proposed that \u201cthe United States lead the world in a war against hunger.\u201d Johnson\u2019s message detailed a program designed to provide food and foreign aid to other countries and also improve food domestic food production.\n\nWar on Drugs. The much maligned \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d was coined by Richard Nixon in June, 1971 to apply to his creation of a national anti-drug policy. Identifying drugs as \u201cPublic Enemy Number 1,\u201d he created the DEA to coordinate the enforcement efforts of other agencies in eradicating illegal drug use."

Last week, the Associated Press reported that Biden\u2019s advisers have discussed the possibility of teaming with a younger candidate\u2014Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s name has come up\u2014to fend off concerns about the 76-year-old\u2019s age. With the 2020 Democratic National Convention more than 18 months away, such talk may seem premature. But the early months of 2019 likely will see a glut of Democrats declaring their candidacy, and Biden is poised to begin the race in pole position. He has posted sizable leads in national polling and, over the weekend, led the first poll of likely Iowa caucus-goers by a large margin.\n\nBiden is the early frontrunner for obvious reasons. He served for eight years as the vice president of Barack Obama, the most popular figure in Democratic politics, and did so with an avuncular charm that was once seen as a political liability, but has aged well under a crass president. He is also aided by the sheer size (likely several dozen candidates) and opacity (no major figures have announced their candidacy yet) of the field. He also may be benefitting from not having had any direct involvement in politics since leaving office two years ago; unlike elected Democrats, he hasn\u2019t had to make any difficult decisions or defend his response to the Trump administration. He is, in short, an elder statesman of the party, and is being treated as such.\n\n\n\nBut these benefits have significant drawbacks, all of which will begin to appear once Biden actually starts running for president, which he is expected to do. Hillary Clinton, after all, was in a very similar position in advance of the 2016 contest, having enjoyed a surge in popularity from her successful stint as President Obama\u2019s secretary of state through her retirement from public office. In 2013, polling suggested she was the most popular politician in America. But reentering politics swiftly changed that: Her favorability plummeted after she announced her race for president in 2015. This is not a perfect comparison, for reasons I\u2019ll explain, but to some degree this happens to all former politicians who rejoin the fray.\n\nWe may already have hit peak Biden, and it\u2019s all downhill from here."

Unlike senators, who serve six-year terms, representatives face reelection every two years and thus are particularly accountable to their districts; there is simply less time to mount a nationwide campaign. Congressmen also represent far smaller districts and may have less experience with broader constituencies.\n\n\u201cThey may have high approval ratings from one small subset of people,\u201d said Lara Brown, director of the Graduate Program in Political Management at George Washington University and author of Jockeying for the Presidency: The Political Opportunism of Aspirants. \u201cBut often times, their constituency is not representative of their state and certainly not of the United States as a whole.\u201d\n\nAll that can put them at a significant disadvantage in access to the daunting funds and resources needed to compete for president. \u201cA typical congressional race is essentially a glorified city council race,\u201d said Republican strategist Ken Spain. \u201cRunning for higher office requires a donor network, a sophisticated campaign team that can operate across multiple cities in multiple states, and experienced hands when it comes to strategy and execution.

Thanks to his close race against Cruz in a deep-red state, he has national name recognition and a national fundraising network. \u201cHe\u2019s unique, because he does already have this enormous grassroots fundraising energy and excitement,\u201d Mike Lux, a Democratic strategist, said in an interview. \u201cThat puts him in a very different place than a John Delaney or an Eric Swalwell.\u201d Having given up his seat to challenge Cruz, O\u2019Rourke also would have more than enough time to devote to a presidential bid.\n\nIf O\u2019Rourke ran for president and won, he would defy history. But the political environment in America today doesn\u2019t adhere to the conventional wisdom. \u201cI think you need to be a cultural phenomenon in order to win the presidency in the twenty-first century,\u201d Spain said. \u201cAnd Beto clearly has that.\u201d And if a vulgar reality TV star with no political or military experience can win the White House, it would seem downright ordinary for the next president to be a retired Democratic congressman from Texas.\n\n\n\n* A previous version of this article incorrectly described the Democratic and Republican presidential tickets in 1984, as well as William Howard Taft\u2019s margin of victory over William Jennings Bryan in the 1908 presidential election."

    "text": "According to the U.S. Postal Service, the volume of mail traffic more than doubles to 220 million letters and 6 million parcels per day the week before Christmas, battering a system already weakened by tens of millions of catalogs and advertisements during the previous two months. Telephone calls reach as high as 131 million per day in the month from Thanksgiving to New Year\u2019s Eve, according to AT&T. At many stores and post offices, there are long lines, and costly second and third shifts have to be added to handle them, which consumers ultimately pay for. All of this \u201cpeak loading\u2019\u2019 at Christmas means that airlines, mail delivery, stores, banks, warehouses, telephone systems, roads, and parking lots must be built much larger than if activities were distributed more evenly throughout the year. That wastes precious capital.\n\nChristmas destroys the environment and innocent animals and birds. These have perhaps not been traditional concerns for economists. But when one takes account of all the Christmas trees, letters, packages, increased newspaper advertising, wrapping paper, and catalogs and cards, as well as all the animals slaughtered for feast and fur, this holiday is nothing less than a catastrophe for the entire ecosystem. According to the U.S. Forest Service, 33 million Christmas trees are consumed each year. Growing them imposes an artificially short rotation period on millions of acres of forest land, and the piles of needles they shed shorten the life of most household rugs and pets. All the trees and paper have to be disposed of, which places a heavy burden on landfill sites and recycling facilities, especially in the Northeast.\n\nThis year, according to the Humane Society, at least 4 million foxes and minks will be butchered just to provide our Christmas furs. To stock our tables, the Department of Agriculture tells me, we\u2019ll also slaughter 22 million turkeys, 2 million pigs, and 2 million to 3 million cattle, plus a disproportionate fraction of the 6 billion chickens that the United States consumes each year. To anyone who has ever been to a turkey farm, Christmas and Thanksgiving take on a new and somewhat less cheerful meaning. Every single day during the run-up to these holidays, thousands of bewildered, debeaked, growth-hormone-saturated birds are hung upside down on assembly-line racks and given electric shocks. Then their throats are slit and they are dropped into boiling water.\n\nChristmas introduces sharp seasonal fluctuations into the money demand. This makes it more difficult for the Federal Reserve to cushion the crests and falls of our economy. This is the peak season for people carrying large denominations around, and currency is a popular Christmas gift mostly among employers. The volume of currency in circulation peaks each year in December, then declines by about 4 to 5 percent.\n\nChristmas leads to a sharp rise in absenteeism and a slump in labor productivity that is unlikely to be recaptured the rest of the year. Many U.S. companies shut down entirely for the two-week period from Christmas to New Year\u2019s. For those that stay open, on-the-job performance often plummets because of the season\u2019s wild parties and high jinks. Although there is no precise data on absenteeism, according to Labor Department experts, industries like manufacturing and construction are likely to have lower productivity while retailing\u2019s productivity is likely to increase.\n\nFar from being \u201cthe season to be jolly,\u2019\u2019 Christmas is really the season of sadness and despair. This period\u2019s compulsory merriment, hypercommercialism, heavy drinking, and undue media emphasis on the idealized, two-child, two-parent, orthodox Christian family makes those who don\u2019t share such lifestyles or religious sentiments feel left out, lonely, and even somewhat un-American. And even in so-called normal families, media hype about the season\u2019s merriments often raises expectations and sets up many for disappointment. According to Dr. Quita Mullen, a psychiatrist in Boston, many women in particular exhaust themselves trying to meet both the demands of full-time jobs and the more traditional expectations about what holidays are supposed to be like -- provided in part by their (non-working) mothers.\n\nThere is also a great deal of emotional stress associated with compulsory overspending and compulsory displays of affection. (Many people reportedly become highly anxious at the sight of mistletoe.) Police, psychiatrists, and hospitals all report that there is a dramatic rise in alcoholic \u201cslips,\u2019\u2019 drug overdoses, domestic quarrels, hotline calls, and emergency medical calls at this time of year. \u201cAny redolent setting can be very sad for people who don\u2019t have a dancing partner,\u2019\u2019 says Mullen. \u201cChristmas is one of those times.\u2019\u2019\n\nChristmas is one of the most hazardous times of the year. The combination of trees, lights, blazing hearths, yuletide passion, and other indoor festivities results in more household fires at this time of year than any other. The fire department in Washington, D.C., reports that fire calls in December are 40 percent above its monthly average; New York City had 2,800 residential fires last December, as compared with a 2,000-per-month average.\n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, December is the peak month for drunk driving and \u201cDWI\u2019\u2019 arrests, which last year totaled 1.8 million. Not surprisingly, it is also the peak month for accidents -- because of drunkenness, congestion, and bad weather -- with more than 460,000 last year, compared with a monthly average of only 386,000. In just the three days around Christmas last year, 374 people died on the nation\u2019s highways. The only consolation is that last year\u2019s Thanksgiving was even worse, with 402 deaths. Of course, weather is a compounding factor -- for most of us in the colder climes, life would be much easier if we could at least agree to observe Christmas in the summer, when the lutefisk is ripe.\n\nDecember is also the peak month in the United States for robberies. Last year the number reached about 54,000, according to the FBI Uniform Crime Report, and it is the second highest for auto theft, with about 136,000. Police suspect that all this property crime is because criminals too are propelled by the need to fill their family stockings. December 1989 had nearly 1,900 murders, a disproportionate share. \u201cChristmas is a crazy season,\u2019\u2019 says Sag Harbor, New York, Police Chief Joseph Ialacci. \u201cIt\u2019s a potpourri of emotional extremes -- either quiet or all hell breaks loose. There are more assaults, barroom brawls, and family altercations.\u2019\u2019\n\nExcessive eating and drinking are used to compensate for the tribulations of Christmas. According to the Distilled Spirits Council and the Department of Agriculture, in the six short weeks from Thanksgiving through New Year\u2019s, this year we will consume $18 billion of alcohol -- including 81 million gallons of hard liquor -- 1.1 billion pounds of turkey, and a huge quantity of ham, cookies, pies, eggnog, stuffing, plum pudding, and other trimmings. All this indulgence does little good for the nation\u2019s waistline: Christmas is one of the single most important contributors to obesity -- the average American consumes more than 3,500 calories at Christmas Day dinner alone. Naturally, January is the peak month for diet plans, many of which end up in failure and despair.\n\nPerhaps most important of all, from a purely distributional standpoint, Christmas almost certainly aggravates inequality, since most gift-giving takes place within the family or the same social class, and doesn\u2019t reach the people who really need our help. Salvation Army drum-beating aside, Christmas almost certainly reduces our capacity for charity by draining us of wealth that we might otherwise give to the needy, and of our charitable impulses. This is hardly what the person for whom the holiday is named had in mind.\n\nOverall, the message is clear: Christmas imposes a huge efficiency tax on our economy, is hazardous to our health and safety, and does little to further social justice. And the efficiency tax may well be growing in real terms -- an analysis of long-term changes in the seasonality of the U.S. economy suggests that the Christmas buying season has been getting longer and longer. Christmas commercialism, of course, is a modern innovation. The ancient Christians did not even observe the holiday until the fifth century, medieval Christians observed it much more modestly, and the Puritans sensibly refused to celebrate it at all. Only in the last fifty years, with the perfection of mass-market advertising and the commercialization of religion in general, has it become such a command performance.\n\nModern Christmas is like primitive Keynesianism, a short-run-oriented economic experiment that has been tried and found wanting. It is the flipside of the positive contribution the \u201cProtestant ethic\u2019\u2019 once made to capitalism -- Christianity\u2019s high holiday now almost certainly makes us feel worse off. What is to be done? I suggest an experimental two- to three-year moratorium on the whole affair, to let us pay our bills and recover some of the distance we\u2019ve lost. This may sound like tough medicine to youngsters, and to all the other interest groups that have acquired such large commercial stakes in this annual ritual -- from bulb manufacturers to ambulance drivers. But the rest of us can no longer afford it. If we celebrate this holiday at all, we should do so mainly because it is over for at least one more year.\n\nThis article appeared in the December 31, 1990, issue of the magazine."

      "Samuel Earle"
    ],
    "text": "Among other suggestions, the blueprint advocated opening up Britain\u2019s public services\u2014including education, legal services, and, eventually, health care\u2014to U.S. competition. Current EU regulations that prevent certain U.S. products from entering the British marketplace\u2014particularly rules governing food hygiene and environmental standards\u2014should be discarded, it argued, along with the EU\u2019s relatively progressive policies on workers\u2019 rights.\n\nMay\u2019s proposed deal is opposed on both sides of the Atlantic precisely because it makes such a deal impossible. Under May\u2019s plan, Britain remains tied to the EU\u2019s regulatory system, and the barriers to U.S. trade persist. Britain loses its power to influence the regulatory system (hence the \u201ccolony\u201d accusation), yet gains control of its borders\u2014for so long, Brexit\u2019s raison d\u2019etre.\n\nMay still sees strong borders as the priority. As leader of the Home Office from 2010 to 2016, she championed this cause with the cruel confidence and creativity that, in the eyes of her Conservative critics, her current leadership lacks. More recently, when the EU and Britain drew up a document regarding their future relationship, May personally insisted that \u201cthe ending of the free movement of people\u201d be placed on the first page.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear from the opposition to May\u2019s deal, however, is that for all the xenophobia incited during the referendum by the Leave campaign, border control was not the highest goal. Even Nigel Farage, whose sole concern seemed to be Britain taking back control of its borders, is unenthused by May\u2019s deal. Many other leading Brexiteers, including its main financial donors, have said that it would be better to remain inside the EU than leave on May\u2019s terms. Clearly, for the parties most invested in Brexit, the real reasons for leaving lie elsewhere.\n\nThe sad, unsolvable riddle at the heart of British politics is that, while May\u2019s deal is doomed, every other deal is too. There is simply no resolution to Brexit that can claim a majority in Parliament. The divisions are too deep, and the costs too steep for compromise. Britain is left lurching between three dramatic scenarios: a second referendum, a general election, and a no deal Brexit.\n\nThere is no guarantee that either of the first two scenarios will resolve the Brexit impasse. A no deal outcome, by contrast, definitely will\u2014it is the hard Brexit par excellence\u2014and the consequences could be severe. This is what will happen: At 11pm Greenwich Mean Time on Friday, March 29, 2019, Britain will leave the EU without any new arrangement in place. Its membership, along with 45 years of legal and institutional integration, will become void in an instant, leaving almost everything in limbo.\n\nAccording to almost every analysis, it is by far the worst of any outcome for the British economy. The uncertainty would be unprecedented; the value of the pound would plummet. Grocery stores and pharmaceutical companies have started stockpiling essential materials to prepare for havoc at the border. But in its superficial speed and simplicity\u2014overnight, the Brexit prize is brought home and EU regulations disappear\u2014it stands as a satisfying solution for many Brexiteers.\n\nUntil recently, May always said that \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal.\u201d For the Brexiteers, however, even more indifferent to the dangers, there may be no deal better than a no deal. Anything else leaves Britain tied, in some unacceptable way, to Brussels, only now with a reduced say and a \u00a337 billion divorce bill to pay. Chaos is preferred to such concessions and, in the end, may even be more fitting for the main event: Britain\u2019s day of liberation.\n\nBesides, the national fantasy, indulged by most Tories, that Brits are at their best when their backs are against the wall, gives any hardship a patriotic spin. At the Conservative Party Conference, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt invoked the \u201cDunkirk Spirit\u201d to warn the EU of who and what they were up against. Over the weekend, Hunt declared that Britain would \u201cflourish and prosper\u201d in the event of a no deal.\n\nSo even if a no deal Brexit happens exactly as the worst predictions warn, Britain can still celebrate. Brexiteers will take solace in the great spirit of British sacrifice, a sacrifice none of which will have been theirs. The queues at customs can perversely prove that Britain has taken back control of its borders, even if it is only capital that is set free. After World War II, it was sometimes joked that the British gave up rationing only reluctantly. Now, as the distant possibility of rationing returns to Britain\u2019s streets\u2014the government recently appointed a new \u201cMinister of Food Supplies\u201d to cope with potential food shortages\u2014that dormant Dunkirk spirit can be revived. Britain just needs to keep calm and carry on."

      "Michael Mcgough"
    ],
    "text": "The city regards the invocation of the public-forum doctrine in this case as bizarre. Not so Senior US. District Judge Barron McCune, who on December 20\u2014two days before the beginning of Chanukah\u2014issues a preliminary injunction forbidding the city from interfering with the erection of the menorah on the City-County Building steps. The judge stipulates that Chabad adherents will erect the display; in the past city workers did so. For good measure, the judge also orders that the menorah be accompanied by the secularizing \u201cliberty\u201d proclamation, a requirement that is hard to square with the \u201cpublic forum\u201d theory under which the menorah is Chabad\u2019s creature, not the city\u2019s. McCune, whose 1986 ruling upholding Grant Street\u2019s menorah and Nativity scene was the genesis of the Lynch v. Donnelly decision, engagingly prefaces his ruling with the comment that \u201cwhatever I decide, I will probably be reversed.\u201d\n\nHoping he is right, the city launches the sort of frenzied appeal process usually associated with death penalty cases. In one of many ironies in this affair, the appellate judge from whom the city seeks a stay of McCune\u2019s injunction is Senior Judge Joseph Weis of the 3rd US. Circuit Court of Appeals, who dissented from a 1988 3rd Circuit decision holding that both the menorah and the Nativity scene violated the establishment clause. This time Weis disappoints supporters of the menorah. On December 21 he stays McCune\u2019s order, saying, \u201cI am not convinced that this is a public forum.\u201d\n\nThe next day, in response to an appeal by Chabad, a panel of the 3rd Circuit agrees with Weis. Undaunted, Chabad asks Supreme Court Justice William Brennan, the Circuit Justice for the 3rd Circuit, to reinstate McCune\u2019s injunction preventing the city from interfering with the menorah display. On December 22 Justice Brennan obliges. His action is the second example of judicial role reversal: in the July decision Brennan voted to hold both the Nativity scene and the menorah unconstitutional.\n\nThe city promptly appeals Brennan\u2019s action to the full Supreme Court. Meanwhile, on December 26, the fourth day of Chanukah, the menorah is erected. Two days later the Court refuses the city\u2019s request to stay McCune\u2019s order. Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens and Antonin Scalia indicate that they would have granted the city\u2019s request.\n\nChabad has thus succeeded in clothing its portion of the public square, and victory is sweet. But, predictably, Christian Pittsburghers complain that \u201cour\u201d religious display (the Nativity, not the Christmas tree) is now banned from government premises but \u201ctheirs\u201d isn\u2019t. Such attitudes aren\u2019t confined to bigots or radio talkshow types. Injustice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s dissent in last summer\u2019s \u201cCreche No, Menorah Yes\u201d ruling, he peevishly asked if \u201cthose religions enjoying the largest following must be consigned to the status of least-favored faiths so as to avoid any possible risk of offending members of minority religions.\u201d\n\nThen, on the evening of December 28 someone spray-paints \u201cPLO\u201d on the \u201cSalute to Liberty\u201d proclamation that is attached to the menorah. Police say that whoever defaced the sign could be charged with ethnic intimidation and desecration of a venerated object. But wait. What the vandal defaced was not the menorah but rather a sign whose raison d\u2019etre was precisely its secular content. The anonymous scrawler could argue that he was acting on the same \u201cpublic forum\u201d theory advanced by Chabad. If the area in front of the City-County Building is open to free speech, symbolic or otherwise, why should pro-PLO propaganda be excluded?\n\nFrom this chronicle it is obvious that the combatants in Pittsburgh\u2019s menorah wars have been faithful to the spirit if not the letter of recent Supreme Court pronouncements in this area. That spirit is one of dissembling about what is really at stake in the debate over religious displays at government buildings. It is simply not credible that the religious character of a menorah or a reverent depiction of the Nativity can be subsumed in a three-ring-circus celebration of what Justice Blackmun called the \u201cwinter holiday season.\u201d And it is disingenuous to suggest that the Jews and Christians who rallied round the menorah and the Nativity respectively were motivated primarily by a concern for free speech or an open public forum. What they crave is government acknowledgment of their miracles. If all they wanted to do was gaze upon a Nativity scene or menorah in a public place, they could stroll through any of several Pittsburgh neighborhoods\u2014 or open an account at Mellon Bank.\n\nRecognizing this, the liberal and conservative wings of the Supreme Court have offered relatively coherent alternatives to the reindeer rule and us progeny. The so-called \u201caccommodationist\u201d view, held by Rehnquist. Kennedy, Scalia, and Byron White, can be traced back to Warren Burger\u2019s majority opinion in Lynch v. Donnelly. In that opinion, having likened government religious displays to Presidential proclamations marking Christmas and theJewish High Holy Days, Burger observed that the laws of religious divisiveness that gave rise to the First Amendment\u2019s religion clauses \u201care of far less concern today ... Any notion that these symbols pose a real danger of establishment of a state church is farfetched indeed.\u201d\n\nThe accomodationist view makes sense if one accepts that the only \u201cestablishment of religion\u201d proscribed by the First Amendment is the creation of a national or state church. That is too big an \u201cif\u201d for me, but there is no doubt that a triumph for the accommodationist view would discourage holiday horror shows like the litigation over the miracles on Grant Street. But so would an acceptance by the Court of the counsel of Justice Stevens in his dissent (joined by Brennan and Thurgood Marshall) in last summer\u2019s ruling: \u201cIn my opinion the Establishment Clause should be construed to create a strong presumption against the display of religious symbols on public property. There is always the risk that such symbols will offend non-members of the faith being advertised as well as adherents who consider the particular advertisement disrespectful.\u201d\n\nThe life of the law. Holmes said, has not been logic; it has been experience. Pittsburgh\u2019s experience suggests that the wiser reading of the law may be Justice Stevens\u2019s."

    "text": "``` ```\n\nA choir sings during mass in Kinshasa, where the Catholic Church has become one of the country\u2019s few effective institutions.\n\n\n\nSince the country\u2019s first prime minister was deposed and killed with U.S. and Belgian support shortly after independence, the DRC has suffered from a series of plunderous dictators. Mobutu Sese Seko, a kleptocratic ruler who enjoyed strong Western support as he changed the country\u2019s name to Zaire and implemented one-party rule, brought the nation close to bankruptcy during nearly four decades in power. The current president\u2019s father, Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila, overthrew Mobutu in 1997, but didn\u2019t usher in stability. Another war soon broke out, drawing in the entire region and killing millions through violence, starvation, and disease. In 2001, the elder Kabila was assassinated. His son Joseph, then just 29, took his place, winning elections twice, though the second vote was marred by allegations of fraud. But while the war officially ended in 2003, fighting continues, with dozens of rebel groups operating in the country and millions suffering from the violence. Conflict has hampered efforts to contain a worsening Ebola outbreak in the country\u2019s east.\n\nIn an increasingly dysfunctional state crippled by corruption and conflict, the Catholic Church has become one of the country\u2019s few effective institutions. Nearly half of the DRC\u2019s population of 80 million is Catholic, and the Church provides education and healthcare to millions. It has also long played a political role. In the twilight of Mobutu\u2019s regime in the 1990s, Church leaders participated in efforts to reform the government and chart a path toward a democratic transition. When Mobutu resisted, a group of Catholic activists known as the Lay Coordination Committee (known by the French acronym CLC) organized a massive protest in support of reform, assembling at the same St. Joseph parish where the group gathered in August. The army attacked that protest, killing dozens.\n\nSurvivors of a Catholic activist killed in protests on December 31, 2017. At least 18 people were killed in demonstrations over three months calling for the end of President Joseph Kabila\u2019s rule. John Wessels/AFP/Getty\n\nIn late 2016, the country\u2019s conference of bishops negotiated a deal between Kabila and the opposition, known as the St. Sylvester Accord, in which the president agreed to hold a vote to choose his successor by December 2017. That election never happened. In response, Catholic activists resurrected the CLC and called for nationwide protests against Kabila\u2019s power grab. Thousands of the faithful answered the call in three protests in December 2017, January 2018, and February 2018, spilling out of parishes from Kinshasa to Goma after services and taking to the streets. Security forces met them with tear gas and bullets, killing at least 18 people and wounding dozens more. But the pressure worked, protests within and strong diplomatic pressure from without leading to Kabila\u2019s August announcement.\n\nIn some places, such explicit political intervention by a religious institution would draw cries of protest. For Father Joseph Musubao, an assistant priest at St. Fran\u00e7ois de Sales parish in Kinshasa, however, it is the Church\u2019s duty to oppose a regime that is causing God\u2019s people to suffer. During his January 21 homily ahead of the second of the CLC\u2019s three protests, he told his congregation that the church had three tasks: to announce the good news of the gospel, to denounce evil, and to reject corrupt powers. In the eyes of the round-faced priest, that mission didn\u2019t just justify the protests, but nearly compelled Christians to take part. \u201cThey have to put into practice the gospel we are preaching to them,\u201d he told me, \u201cthe gospel which says that a person created by God should live happily on this earth, and that the wealth and resources that God has given to every nation should be shared equally and should not belong to a minority that takes millions of people hostage.\u201d\n\nFather Joseph Musubao called on his parishioners to participate in the January 2018 street protests, which were attacked by armed police.\n\nDespite the violent crackdown on a protest weeks earlier, at least a thousand people gathered in the parish yard after his sermon, singing as they marched out the gate. They made it no further than the steps, Musubao told me, when the police stationed outside fired a volley of tear gas. The crowd retreated into the parish compound, but soon a police vehicle appeared at the gate, and an officer leapt to the gun mounted on top. He fired into the crowd. The bullets struck Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Dechade Kapangala, an aspiring nun and Musubao\u2019s niece. She died instantly."

    "text": "Many people mistakenly believe that the one true symbol of the American Christmas is Santa Claus. These people are wrong. Sure, every mall worth its Auntie Anne\u2019s salt has a Saint Nick in the food court. Yes, he\u2019s in every seasonal advertisement. Your kid might have learned his name before yours. And yeah, the most seductive Christmas song of all time was written for the big guy. But if you really want to understand the spirit of our country around the holidays, consider the Elf. (Sorry, baby Jesus.)\n\nI\u2019m not talking about the mystical, woodland dwellers from The Hobbit or in German mythology. Nor am I talking about the Keebler elf, though you might encounter some of his product at a family party or two this season. The Christmas elf is a distinct creature, jolly and green and generous. Elves have been part of the seasonal mythology in Europe for far longer than on these shores (in Iceland and Scandinavia they bring presents; the Greeks, ever tragic, are beset by elves who pop up between Christmas and Epiphany for the main purpose of frightening people).\n\nThe American version of the Christmas elf\u2014 the one who lives at the North Pole cobbling together toys\u2014emerged sometime in the mid 19th century. The exact origins are somewhat murky (some credit Louisa May Alcott), but by 1857, Harper\u2019s had published a Christmas poem with the lines \u201cIn his house upon the top of a hill/And almost out of sight/ He keeps a great many elves at work/ All working with all their might/ To make a million of pretty things/Cakes, sugar-plums, and toys.\u201d It was, after all, a time of bustling manufacturing in the United States, a state of affairs that would only increase over the next century or so, alongside the elf\u2019s place in our holiday mythology. The modern Christmas is a paean to capitalism, American-style (and has been since long before people were trampled outside Wal-Marts on Black Friday), and capitalism is nothing without its happy, industrious workers producing goods. Every Santa needs his helper, just as every Henry Ford needed his factory workers.\n\nThen came the 1960s, and Hermey the Misfit Elf. Not everyone is cut out to be a cog in the wheel, man, as the country realized en masse not long after the now-classic television special Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, featuring Hermey, aired in 1964. Hermey dreamed of following his own path (dentistry: rugged individualism doesn\u2019t always have rebellious trappings), and left the North Pole to pursue it, just as America\u2019s youth began to realize that they wanted to join the Peace Corps or move to the Haight or learn to woodwork in Colorado instead of dropping their resume off with IBM."

    "text": "So because these ideas and traditions had a lengthy history, Nazi propagandists were able to easily cast Christmas as a celebration of pagan German nationalism. A vast state apparatus (centered in the Nazi Ministry for Propaganda and Enlightenment) ensured that a Nazified holiday dominated public space and celebration in the Third Reich.\n\nBut two aspects of the Nazi version of Christmas were relatively new.\n\nA Christmas-themed stamp emphasizes light. Author provided\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, because Nazi ideologues saw organized religion as an enemy of the totalitarian state, propagandists sought to deemphasize\u2014or eliminate altogether\u2014the Christian aspects of the holiday. Official celebrations might mention a supreme being, but they more prominently featured solstice and \u201clight\u201d rituals that supposedly captured the holiday\u2019s pagan origins.\n\nSecond, as Hitler\u2019s 1921 speech suggests, Nazi celebration evoked racial purity and anti-Semitism. Before the Nazis took power in 1933, ugly and open attacks on German Jews typified holiday propaganda.\n\nBlatant anti-Semitism more or less disappeared after 1933, as the regime sought to stabilize its control over a population tired of political strife, though Nazi celebrations still excluded those deemed \u201cunfit\u201d by the regime. Countless media images of invariably blond-haired, blue-eyed German families gathered around the Christmas tree helped normalize ideologies of racial purity.\n\nOpen anti-Semitism nonetheless cropped up at Christmastime. Many would boycott Jewish-owned department stores. And the front cover of a 1935 mail order Christmas catalog, which pictured a fair-haired mother wrapping Christmas presents, included a sticker assuring customers that \u201cthe department store has been taken over by an Aryan!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a small, almost banal example. But it speaks volumes. In Nazi Germany, even shopping for a gift could naturalize anti-Semitism and reinforce the \u201csocial death\u201d of Jews in the Third Reich.\n\nThe message was clear: only \u201cAryans\u201d could participate in the celebration.\n\nTaking the \u2018Christ\u2019 out of Christmas\n\nAccording to National Socialist theorists, women\u2014particularly mothers\u2014were crucial for strengthening the bonds between private life and the \u201cnew spirit\u201d of the German racial state.\n\nEveryday acts of celebration\u2014wrapping presents, decorating the home, cooking \u201cGerman\u201d holiday foods and organizing family celebrations\u2014were linked to a cult of sentimental \u201cNordic\u201d nationalism.\n\nChristmas tree bulbs featuring the swastika were only one of a number of ways that Christmas became Nazified. Author provided\n\n\n\n\n\nPropagandists proclaimed that as \u201cpriestess\u201d and \u201cprotector of house and hearth,\u201d the German mother could use Christmas to \u201cbring the spirit of the German home back to life.\u201d The holiday issues of women\u2019s magazines, Nazified Christmas books and Nazi carols tinged conventional family customs with the ideology of the regime.\n\n\n\nThis sort of ideological manipulation took everyday forms. Mothers and children were encouraged to make homemade decorations shaped like \u201cOdin\u2019s Sun Wheel\u201d and bake holiday cookies shaped like a loop (a fertility symbol). The ritual of lighting candles on the Christmas tree was said to create an atmosphere of \u201cpagan demon magic\u201d that would subsume the Star of Bethlehem and the birth of Jesus in feelings of \u201cGermanness.\u201d\n\nFamily singing epitomized the porous boundaries between private and official forms of celebration.\n\nSheet music for the popular carol Exalted Night of the Clear Stars. Author provided\n\n\n\n\n\nPropagandists tirelessly promoted numerous Nazified Christmas songs, which replaced Christian themes with the regime\u2019s racial ideologies. Exalted Night of the Clear Stars, the most famous Nazi carol, was reprinted in Nazi songbooks, broadcast in radio programs, performed at countless public celebrations\u2014and sung at home.\n\nIndeed, Exalted Night became so familiar that it could still be sung in the 1950s as part of an ordinary family holiday (and, apparently, as part of some public performances today!).\n\nWhile the song\u2019s melody mimics a traditional carol, the lyrics deny the Christian origins of the holiday. Verses of stars, light and an eternal mother suggest a world redeemed through faith in National Socialism\u2014not Jesus.\n\nConflict or consensus among the German public?\n\nWe\u2019ll never know exactly how many German families sang Exalted Night or baked Christmas cookies shaped like a Germanic sun wheel. But we do have some records of the popular response to the Nazi holiday, mostly from official sources.\n\nFor example, the \u201cactivity reports\u201d of the National Socialist Women\u2019s League (NSF) show that the redefinition of Christmas created some disagreement among members. NSF files note that tensions flared when propagandists pressed too hard to sideline religious observance, leading to \u201cmuch doubt and discontent.\u201d\n\nReligious traditions often clashed with ideological goals: was it acceptable for \u201cconvinced National Socialists\u201d to celebrate Christmas with Christian carols and nativity plays? How could Nazi believers observe a Nazi holiday when stores mostly sold conventional holiday goods and rarely stocked Nazi Christmas books?\n\nMeanwhile, German clergymen openly resisted Nazi attempts to take Christ out of Christmas. In D\u00fcsseldorf, clergymen used Christmas to encourage women to join their respective women\u2019s clubs. Catholic clergy threatened to excommunicate women who joined the NSF. Elsewhere, women of faith boycotted NSF Christmas parties and charity drives.\n\nStill, such dissent never really challenged the main tenets of the Nazi holiday.\n\nReports on public opinion compiled by the Nazi secret police often commented on the popularity of Nazi Christmas festivities. Well into the Second World War, when looming defeat increasingly discredited the Nazi holiday, the secret police reported that complaints about official policies dissolved in an overall \u201cChristmas mood.\u201d\n\nDespite conflicts over Christianity, many Germans accepted the Nazification of Christmas. The return to colorful and enjoyable pagan \u201cGermanic\u201d traditions promised to revitalize family celebration. Not least, observing a Nazified holiday symbolized racial purity and national belonging. \u201cAryans\u201d could celebrate German Christmas. Jews could not.\n\nThe Nazification of family celebration thus revealed the paradoxical and contested terrain of private life in the Third Reich. The apparently banal, everyday decision to sing a particular Christmas carol, or bake a holiday cookie, became either an act of political dissent or an expression of support for national socialism.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

    "text": "Gifts also serve as investments in relationships. When interpreted this way, the destruction of value can be part of the very essence of gift-giving. If I give you a $50 gift card for Best Buy and you give me a $50 e-certificate for Amazon, economists would tolerate the exchange, since no destruction of wealth has occurred. However, very little investment has occurred, either. Suppose instead that I give you an expensive sweater that you find loathsome, and you give me a fancy travel case for which I have no use. True, each of us might think that the other has terrible taste. But we will certainly notice the effort and money that went into the purchase. In fact, destroying value in an exchange of overpriced gifts can increase the likelihood that our relationship will endure. If we weren\u2019t committed to the relationship, why would we waste the money?\n\nThe absurd tension associated with gift-giving begins early in life. One of our colleagues notes that, during her two-year-old\u2019s birthday party, her son became progressively numbed by the obscene onslaught of gifts. But each of the guests emerged momentarily from his cake-induced stupor and became raptly attentive when the gift he had brought was opened. You are probably not so different from those two-year-olds. Try to recall what each of your family members gave you last holiday season and what you gave them. If you are like the majority of the students and colleagues in our informal poll, you\u2019ll be better able to recall the gifts you gave than those you received.\n\nGift-giving is fraught in part because the messages that people want to send can be subtle, and gifts are an extremely crude means of communication. For instance, an obvious way to send the message \u201cyou are very important to me\u201d is to purchase an expensive gift. But what if the recipient doesn\u2019t realize the gift was expensive? You could remark offhandedly that \u201cit\u2019s a genuine Vuitton!\u201d\u2014intending this to translate as \u201cand that\u2019s how much I care about you.\u201d But the recipient is just as likely to hear \u201cand I want you to know that I spent a lot, so you will properly appreciate what a terrific guy I am.\u201d She may even interpret your comment as an expectation of reciprocity, which spoils the effect altogether.\n\nBehavioral research on perspective-taking provides some explanations for why gift-buying is often such a waste of money. When people try to predict how another person will respond to a certain situation, they begin by imagining how they themselves would respond, and then they make adjustments for differences between themselves and the other person. At both stages, they make big mistakes.\n\nSurprisingly, people often mis-predict their own desires. Anyone with unworn clothing in the closet or unread books on the shelf will recognize this problem. One reason we mis-give to ourselves is that we are creatures of the present. Research on catalog orders finds that, on frigid days, people buy warm clothing. However, it takes a few days for the clothing to arrive, and by that time the weather may have changed. This is why the return rate is unusually high for cold-weather products bought in chilly temperatures."

    "title": "Is It Ethical to Post Pictures of Your Kids on Instagram?",
    "authors": [
      "Josephine Livingstone"
    ],
    "text": "The IG mommy-blogger poses two chief questions for the regular Instagram user. First, is there a political argument for letting the mommy-bloggers be, even following them? Second, what is the regular, non-famous parent supposed to do about the new economy of Instagram parenting?\n\n\n\nOne could argue that these women are simply entrepreneurs. If a stay-at-home-mom becomes an Instagram-famous mommy-blogger, and therefore derives an income that recompenses her otherwise unpaid domestic labor, her claim on that cash may well trump the rights of her child. Women traditionally perform undervalued work that is nevertheless crucial to the functioning of society. Maybe the mommy-blogger has simply found wages for the second shift.\n\nMaybe the mommy-blogger has simply found wages for the second shift.\n\nThen again, these women (there are a few men, but only a few) are overwhelmingly white, able-bodied, and beautiful, and so are their children. Blame the entertainment and advertising industries, if you want. But it\u2019s our clicks that become the numbers that companies use to calculate who gets what sponcon deal. Every time Instagram serves up some blonde Midwestern domestic goddess on the Explore page and you reward them with a tap of your finger, you are participating in an attention economy that is, through the dark art of the algorithm, continually reinforcing racist and classist ideals of what it is to be lovely, successful, and female.\n\nIt\u2019s a system that implicates everyone. Let\u2019s say that you\u2019re a parent. You\u2019re not famous, and you post about your kids in the form of a public diary, updating your friends and family with the events of their day. There\u2019s nothing distasteful there. Unless, well\u2014is your account public? Do you find yourself choosing pictures of your child that make you look like a good parent?\n\nEverybody curates their public image online. But it is worth considering whether the parental instinct to seek company\u2014to be made less alone in the long journey of parenthood\u2014is compromised by the cues and rewards built into the platform itself. Things get uncanny, for example, when normal people post portraits of infants that are elaborately staged and obviously taken with expensive cameras. Even if the parent is not sponsored by a corporation, she or he might as well be, aesthetically speaking, in their effort to represent the child (and their life in general) in portfolio form. The Instagram grid becomes a kind of resum\u00e9.\n\nAnd what if your child does ultimately become Instagram-famous? Once this happens, and your child gets recognized in the street, say, then you have lost control. In a recent article on Babble, for example, the writer asks whether it is \u201cweird\u201d for an adult to follow a child on Instagram. She is reassured by Lizzie Post, great-great-granddaughter of the etiquette queen Emily Post, who says no: \u201cIt\u2019s not weird at all to follow a kid on Instagram.\u201d She adds, \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re spying on a child through their bedroom window.\u201d\n\nBut it is a little weird for adults to follow children. There are so, so many children with their own Instagram accounts, and they exist because adults have shaped that \u201ccareer path.\u201d There are child makeup artists who seem like professionals prepping themselves for the inevitable Ellen appearance. There are children on Instagram who are famous for simply being beautiful. (Behold: @beautifulmixedkids.) It may not be akin to spying on a child through their bedroom window, but adults are the ones who are making real money off this stuff\u2014the executives at Instagram and Facebook, and the parents who control the endorsements that kiddie content reels in.\n\nIf you\u2019re a normal parent, most of this has nothing to do with you or your intentions. (The media will always tell you that you\u2019re doing everything wrong, and I\u2019ve no wish to malign the innocent.) But, just as Post is missing some important data points in her analysis, I think the rest of us might be too. Just think about what you were like at age 7, 10, or 12. Unless you\u2019re a very young parent, you probably did not grow up with photographs of your childhood splattered online for anybody to find. Beyond the old trope of the Hollywood child star\u2014not encouraging\u2014how can we possibly know what that kind of exposure does to a kid?\n\nWhen I discussed this article\u2019s ideas with a colleague of mine, she predicted \u201ca wave of memoirs, circa 2030, by people who were psychologically damaged as children because they got posted about too much.\u201d That could be your child. You could be condemning them to a career of misery-memoir with every photo you post. They might not grow up Kardashian-famous, but if you Instagram your child in public and at regular intervals, then you might be doing something that you cannot undo. So take a moment at the turn of the New Year to sit with the new facts of social media and how they could affect your kids\u2019 future happiness. Unless you\u2019re French, in which case just watch out for the cops."

She\u2019s there, standing off-center, watching as Sof\u00eda (Marina de Tavira), Cleo\u2019s employer, squeezes her husband in an awkward embrace before he climbs into his car to drive to the airport for a work trip in Quebec. She\u2019s there, again, when Sof\u00eda, distraught after a phone call with her mother, catches Paco, one of her teenage sons, eavesdropping on her conversation and smacks him in retaliation. He falls to the floor, crying, and she does, too, to console him. \u201cWhy are you still there?\u201d she glares at Cleo. \u201cDon\u2019t you have anything to do?\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s there, too, in the evening to open the garage gates for Sof\u00eda, who, in her husband\u2019s prolonged absence, returns from a drunken night out in her husband\u2019s gigantic Ford Galaxy. She veers into the driveway, slamming and scraping the car against the concrete walls before slipping out. \u201cNo matter what they tell you,\u201d Sof\u00eda slurs, clutching Cleo\u2019s face by the doorway, \u201cwe women are always alone.\u201d Her words linger, as Cleo, frozen and expressionless, stares back. There is a fleeting recognition of the two women\u2019s shared pain, but it\u2019s immediately overshadowed by their lopsided relationship. Sof\u00eda walks into the house, up the staircase and to her room, as Cleo stands outside, out of focus, looking in.\n\nThe concepts for Roma can be found in Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s work from over a decade and a half ago, in his seminal 2001 film Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n\u2014a raunchy, semi-autobiographical story about two adolescents, played by Diego Luna and Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, who convince a married Spanish woman fed up with her husband\u2019s infidelities to road-trip with them across Mexico. Within months of its release, the film had become a cult classic for audiences abroad. Critics praised Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s visceral and layered storytelling, social analysis, and political commentary. \u201cIt is as if the American Pie DVD had a director\u2019s commentary by Susan Sontag or JK Galbraith,\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw wrote in 2002. Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n and similar movies from the time\u2014such as Alejandro I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s brilliant Amores Perros (2000)\u2014paved the way for an ambitious, probing movie like Roma, which is now considered a contender for Best Picture at the upcoming Academy Awards.\n\nBut there\u2019s also a direct link between the story told in Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n and Roma. As the trio in the earlier movie drives south along the semi-arid ridges of Oaxaca, skirting small towns, the movie\u2019s brash, teenage protagonist Tenoch (Diego Luna) notices a sign. It marks Tepelmeme, the birthplace of his nanny, Leo, who had moved to Mexico City when she was 13. \u201cTenoch realized he had never visited Tepelmeme,\u201d the narrator explains. The scene reflects Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s realization, as he recently told Variety, that he knew relatively little about Rodriguez\u2019s life in Tepelmeme or about her existence outside the confines of his home.\n\nHe didn\u2019t take up this theme in Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n, though the film does offer glimpses of the troubled country that exists just beyond its focus. The movie\u2019s narrator alludes to the Zapatista rebellion in Chiapas (When the two teenage protagonists approach Tenoch\u2019s sister, who is marching at a student protest, to borrow the family car, she agrees on the condition that she get it the following three weeks to deliver food, clothes and medicine to Chiapas) and the pernicious effects of Mexico\u2019s modernizing tourism industry (\u201cBy the end of the year, Chuy\u201d\u2014a fisherman the travelers meet at the beach\u2014\u201cand his family will have to leave their home to make way for the construction of an exclusive hotel,\u201d the narrator says.). In several scenes, Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s camera wanders to paint vignettes of nannies and waitresses shuffling in and out of kitchens to serve meals, whether they are in an upscale home, or at a modest off-road restaurant in rural Mexico."

At that point, Trump was unhappy with the compromise Republican leaders had agreed to but was willing to go along with it, despite criticism from the right-wing media. \u201cMeadows, who is close with the president and was recently in the running to be his next chief of staff, urged Trump to make a stand now before Democrats took the House in January \u2014 just as he had the night before and multiple times earlier in the week,\u201d Politico reports. \u201cStick to your guns, the North Carolina Republican told the president, according to a source familiar with the conversation.

    "text": "When we say that a movie or a book \u201cromanticizes\u201d a harmful activity, we usually mean that it irresponsibly makes drug use or violence seem like something that the viewer might also like to do. Trainspotting or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, for example, show booze and drugs as interesting and cool (Leaving Las Vegas, less so). But romanticization also has another meaning. The word comes from the Old French, and before it became about love or sublimity, a romance was a story in verse (roman still means novel in French).\n\nStorytelling and romanticism are closely linked\u2014sisters in narrative, if you will. Art that is about suffering is always at risk of romanticizing that suffering, because the act of telling a story imposes beginnings and middles and ends, not to mention stirring soundtracks, upon experiences that in real life have no such punctuation. To make a movie about drugs almost guarantees that you romanticize them, because otherwise there would be no narrative at all\u2014just long nights, empty bank accounts, and a feeling like cold hunger.\n\nTwo new movies about white teenagers addicted to drugs, as well as the parents who struggle to keep them upright, labor to overcome this inherent tension. Ben Is Back stars Julia Roberts as mom Holly, whose son Ben returns home for Christmas on an ill-advised visit from rehab for his opioid addiction. The movie follows one wild Christmas Eve, as the consequences of Ben\u2019s previous actions come back to haunt him. Holly has to chase him across town as he makes a series of very bad decisions.\n\nBeautiful Boy is also about a son and a parent. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is Nic, and Steve Carell is his father David. Where Ben Is Back is set in cold New York state, Beautiful Boy is a story of sunny, Californian addiction. One features a mom, the other a dad. But the movies follow the same basic arc: white son wrenches away from a loving family and into serious addiction. What can a parent do in the face of this affliction? And where do they draw the painful lines in the sand when the children go too far? The sons just keep screwing up, and nobody knows what to do."

    "text": "The Associated Press is reporting that President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria crystallized during a December 14 phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. According to the news agency, the decision was \u201cmade hastily, without consulting his national security team or allies, and over strong objections from virtually everyone involved in the fight against the Islamic State group, according to U.S. and Turkish officials.\u201d\n\nOne of the surprising details of the report is that Erdogan himself was taken aback at how successful he was in convincing Trump on the Syrian matter. Before the phone call, the consensus position that the Trump administration had reached, backed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, was that Trump would tell Erdogan to back off from his threats to attack Kurdish forces in Syria.\n\nBut during the phone conversation, Trump threw away the script and agreed with his Turkish counterpart. As AP relates, Trump started by reiterating the message of backing off. But then a change occurred:\n\nErdogan, though, quickly put Trump on the defensive, reminding him that he had repeatedly said the only reason for U.S. troops to be in Syria was to defeat the Islamic State and that the group had been 99 percent defeated. \u201cWhy are you still there?\u201d the second official said Erdogan asked Trump, telling him that the Turks could deal with the remaining IS militants.\n\nTrump then posed Erdogan\u2019s question to his National Security Advisor John Bolton, who was participating in the phone call. Bolton admitted that the Islamic State had indeed lost 99 per cent of its territory but said that it was in America\u2019s interest to make sure the group did not enjoy a resurgence.\n\nTrump was not dissuaded, according to the officials, who said the president quickly capitulated by pledging to withdraw, shocking both Bolton and Erdogan. Caught off guard, Erdogan cautioned Trump against a hasty withdrawal, according to one official. While Turkey has made incursions into Syria in the past, it does not have the necessary forces mobilized on the border to move in and hold the large swaths of northeastern Syria where U.S. troops are positioned, the official said.\n\nFrom this reporting, it seems likely that it was never Erdogan\u2019s intention to get the United States to withdraw. Rather he made the demand as a bargaining move, to get other, lesser goals. Trump, displaying his mastery of the art of the deal, gave in to Erdogan\u2019s maximum position.\n\nThe White House denies the accuracy of AP\u2019s account."

    "text": "When Mary Poppins (Emily Blunt) arrives, she glides through the Banks\u2019s door with characteristic primness and ease, reminding an astonished Michael that \u201cwe are still not a codfish.\u201d Blunt\u2019s interpretation of the character draws elegantly on Julie Andrews\u2019s presentation of pleasant self-assurance while introducing a dash of beguiling humor. Blunt\u2019s Poppins nods jovially at the family\u2019s disbelief, while anticipating the pleasure of enveloping them in a second whirlwind of magic. She conjures wonder in order to nourish her charges with both joy and confidence in their burgeoning imaginations. And while Mary Poppins Returns thankfully draws less gawking attention to the titular character\u2019s physical charms, Mary is, of course, immaculately coiffed, with an enviably snappy collection of coats and kitten heels, and she is just a bit vain. When Jane and Michael exclaim that it is marvelous to see her again, she agrees while primping in the entryway mirror.\n\nIn superficial terms, Mary resumes her post to do what she did years before: to care for the Banks children. But just as before, her aims are finespun and rather more challenging. She must demonstrate to the Banks children the nurturing potential of pleasure and fancy\u2014\u201csome stuff and nonsense could be fun,\u201d she sings\u2014while gently encouraging them to mourn their mother. I happened to attend a press screening on the day preceding the one year anniversary of my own mother\u2019s death; perhaps unsurprisingly, I melted into tears as Blunt delivered a compassionate and graceful performance of \u201cThe Place Where the Lost Things Go,\u201d wherein she reassures Anabel, John, and Georgie that death never means annihilation, but rather a cosmic rearrangement. The song supplies an answer to Michael\u2019s earlier lament, \u201cA Conversation,\u201d in which he considers how his late wife always knew what to do, and how in her absence he is bereft. \u201cWhere\u2019d you go?\u201d he wonders, slouched in the attic, encompassed by dust-soft relics from his childhood and marriage.\n\nAlthough Mary Poppins Returns is an ardent, nearly shot-for-shot love letter to the first film, its more somber thematic premise pairs with its efforts to craft characters and a narrative that are more culturally evolved. In order to incorporate Jack into the larger Poppins narrative, the film introduces him as a former chimney sweep who, as a child, was under Bert\u2019s tutelage and who, conveniently, did not die of black lung before adolescence. He and Mary revel in one another\u2019s company with platonic warmth; there are no traces of the sexual disappointment Bert (Dick Van Dyke) betrays during \u201cJolly Holiday\u201d when Mary thanks him for \u201cnever pressing [his] advantage\u201d and summarily indicates that they will never be an item. In fact, we learn that Jack has adored Jane Banks since youth, formerly gazing up at her nursery window, an image making manifest the socioeconomic berth that once precluded their companionship.\n\nBen Whishaw\u2019s paternal masculinity is at once cottony and slightly tremulous: an empathetic portrayal of someone determined to be the sort of father that his own probably wasn\u2019t.\n\nAs an adult, neither Jane nor her family harbor any sense of class superiority, and she and Jack timidly\u2014and very adorably\u2014enter into a fledgling romance. Admiral Boom (David Warner) still presides over Cherry Tree Lane with militant neurosis, and he still possesses a baffling cache of gunpowder and weaponry, but he is mercifully no longer sputtering racial epithets. Michael, despite some spare, intermittent endeavors to project a stiff upper lip, allows his children to bear witness to his sorrow and, in pointed contrast with his father, never leaves them in question of his love. Ben Whishaw\u2019s paternal masculinity is at once cottony and slightly tremulous: an empathetic portrayal of someone determined to be the sort of father that his own probably wasn\u2019t.\n\nYet, until his wife\u2019s death, he was, in all likelihood, a relatively passive parent\u2014not as a result of patriarchal disconnect or apathy, but because he is, over the course of the film, still cultivating the assertiveness Kate seems to have possessed, and that he needs in order to advocate for his family. When the score drifts into his father\u2019s theme, \u201cThe Life I Lead,\u201d it settles against Michael\u2019s troubled countenance like a sonic subconscious, as he muddles over what sort of father to be; that is to say, what sort of father will deliver his family from their financial catastrophe and regain the pacific household atmosphere fostered by his wife. Unlike so many men of his era, he must accustom himself to domesticity."

    "text": "But the burden President Donald Trump is foisting onto Mexico today is unprecedented. In November, The Washington Post reported that Mexico\u2019s newly elected president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, had struck a deal with the Trump administration to make the Mexican side of the border a permanent way station for asylum seekers bound for the United States. Once the story was published, L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s administration denied it. But even so, thousands of migrants remain on the Mexican side, waiting to hear who will decide their fate. Never before has Mexico had to house so many people indefinitely. Trump, said Arturo Sarukhan, a former Mexican ambassador to the United States, is continuing to use Mexico \u201cas an electoral and political pi\u00f1ata.\u201d The country has become \u201ca de facto filter to the U.S.\u201d without getting anything in return.\n\n\n\nIn 2015, more than a million migrants made their way to Europe, and the backlash to their sudden arrival destabilized the politics of the entire continent. Though migrants have been arriving in Mexico for a long time, their presence has created many of the same problems. The government in Tijuana hasn\u2019t embraced the encampment, nor have many residents. In November, hundreds of Mexicans marched to pro\u00adtest the camp\u2019s existence, some of them shouting \u201cTijuana first!\u201d and \u201cno more migrants!\u201d while the mayor, who has called on the caravan leaders to be prosecuted for bringing the migrants into the country, appeared wearing a red \u201cMake Tijuana great again\u201d baseball hat.\n\nConditions inside the shelters and encampments are dire. When I visited the main camp, an open-air soccer stadium packed with tents and makeshift shelters, it was raining. By midday, after hours of heavy downpour, the stadium floor had turned to mud. People packed into the Enclave Caracol, where a volunteer organization called Food Not Bombs dished up warm meals. (A few months earlier, they\u2019d been serving 150 meals a day in Tijuana, mostly to Mexicans who\u2019d been deported from the United States; now it\u2019s 500, almost entirely for migrants who are heading into the United States.) Despite the weather, the months spent on the road, and the prospect of deportation, the mood was cheery: A DJ was playing pop music on the speakers; small children ran around the feet of adults who chatted over steaming heaps of pasta and cups of coffee.\n\nThe government has struggled to feed, house, and clothe the refugees. Every day, thousands of people need to eat; they need medical care, jackets, and blankets; children need diapers, and women sanitary pads. Given the limited resources and organizational capacity of Mexican authorities, groups like Food Not Bombs have stepped in, as have legal service providers and other humanitarian organizations. I spoke to a woman named Elodia, who had fled Guatemala with her two children, leaving behind an abusive husband who had burned down her family\u2019s house after she\u2019d tried to leave him. A volunteer had just handed her a packet of four diapers. At least it would get her through the next couple of days, she said. What she really needed, though, was a chance to plead her case for safety in the United States.\n\nThe human consequences of trapping migrants along the border are self-evident. The political ones may also be severe\u2014for Mexico and for the United States. When Germany forced countries on Europe\u2019s periphery to bear the responsibility for housing the majority of migrants, it did little to quell\u2014and may even have exacerbated\u2014xenophobic uprisings in that nation and throughout the European Union."

General Mattis was a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations. A new Secretary of Defense will be named shortly. I greatly thank Jim for his service! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 20, 2018\n\nThere are speculations that Mattis\u2019s resignation wasn\u2019t voluntary and that he was fired:\n\n@barbarastarrcnn, Pentagon correspondent for CNN, Jim Mattis is not retiring, he is being \"pushed out.\" \u2014 Namo Abdulla (@namo_abdulla) December 20, 2018\n\nMattis\u2019s resignation letter is notable for scanting any praise of the president (as is customary in the genre) and highlighting policy differences.\n\nPart of the letter reads:\n\nOne core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies. Like you, I have said from the beginning that the armed forces of the United States should not be the policeman of the world. Instead, we must use all tools of American power to provide for the common defense, including providing effective leadership to our alliances. 29 democracies demonstrated that strength in their commitment to fighting alongside us following the 9-11 attack on America. The Defeat-ISIS coalition of 74 nations is further proof. Similarly, I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours. It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model gaining veto authority over other nations economic, diplomatic, and security decisions to promote their own interests at the expense of their neighbors, America and our allies. That is why we must use all the tools of American power to provide for the common defense. My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances. Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position\n\nIt\u2019s hard to read this passage as anything other than a repudiation of Trump\u2019s foreign policy."

The same day, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that American\u2019s announced attention to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty raises the likelihood of nuclear war.\n\nThe North Korean statement is an outgrowth of the Trump administration\u2019s overselling of the agreement reached between the United States, North Korea, and South Korea in the Singapore summit in June. At that summit, the parties agreed to \u201ccomplete denuclearization\u201d of the Korean Peninsula, a vague statement that made no commitment as to time frame or sequencing.\n\n\u201cThe United States must now recognize the accurate meaning of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and especially, must study geography,\u201d the North Korean statement asserts. \u201cWhen we talk about the Korean Peninsula, it includes the territory of our republic and also the entire region of (South Korea) where the United States has placed its invasive force, including nuclear weapons. When we talk about the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it means the removal of all sources of nuclear threat, not only from the South and North but also from areas neighboring the Korean Peninsula.\u201d\n\nThe statement added, \u201cBy replacing the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula with \u2018the denuclearization of north Korea,\u2019 the U.S. tries to cause the optical illusion of the people in their view of the DPRK-U.S. relations.\u201d\n\nAnd here's the full English-language text of N.

The Daily Beast reported on Thursday morning that the special counsel\u2019s inquiry is entering a new phase focused on influence from Middle Eastern countries. Later that evening, The Washington Post reported that final sentencing for some of Mueller\u2019s cooperating witnesses could indicate his investigation is nearing the end.

At the same time, federal investigators have yet to formally allege hard collusion\u2014an explicit quid pro quo between the two sides.\n\nThis tension is a staple of the Russia investigation coverage. According to press reports in recent months, Mueller\u2019s inquiry has been at once expanding and narrowing, gaining steam and losing momentum, intensifying and \u201cwrapping up.\u201d Mueller himself has kept virtually silent about where his investigation is headed next or what form its conclusion will take, making him the most mysterious man in Washington. Unless he\u2019s prematurely ousted by the president, the American people won\u2019t find out what the special counsel is truly up to until it\u2019s all over.\n\nThis mystery may be by design, or merely the result of Mueller\u2019s sharpest tactical decisions: spinning off parts of his investigation to multiple U.S. attorneys\u2019 offices up and down the Eastern Seaboard. Indeed, it\u2019s no longer accurate to sum up the president\u2019s legal troubles under the banner of \u201cthe Russia investigation.\u201d The bulk of the federal investigatory firepower aimed at his inner circle is now coming from outside Mueller\u2019s control, widening the risk to the president himself."

    "text": "There are very few moments in life when a whole mesh of illusions is stripped from you at once. I remember this one very clearly. I realized all of a sudden that the word \u201cPalestinian\u201d had been wrapped very deliberately in layers of hatred all my life. I remembered the racial slurs I\u2019d heard uttered about Arabs in high school, all before I met a single one. I realized I had been taught to view all Palestinians as violent\u2014that it was a shock to find them human, to sit beside them on a couch, to watch TV, break bread and play with their child. I had been taught to see all Palestinians as willing to murder me, to murder a baby, with no provocation, an inferior race of fire-eyed zealots. I had been taught that what was theirs was mine by right. I had not been taught about the violence of the occupation, and that omission was as deliberate as anything else. I had been taught a sequence of beautiful myths, the swelling myths of nationalism, but they were lies\u2014lies of omission, pretty stories with venom at the heart.\n\nIt felt like being stabbed, to know the people who taught me had deceived me so thoroughly, and had kept me ignorant, on purpose, of so much history.\n\nI wish I could say that since then I have evolved significantly, or joined some of my Jewish brethren on the knife\u2019s edge of pro-Palestinian activism. I wish I could tell you I am no longer complacent, that I\u2019ve left all nationalist sentiment behind.\n\nBut it\u2019s not that simple. For one thing, my twin sister, who joined me in that dusty seminary, moved to Israel six years ago. She lives there with her baby and husband and in-laws; my other sister\u2019s husband is Israeli, too, and his parents live just around the corner from my twin. I still remember the taste of pomegranates, schawarma, lafa from the souk on Ben Yehuda Street. I still speak Hebrew, even if I don\u2019t pray in it any longer. In America, to be a Jew is always to be an \u201cother\u201d; in Israel, it\u2019s thrillingly unremarkable. I\u2019m still steeped in the culture that taught me Palestinian history wasn\u2019t worth learning; I love my family, and the rosy stones of Jerusalem, and I remember the clear pool on the kibbutz where the figs hung low on the water.\n\nAll I can tell you is that I live uneasily now where Israel is concerned. That I watch Bibi Netanyahu speak in his smooth baritone and I hear the same hate I was raised with; it doesn\u2019t surprise me that he has found kinship with Orban, and with Trump, whose supremacy is based on historical elision and present brutality. I feel compelled to speak out when Israeli strikes murder Gazan civilians. I try to see clearly when just criticism of Israel and Zionism veers into something murkier and more sinister, the ugly rhetoric of anti-Semitism. I wince when the white supremacists I study for a living bring up the Israeli \u201cethnostate\u201d as proof that their own desires are healthy. And in the face of the new nation-state law in Israel\u2014which limits the \u201cright to national-self determination\u201d in Israel to \u201cthe Jewish people,\u201d encourages \u201cJewish settlement,\u201d and demotes the status of Arabic from an official language\u2014I struggle to refute this argument completely.\n\nLife in this seam of unease isn\u2019t simple; I avoid discussion of \u201cthe conflict\u201d with my family too often, and with my leftist friends I omit discussions of my Zionist past and my present ambiguities as often as possible. But I have found it is better to live in the pain of not-knowing than to live in a certainty held together by zealous self-righteousness. It is better to live gasping, in my own fretful inadequacy, than sealed off forever in an airless myth."

Trump, said Arturo Sarukhan, a former Mexican ambassador to the United States, is continuing to use Mexico \u201cas an electoral and political pi\u00f1ata.\u201d The country has become \u201ca de facto filter to the U.S.\u201d without getting anything in return.\n\n\n\nIn 2015, more than a million migrants made their way to Europe, and the backlash to their sudden arrival destabilized the politics of the entire continent. Though migrants have been arriving in Mexico for a long time, their presence has created many of the same problems. The government in Tijuana hasn\u2019t embraced the encampment, nor have many residents. In November, hundreds of Mexicans marched to pro\u00adtest the camp\u2019s existence, some of them shouting \u201cTijuana first!\u201d and \u201cno more migrants!\u201d while the mayor, who has called on the caravan leaders to be prosecuted for bringing the migrants into the country, appeared wearing a red \u201cMake Tijuana great again\u201d baseball hat.\n\nConditions inside the shelters and encampments are dire. When I visited the main camp, an open-air soccer stadium packed with tents and makeshift shelters, it was raining. By midday, after hours of heavy downpour, the stadium floor had turned to mud. People packed into the Enclave Caracol, where a volunteer organization called Food Not Bombs dished up warm meals. (A few months earlier, they\u2019d been serving 150 meals a day in Tijuana, mostly to Mexicans who\u2019d been deported from the United States; now it\u2019s 500, almost entirely for migrants who are heading into the United States.) Despite the weather, the months spent on the road, and the prospect of deportation, the mood was cheery: A DJ was playing pop music on the speakers; small children ran around the feet of adults who chatted over steaming heaps of pasta and cups of coffee.\n\nThe government has struggled to feed, house, and clothe the refugees. Every day, thousands of people need to eat; they need medical care, jackets, and blankets; children need diapers, and women sanitary pads. Given the limited resources and organizational capacity of Mexican authorities, groups like Food Not Bombs have stepped in, as have legal service providers and other humanitarian organizations. I spoke to a woman named Elodia, who had fled Guatemala with her two children, leaving behind an abusive husband who had burned down her family\u2019s house after she\u2019d tried to leave him. A volunteer had just handed her a packet of four diapers. At least it would get her through the next couple of days, she said. What she really needed, though, was a chance to plead her case for safety in the United States.\n\nThe human consequences of trapping migrants along the border are self-evident. The political ones may also be severe\u2014for Mexico and for the United States. When Germany forced countries on Europe\u2019s periphery to bear the responsibility for housing the majority of migrants, it did little to quell\u2014and may even have exacerbated\u2014xenophobic uprisings in that nation and throughout the European Union."

    "text": "Two significant developments show that President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is worried about a primary challenge before the 2020 election. First, Politico is reporting that the Trump campaign is fusing with the Republican National Committee. Secondly, The Washington Examiner notes that the South Carolina GOP might do away with its primary altogether.\n\nAccording to Politico, \u201cthe Trump reelection campaign and the RNC will merge their field and fundraising programs into a joint outfit dubbed Trump Victory. The two teams will also share office space rather than operate out of separate buildings, as has been custom.\u201d The news outlet adds that, \u201cWith talk of a primary challenge to Trump simmering, the act of formally tying the president\u2019s reelection campaign to the resource-rich national party will make it only harder for would-be Republican opponents to mount a bid.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, as The Washington Examiner notes, the South Carolina GOP \u201ccould cancel its marquee presidential nominating contest in 2020 in a move to protect President Trump from any primary challengers.\u201d The website cites the precedent of Iowa not issuing ballots in 1992 with the goal of protecting then-incumbent President George H. W. Bush and South Carolina cancelling its primary in 2004 to shield George W. Bush.\n\nThe intriguing question from this news is why the Trump campaign is working so hard to guard against a primary challenge. After all, as the Examiner rightly notes, \u201cThe president is solid with Republican voters and would almost certainly defeat any intraparty opposition.\u201d\n\nAs CNN reported on Tuesday,\n\nPresident Donald Trump continues to look in prime position to win his party\u2019s nomination for president in 2020. While Republicans such as John Kasich may run, a look at the numbers reveals they have a tough road ahead of them. CNN\u2019s latest Iowa poll shows little room for a successful primary challenge in the first in nation caucus. Trump scored an 81% approval rating among registered Republicans. The vast majority, 67%, of Republicans also said that they would definitely vote to re-elect Trump.\n\nHowever commanding a lead he has in polls of Republican voters, Trump isn\u2019t taking any chances and is gearing up to create a fortress to keep out any challengers. Ironically, it\u2019s possible that the president and his team have bought into the Never Trump fantasy scenarios of a party revolt."

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 19, 2018\n\nTrump\u2019s tweets don\u2019t always reflect actual policy, and in fact the government is sending mixed messages on Syria. As The New York Times reports, Trump has ordered a complete immediate withdrawal, but he\u2019s done so in the face of resistance from the Pentagon and his own secretary of defense, James Mattis.\n\nTrump\u2019s military advisers have warned that a rapid withdrawal would embolden rivals such as Russia and Iran. America\u2019s Kurdish allies in Syria have also been threatened in recent days by the Turkish government, which has warned it would attack them. A rapid withdrawal would endanger not only Syrian Kurds but also weaken America\u2019s credibility with other local fighters in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Syria.\n\n\n\nAs The Daily Beast notes, the government is sending mixed messages on Syria, with the Pentagon seemingly suggesting that there has been no policy shift. In a statement, Pentagon spokesperson Rob Manning said, \u201cAt this time, we continue to work by, with and through our partners in the region.\u201d\n\nPentagon spokesperson Dana White also seemed to contradict the idea that the war with ISIS has been won.\n\nAnd now from Pentagon's Dana White:\n\n\n\n\"The Coalition has liberated the ISIS-held territory, but the campaign against ISIS is not over.\n\n\n\n\"We have started the process of returning U.S. troops home from Syria as we transition to the next phase of the campaign.\" \u2014 Spencer Ackerman (@attackerman) December 19, 2018\n\nKey Republicans are also speaking out against the move. \u201cThis is chaos,\u201d South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters. He also tweeted:\n\nWith all due respect, ISIS is not defeated in Syria, Iraq, and after just returning from visiting there -- certainly not Afghanistan. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) December 19, 2018\n\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio also spoke out against the move:\n\nMarco Rubio railed on the president\u2019s decision to pull out of Syria, saying whoever advised him has done a \u201cgreat disservice\u201d to the country. He said to us that Trump has put the US at risk by his decision - and it will make the world view America as an unreliable partner. \u2014 Manu Raju (@mkraju) December 19, 2018\n\nWithdrawing from Syria is not, on the face of it, an inherently bad or indefensible policy. But what is undeniably dangerous is the chaotic manner the policy is being executed and the mixed messages being sent to the world. The incoherence increases the chance of greater conflict, as America\u2019s friends and rivals will see the country as a fickle and untrustworthy actor on the world stage."

The newspaper reports that Facebook shared private information about its users with so-called \u201cpartners\u201d (companies with business agreements with Facebook). Because of these partnerships, Facebook felt it didn\u2019t need to notify either its users or government regulators at the Federal Trade Commission (F.T.C.).\n\n\u201cThe social network allowed Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine to see the names of virtually all Facebook users\u2019 friends without consent, the records show, and gave Netflix and Spotify the ability to read Facebook users\u2019 private messages,\u201d the Times notes. \u201cFacebook also allowed Spotify, Netflix and the Royal Bank of Canada to read, write and delete users\u2019 private messages, and to see all participants on a thread \u2014 privileges that appeared to go beyond what the companies needed to integrate Facebook into their systems, the records show.\u201d\n\nAside from Spotify, Bing, Netflix, and the Royal Bank of Canada, other \u201cpartners\u201d that Facebook shared information with include Yahoo, Amazon, the Russian search engine Yandex, and the Chinese firm Huawei. Both Yandex and Huawei are known to work with the security services of their home countries. Huawei has been named as a security threat by the American government.\n\nThe list of companies with which Facebook shared your private information includes China's Huawei and Russia's Yandex -- which is to say, companies regarded as partners of Chinese and Russian intelligence.https://t.co/PbFP9D4vTj \u2014 Binyamin Appelbaum (@BCAppelbaum) December 19, 2018\n\nThe partnerships Facebook has created are two-way streets, so it receives information from companies it does business with. One tool to facilitate this is the much criticized \u201cPeople You May Know\u201d feature.\n\nAccording to the Times, \u201cThe feature, introduced in 2008, continues even though some Facebook users have objected to it, unsettled by its knowledge of their real-world relationships. Gizmodo and other news outlets have reported cases of the tool\u2019s recommending friend connections between patients of the same psychiatrist, estranged family members, and a harasser and his victim.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe F.T.C. has limited examination authority and seems to have outsourced its oversight duties to PriceWaterhouseCoopers, a company hired by Facebook.\n\n\n\nFormer F.T.C. official David Vladeck expressed amazement at Facebook\u2019s business practices. \u201cThis is just giving third parties permission to harvest data without you being informed of it or giving consent to it,\u201d Vladeck told the Times.\n\n\n\nEarly Facebook investor Roger McNamee agreed. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it is legitimate to enter into data-sharing partnerships where there is not prior informed consent from the user,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cNo one should trust Facebook until they change their business model.\u201d"

First, on Monday, a member of parliament incensed by the delayed Brexit vote seized the chamber\u2019s seventeenth-century ceremonial mace, resulting in his ejection from the House of Commons. Then, Prime Minister Theresa May survived a mutiny of her own Conservative MPs, who concocted a plan for a no-confidence vote in wood-paneled quarters reportedly dubbed \u201cThe Kill Zone.\u201d Thursday, like Rasputin walking away from repeated assassination attempts, May limped to Brussels to try to convince European Union leaders to compromise on a Brexit deal that is almost certain to fail a domestic vote next month. Their response was a resounding \u201cno.\u201d\n\nMay has herself at least partly to blame. As Rasputin sold quackery to the Romanovs, so Britain\u2019s PM has peddled a fantasy, milquetoast Brexit that tries to reconcile the fringe \u201cno-dealers\u201d in her own party, for whom compromise with Brussels on issues like freedom of movement is treasonous, and with those who never wanted to leave in the first place, many of whom want a second referendum. May appeased almost nobody, the equivalent of asking a party of squabbling kids if they want ice cream or cake, then serving them sprouts. MPs must vote on the deal by January 21. Held today, the result of that vote would be withering.\n\nBritain has a long and illustrious theatrical tradition. But its body politic largely avoids the technicolor bombast U.S. politics are known for. Last week plans for a Brexit television debate between Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were shelved\u2014partly because arguments over the proposed rules and format swiftly sank negotiations, but also because of a general sense that the British public, deep in a state of bewildered ennui, would rather watch the reality show I\u2019m a Celebrity\u2026Get Me Out of Here!, in which Z-list stars perform humiliating stunts in the Australian jungle, like eating kangaroo anuses, than see May and Corbyn duke it out onstage.\n\nThis week, however, British politics has been veering ever closer to theatrics\u2014just not of the stage-managed sort that their American brethren have made a specialty of, and which might actually have been useful earlier in the Brexit saga to energize young voters, most of whom prefer to remain in the EU. Lloyd Russel-Moyle, the Labour MP who protested Brexit chicanery by attempting to carry the hulking, gold-and-precious-stone rod representing the Queen\u2019s ultimate dominion out of the hall, was foiled when John Bercow, the House\u2019s berobed speaker, told him calmly to \u201cput it back.\u201d"

The judge added, \u201cI cannot assure you, if you proceed today, you will not receive a sentence of incarceration.\u201d\n\nAs The Washington Post reports, \u201cFlynn, standing straight and flanked by attorneys on either side, looked shaken, his jaw clenched. Sullivan declared a recess to let Flynn consider whether he wanted to proceed and let the judge impose a punishment, or to delay and cooperate more with the special counsel in hopes of leniency.\u201d\n\nThe judge\u2019s anger was rooted in the fact that although Flynn had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, his lawyers had talked as if the onetime White House official had been hoodwinked by the law enforcement agency. The judge\u2019s harsh words got them to admit this was not the case. The judge insisted that Flynn concede that he was aware that lying to the FBI was a crime and that he was guilty of that offense. Flynn did so.\n\nDuring the hearing, special counsel prosecutor Brandon Van Grack made a noteworthy admission: that Flynn could have been charged as an undisclosed foreign lobbyist for the Turkish government, as two of his business associates were last week."

    "text": "Over the weekend the Niskanen Center, a Washington think tank with libertarian leanings, hosted a conference entitled \u201cStarting Over: The Center-Right After Trump.\u201d Writing in New York magazine, Jonathan Chait enthusiastically hailed the event as showing the outlines of how the GOP could become a responsible center-right party in the future.\n\nIt\u2019s true that there\u2019s much in the Niskanen\u2019s approach to politics to admire. They are calling for market solutions to intractable social problems, but eschewing the racism and nativism that has become a staple of right-wing politics. Further, Niskanen scholars are committed to accepting empirical reality on issues like climate change, even if they lead to policy solutions that require an un-libertarian acceptance of large-scale government intervention in the economy. The Niskanen approach to politics is summed up well in their manifesto, \u201cThe Center Can Hold: Public Policy for an Age of Extremes.\u201d\n\nChait was impressed enough to outline a fanciful scenario where Niskanen\u2019s approach comes to dominate the political right.\n\n\u201cOne can imagine a future in which the Democrats move toward socialism, opening a void in the center for the ideas espoused by Niskanen to take hold in something that perhaps shares the name, but otherwise none of the important ideological traits, of today\u2019s Republican Party,\u201d Chait writes. \u201cThat distant point probably lies years, even decades, away. It can only happen after today\u2019s Republican Party is destroyed, rendered incapable of wielding power at the national level, and its governing philosophy discredited completely. The Niskanen Center is the one institution planning for what can follow after the cleansing fire.\u201d\n\nChait himself presented a good argument against this scenario when he noted in The New Republic in 2012 that clever reformist policies get little traction in a Republican Party fully committed to revanchist politics. It\u2019s hard to see how Niskanen Center policy wonks will be able to overcome this problem.\n\nPolitical parties need constituencies as well as ideas. Who are the constituencies for the Niskanen Center\u2019s version of moderate libertarianism? Evangelical Christians, the backbone of the GOP, won\u2019t like the avoidance of cultural flashpoints. Nor is the business class likely to care for market reforms that challenge corporate rent-seeking and fiscal policy that calls for greater taxes to fight deficits.\n\nTrump has shown the GOP what its voters actually want: culture-war theater, white nationalism and tax cuts. Even if the Trump presidency ends in failure, the GOP is likely to try Trumpism without Trump. The future of the Republican Party is not the Niskanen Center. The future is much more likely to be President Tucker Carlson, with Stephen Miller as the head of the Department of Homeland Security."

    "text": "Australia\u2019s woeful defamation laws have even allowed Sydney to seize, from London, the title of \u201clibel capital of the world.\u201d Britain was notorious for its weak libel protections before Parliament heightened its standards in 2013. The Sydney Morning Herald reported last year that the Australian province of New South Wales, which includes Sydney, sees as many defamation lawsuits as England and Wales, which has eight times the population. Yael Stone, an actress who came forward this month with similar allegations against Rush, recently told the Times\u2019 Bari Weiss that she feared going public because of the potential legal hazards.\n\nAustralia\u2019s aversion to press freedom extends beyond libel laws. Earlier this month, a local court convicted Cardinal George Pell on five counts related to sexual-abuse charges that span decades. Pell, one of the most senior Catholic clergy ever accused of sexual abuse, was a prominent Vatican figure and a close adviser of Pope Francis until the allegations became public. His conviction was, by any definition, a major news story.\n\nBut Australian media outlets were barred by a judicial order from publishing any details about Pell\u2019s conviction. The result was surreal: Australian media outlets either obliquely referred to the conviction of an unnamed person, or simply chose not to report the news at all. The Daily Telegraph responded by publishing a front page that read \u201cIT\u2019S THE NATION\u2019S BIGGEST STORY\u201d with no other description of what happened and an editorial denouncing the state of affairs. Thanks to social media, many Australians were able to learn what happened, rendering the entire state of affairs even more absurd.\n\nEven foreign news outlets with reporters in Australia are affected. The New York Times published an unusual article on the quandary and its implications last week, all without mentioning any names. \u201cThe Times is not publishing the latest news of the case online, and it blocked delivery of the Friday print edition to Australia, to comply with the judge\u2019s order,\u201d reporter Damien Cave wrote. \u201cThe Times\u2019s lawyers in Australia have advised the organization that it is subject to local law because it maintains a bureau in the country.\u201d (The New Republic does not have an Australian bureau.)\n\nCave noted that Australian officials defend orders like these on the idea that suppressing media coverage is necessary to insulate potential jurors from bias. Pell, for instance, is expected to face more criminal trials in Australia related to the allegations against him. The American judicial system has much greater faith than its Australian counterpart in the average person\u2019s ability to render a verdict based on the evidence presented to them in open court. In extraordinary circumstances, a U.S. judge could simply order the jury to be sequestered for the duration of the trial. Depriving a handful of jurors of the free press is far preferable to depriving a nation of it.\n\nPress-freedom cases and legal thresholds for libel lawsuits aren\u2019t the sexiest topics in the world, but they play a profound and often invisible impact on a democratic society. They afford the less powerful members of society a measure of protection from the litigious whims of the wealthy and the well-connected. They help make possible a public discourse in which allegations of wrongdoing can be made without fear of reprisal and bankruptcy. And they tilt the playing field away from those who are most likely to abuse it.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that Trump is the foremost opponent of America\u2019s libel laws. His public and private life are defined by unsavory behaviors: allegations of tax evasion and consumer fraud, accounts of sexual misconduct by at least nineteen women, hush-money payments for two alleged extramarital affairs, and more. Trump has a lot to hide, and he\u2019s lamented his inability to hide it. But because the nation\u2019s libel laws are written at the state level and shaped by Supreme Court precedents, the president has virtually no power to change them.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t dissuaded him from threatening to do so. \u201cWe\u2019re going to open up those libel laws,\u201d he told supporters on the campaign trail. \u201cSo when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace or when The Washington Post, which is there for other reasons, writes a hit piece, we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they\u2019re totally protected.\u201d His frustration is a high compliment for the American approach to libel and press freedom, and a good example of why Australians should rethink theirs."

    "text": "The Hollywood Reporter has published an interview and profile of Christina Engelhardt, a 59-year-old woman who says she had a romantic relationship with the director Woody Allen which started in 1976 when she was 16 and he was 41. Under New York law in that era, Engelhardt (who then went by the name Babi) was under the age of consent\u201417\u2014when the relationship began. However, she was not a minor for most of the relationship\u2019s duration of eight years.\n\nThe relationship was a furtive and secretive one. \u201cThey operated under two key unspoken rules: There\u2019d be zero discussion about his work, and\u2014owing to the celebrity\u2019s presumed necessity for privacy\u2014they could only meet at his place,\u201d The Hollywood Reporter notes. Engelhardt claims she visited Allen\u2019s apartment more than 100 times, but never spent the night there. Instead, Allen\u2019s driver would take her away in a Rolls-Royce after each encounter.\n\nNor did she meet any of Allen\u2019s friends, with the exception of a few other girlfriends that Allen occasionally brought into their relationships to form a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois. In the words of the Reporter, she had a relationship of \u201cenforced seclusion.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s reason to think that the relationship, along with other affiliations Allen had with young women in that period, inspired his 1979 movie Manhattan.\n\nLooking back, Englehardt is ambiguous about the experience. \u201cI\u2019m not attacking Woody,\u201d she told the Reporter. \u201cThis is not \u2018bring down this man.\u2019 I\u2019m talking about my love story. This made me who I am. I have no regrets.\u201d But she also says \u201cit wasn\u2019t until after it was done when I really had time to think of how twisted it was when we were together \u2026 and how I was little more than a plaything.\u201d"

    "text": "The first episode opens in 1983 with a member of an underground dissident group being tortured for information. The interrogator goes up to the street level to take a smoke break, where the Palace of Culture and Science can be seen looming in the background. Moments later, a series of bombings unfold across the major cities of Poland (Warsaw, Krakow, Gdansk). The \u201cMarch 12 bombings,\u201d as they will become known, represent a watershed moment for the show\u2019s fictional Poland. The resistance movement was gaining ground by the early 1980s, and the collapse of the communist system was tending toward inevitability until the bombings happened.\n\nFlash forward to 2003 and the country is awash with 20th anniversary commemorations of the attacks. The state TV channel shows mourners laying wreathes on monuments to the victims \u201cwhose sacrifice,\u201d the announcer reads, \u201cpaved the way for the rebirth of our country and its peace and prosperity.\u201d It is against this backdrop of supposed national unity that the characters in 1983 uncover the reality of a deeply divided country where dissent has been erased through falsified autopsy reports and compromised criminal investigations. We follow as the show\u2019s two leads, the earnest young law student Kajetan Skowron (Musia\u0142) and the jaded police Inspector Anatol Janow (Wi\u0119ckiewicz), get to the bottom of the March 12th bombings and what really happened in 1983.\n\nWhen we meet Janow, he\u2019s leading a raid on the apartment of a banned books trader who\u2019s been selling illegal copies of Western books like 1984 and Harry Potter. The police arrive to find the suspect, a young man named \u0141ukasz Zi\u00f3\u0142ek, dead in what by all appearances is a suicide. Janow, however, becomes suspicious when he tries to access Zi\u00f3\u0142ek\u2019s government record, but is told he would need Level 1 clearance to do so (Level 1 demarcates ministers at the highest levels of the security service). Janow begins to suspect that was Zi\u00f3\u0142ek was a member of the Light Brigade, an underground network of young dissidents determined to overthrow the Party.\n\nMeanwhile, Janow\u2019s eventual partner, the law student Kajetan first appears onscreen in the middle of his final oral examination. Kajetan, a sharp student, responds accurately, but predictably to the questions posed, never doubting the authority of the Party in matters of justice. That is until one of the examiners, his mentor Professor Zurawski, warns him against placing too much faith in any man-made legal code, imploring him to look higher, to \u201ctruth.\u201d The truth about what? We soon learn that Zurawski, a former judge, oversaw a case where Janow was lead detective, a mysterious triple homicide that, like Zi\u00f3\u0142ek\u2019s apparent suicide, smacked of a political cover-up. The case file inspires Kajetan to seek out Janow. As the two men begin to connect the dots, the world of double agents and government conspiracies we have come to expect from political thrillers starts manifesting onscreen.\n\nA compelling and well-produced drama, the only real flaw of 1983 is unfortunately, its drastic disconnection from the politics of the present other than highly generalized references to authoritarianism. The show relies on a belief that the Cold War was a uniquely terrifying political reality that can serve as a kind of shorthand for all things bad. The mere mention of \u201cthe Party\u201d and \u201cMoscow\u201d are supposed to be spine chilling. That is a tough sell given the fresh horrors of our own moment, including as they have manifested in Poland. For the past three years, the country has been in the grip of a social crisis, with villains who pose a far more immediate danger than \u201cthe Soviets\u201d in the show."

    "text": "It\u2019s true that Elizabeth refused to marry or bear children, and that the resulting lack of an heir caused problems in her court. But framing the conflict between Elizabeth and Mary as one between an anxious, barren tyrant and a quick-witted underdog is just plain wrong. Rourke invents one scene in which Mary and Elizabeth meet in secret, exchanging their hopes and fears in some sort of secluded barn full of laundry. \u201cI was jealous,\u201d Elizabeth says to Mary, \u201cof your beauty, your bravery, your motherhood. You seem to surpass me in every way.\u201d\n\nThere are glorious moments in Mary Queen of Scots, as in every shot of Mary riding a spirited horse across Scottish hills bathed in sunlight and heather. But the barn scene is symptomatic of the schmaltz that has crept into this film, reducing its political complexity to quivering female lips.\n\nIn this flattening out of history into sentimental drama, the film resembles Netflix\u2019s The Outlaw King, about the life of Robert the Bruce, a direct ancestor of Mary (his grandson founded the House of Stuart, which was Mary\u2019s last name). As Kanishk Tharoor wrote in The Nation, \u201chistorical Robert the Bruce was as cynical and ruthless an opportunist as you could find,\u201d though The Outlaw King shows him leader of a monolithic band of Scots fighting an English occupation. The film frames Robert\u2019s supporters as a kind of fully-formed nation, which is misleading: \u201cLooking through the lens of the present,\u201d Tharoor writes, \u201cwe have a way of projecting modern national identities into the deep past.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Mary Queen of Scots smooths over the history of nationalism in Britain, and thus projects an origin story for the British nation-state that is less complicated than reality. The key lies in events that came after Mary\u2019s execution, and after Elizabeth\u2019s own death: In 1603, Mary\u2019s son James inherited the thrones of Scotland (as James VI) and England (as James I), which controlled Ireland. We call this event the Union of the Crowns. The two Acts of Union in the early eighteenth century formally bound the territory into one entity: \u201cUnited into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britain.\u201d In a very real sense, the plot of Mary Queen of Scots outlines the genesis of a United Kingdom whose long, long life, as I type this, appears to be spluttering to an end.\n\nWhat is \u201cunited\u201d about the United Kingdom in December of 2018? On Monday, British Prime Minister Theresa May canceled the Brexit vote she promised would take place on Tuesday, because she wasn\u2019t going to win it. The pound sterling started dropping. A rogue MP grabbed the ceremonial mace from the central table in Parliament and started waving it about. Pete Wishart of the Scottish National Party called Monday \u201cthe single biggest political crisis since Suez with the biggest capitulation since Napoleon\u2019s retreat from Moscow.\u201d"

    "text": "President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer strangely combined belligerence with concessions when he was interviewed on Sunday by George Stephanopoulos for ABC\u2019s This Week. While Giuliani made passionate arguments on behalf of the president, he also seemed to acknowledge major wrongdoing.\n\nAt one point, Giuliani attacked Michael Cohen, the president\u2019s former lawyer, for being disloyal:\n\nGiuliani: It shows all I\u2019m thinking about is me, my own skin. And the Southern District says you can get out of jail if you do this, you\u2019ve got three years now. There\u2019s a real motivation to sing like crazy. He\u2019s got to do a lot of singing to get out of the three years and he will say whatever he has to say. He\u2019s changed his story four or five times. Stephanopoulos: So has the president. Giuliani: The president\u2019s not under oath.\n\nIn this exchange, Giuliani manages to both echo gangster talk (\u201cmotivation to sing like crazy\u201d) and also admit the president has lied about the payments that Cohen made to two women with whom Trump allegedly had affairs.\n\nGiuliani also shifted the goalpost on the issue of whether longtime Trump crony Roger Stone provided then-candidate Trump with information about Wikileaks.\n\nStephanopoulos: And did Roger Stone ever give the president a heads-up on WikiLeaks\u2019 leaks -- leaks concerning Hillary Clinton, the DNC? Giuliani: No, he didn\u2019t. Stephanopoulos: Not at all? Giuliani: No. I don\u2019t believe so. But again, if Roger Stone gave anybody a heads-up about WikiLeaks\u2019 leaks, that\u2019s not a crime. It would be like giving him a heads-up that the Times is going to print something. One the -- the crime -- this is why this thing is so weird, strange -- the crime is conspiracy to hack; collusion is not a crime, it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nIt\u2019s striking that Giuliani quickly moves from outright denial (\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t.\u201d) to a much softer claim of no knowledge (\u201cNo. I don\u2019t believe so.\u201d).\n\nLike the president, Giuliani repeatedly fell back on the argument that \u201ccollusion is not a crime.\u201d Asked about Cohen providing evidence of contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign, the former New York city mayor said, \u201cI know that collusion is not a crime. It was over with by the time of the election.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs Jonathan Chait notes in New York, the oft-repeated refrain \u201ccollusion is not a crime\u201d is a bit of misdirection. \u201cThe Trumpian mantra, \u2018collusion is not a crime,\u2019 is a misleading legalism,\u201d Chait observes. \u201cThink of \u2018collusion\u2019 and \u2018crimes\u2019 as two large circles in a Venn diagram with a small overlap. Trump is being investigated for many crimes, and his campaign obviously colluded with Russia in multiple ways. Some of the alleged crimes, the overlapping portion of the Venn diagram, involve cooperating with the Russian election intervention.\u201d\n\n"

The Daily Beast reported on Thursday morning that the special counsel\u2019s inquiry is entering a new phase focused on influence from Middle Eastern countries. Later that evening, The Washington Post reported that final sentencing for some of Mueller\u2019s cooperating witnesses could indicate his investigation is nearing the end. Some have even speculated that the lack of charges against the Trump campaign itself may mean he hasn\u2019t found anything worth charging.\n\n\u201cInvestigators certainly know more than they\u2019re saying\u2014they often repeat as much in court appearances and documents in their various cases,\u201d NPR\u2019s Philip Ewing wrote on Saturday. \u201cBut an ostensible conspiracy between Trump\u2019s campaign and the Russians who attacked the election is nowhere near close to being proven.\u201d I\u2019ve argued previously that what\u2019s publicly available so far points toward soft collusion at a minimum: a mutually acknowledged confluence of interests between Trump and Moscow. At the same time, federal investigators have yet to formally allege hard collusion\u2014an explicit quid pro quo between the two sides.\n\nThis tension is a staple of the Russia investigation coverage. According to press reports in recent months, Mueller\u2019s inquiry has been at once expanding and narrowing, gaining steam and losing momentum, intensifying and \u201cwrapping up.\u201d Mueller himself has kept virtually silent about where his investigation is headed next or what form its conclusion will take, making him the most mysterious man in Washington. Unless he\u2019s prematurely ousted by the president, the American people won\u2019t find out what the special counsel is truly up to until it\u2019s all over.\n\nThis mystery may be by design, or merely the result of Mueller\u2019s sharpest tactical decisions: spinning off parts of his investigation to multiple U.S. attorneys\u2019 offices up and down the Eastern Seaboard. Indeed, it\u2019s no longer accurate to sum up the president\u2019s legal troubles under the banner of \u201cthe Russia investigation.\u201d The bulk of the federal investigatory firepower aimed at his inner circle is now coming from outside Mueller\u2019s control, widening the risk to the president himself."

He was the leading proponent of birtherism in 2011 and continued to promote the conspiracy theory publicly until 2015. (He reportedly has remained a birther in private.) Some believe Trump only decided to run for president because Obama made fun of him once. In declaring his candidacy, Trump described Obama as a \u201cnegative force\u201d who was \u201cnot a leader.\u201d And his campaign platform, such as it was, centered on undoing Obama\u2019s legacy: He pledged to reverse Obama\u2019s immigration policies, repeal Obamacare, and, in the words of running mate Mike Pence, undo \u201cevery single Obama executive order.\u201d\n\nHe has governed as promised. \u201cTrump is obsessed with Obama,\u201d New York Times columnist Charles Blow wrote last year, noting that \u201cmuch of what Trump has accomplished\u2014and it hasn\u2019t been much\u2014has been to undo Obama\u2019s accomplishments, like pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris climate agreement and reversing an Obama-era rule that helped prevent guns from being purchased by certain mentally ill people.\u201d He concluded, \u201cFor Trump, the mark of being a successful president is the degree to which he can expunge Obama\u2019s presidency.\u201d\n\nTwo years into Trump\u2019s presidency, however, it\u2019s clear that he aspires to undo more than just the Obama era. Some of his most high-profile actions have sought to reverse decades of progress\u2014by Democratic and Republican administrations alike\u2014in protecting the environment, workers\u2019 rights, and public health. If Trump succeeds, his own legacy won\u2019t be defined by his erasure of Obama\u2019s accomplishments so much as the destruction of the modern regulatory state as we know it.\n\nAndrew Wheeler, the acting administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, last week announced a plan to rewrite the Clean Water Rule, a 2015 regulation which ensured that small bodies of water like wetlands and streams would be protected by the Clean Water Act of 1972. But the new rule, if implemented, would do much more than just reverse an Obama-era protection. \u201cThis would be taking a sledgehammer to the Clean Water Act and rolling things back to a place we haven\u2019t been since it was passed,\u201d Blan Holman of the Southern Environmental Law Center told the Los Angeles Times."

    "text": "On Friday, The Weekly Standard was shuttered by its owners Clarity Media Group, bringing to an end the magazine\u2019s 23-year run as America\u2019s leading neoconservative publication. The news of the journal\u2019s demise raised some pressing questions: Was the closure politically motivated, with a Republican media company wanting to silence a magazine notorious for criticizing the president? Or was this, as some reports indicate, more of a business move, with Clarity planning on harvesting the Standard\u2019s mailing list for its planned launch of a Washington Examiner national magazine?\n\nPresident Donald Trump, for one, greeted the news with undisguised delight:\n\nThe pathetic and dishonest Weekly Standard, run by failed prognosticator Bill Kristol (who, like many others, never had a clue), is flat broke and out of business. Too bad. May it rest in peace! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 15, 2018\n\nSome who don\u2019t share Trump\u2019s politics echoed his dismissal of The Weekly Standard. Harvard international affairs scholar Stephen Walt pointed out the magazine\u2019s disastrous advocacy of the Iraq war:\n\nSeems to me if a magazine proudly lobbied for a disastrous war that cost 1000s of lives & trillions of $, it deserves to go out of biz. Its founders, editors, and chief writers deserve neither our sympathy nor our attention. #WeeklyStandard #accountability \u2014 Stephen Walt (@stephenWalt) December 15, 2018\n\nJournalist Glenn Greenwald, mocking a column by former Weekly Standard writer David Brooks, echoed Walt\u2019s argument:\n\nIn David Brooks' NYT eulogy of @weeklystandard, the word \"Iraq\" never appears, even though that war & the horrors that followed is, by far, the most consequential legacy of that magazine. People forget Brooks was one of the most unhinged warmongers there: https://t.co/hPsVku6d6c \u2014 Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) December 16, 2018\n\nThe column Greenwald criticized was an unusually angry one from the normally complacent and placid Brooks. The New York Times columnist claimed that, \u201cthis is what happens when corporate drones take over an opinion magazine, try to drag it down to their level and then grow angry and resentful when the people at the magazine try to maintain some sense of intellectual standards. This is what happens when people with a populist mind-set decide that an uneducated opinion is of the same value as an educated opinion, that ignorance sells better than learning.\u201d\n\nBrooks\u2019s critique of corporate culture was unexpected, since the conservative columnist is normally loath to criticize capitalism except in the vaguest terms. Brooks described Phil Anschutz, the owner of Clarity, as a \u201crun-of-the-mill arrogant billionaire.\u201d Brooks also added that, \u201cAnschutz, being a professing Christian, decided to close the magazine at the height of the Christmas season, and so cause maximum pain to his former employees and their families.\u201d\n\nThe most balanced assessment of The Weekly Standard\u2019s end came from Franklin Foer, writing in The Atlantic. Foer had personal reasons to resent the Standard, since he had been the victim at the hands of The Weekly Standard of what he calls \u201ca bad-faith effort to discredit stories about the war I had published as the editor of The New Republic.\u201d\n\n\n\nStill, Foer was able to put his memory of these attacks aside and praise the Standard for publishing, in addition to much neoconservative agitprop, much graceful, well-reported journalism.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s worth pausing to consider why a magazine like the Standard can be pleasurable and important, even to those who find its goals and methods noxious,\u201d Foer notes. \u201cIn part, it\u2019s the spectacle of watching lively minds on an expedition. The Standard would go off on quixotic missions, and not all of them in the desert of Iraq. Kristol promoted Colin Powell as a presidential candidate in 1996; then he cheered on John McCain\u2019s challenge to George W. Bush in 2000. The magazine enjoyed making mischief and enemies, which made its pages highly readable.\u201d"

The first took place on the first day of orientation for incoming House members, where about 200 protestors\u2014joined by Ocasio-Cortez\u2014staked out House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office and demanded the creation of a select committee for a Green New Deal. In response, Pelosi announced that she would support a new committee\u2014but did not say whether she would give the committee any power to craft legislation.\n\n\n\nHence the second, much larger action. On Monday, about 1,000 people flooded the Capitol to ask Democratic members of Congress to support the creation of a select committee with actual power to draft a Green New Deal. Some activists were also arrested after putting up a banner in front of Pelosi\u2019s office. In response to those protests, another senior Democratic leader\u2014Representative Jim McGovern\u2014said he would support the creation of a committee.\n\n50 days ago, @TheDemocrats told us that climate wasn't on the agenda for 2019.\n\n\n\nToday, every major Democratic leader is calling for ambitious climate action in 2019.\n\n\n\nLet's be clear: This happened because tens of thousands of us took bold action for a #GreenNewDeal. pic.twitter.com/DKvpto3zXk \u2014 Sunrise Movement \ud83c\udf05 (@sunrisemvmt) December 7, 2018\n\nThe Green New Deal protests have received some criticism because they target Democrats, not Republicans. \u201cWhy target Pelosi, who has always been a climate champion?\u201d Dave Roberts wrote for Vox last month. \u201cAren\u2019t there worse enemies of the climate to protest?\u201d But there\u2019s no denying that the protests have drawn national attention to an issue that\u2019s normally pushed to the side. An analysis released Tuesday by public affairs software company Quorum showed that this year, Democrats in Congress have talked about climate change more than they ever have.\n\nquorum.us\n\nPoliticians like Ocasio-Cortez and groups like the Sunrise Movement can\u2019t take all the credit for that. Some momentum is likely due to the sheer fact that climate change is getting worse. This year\u2019s record-breaking hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires \u201chave added new urgency to the discussion,\u201d Axios noted on Tuesday, as have \u201calarming new reports describing the damage that climate change may inflict on the planet in the future.\u201d Among the most worrisome was a United Nations report authored by international consortium of climate scientists, showing a strong risk of global crisis by 2040 if immediate, aggressive action isn\u2019t taken.\n\nAnd then, of course, there\u2019s Trump. As climate change worsens, to the increasing detriment of the economy, food system, national security, and human health, the president not only continues to deny that there\u2019s a crisis, but seems intent on exacerbating it. He is withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, and his administration has announced a staggering number of rollbacks of regulations on carbon emissions, fuel efficiency, clean air, pesticides, wilderness protection, oil and gas drilling, and much more. What\u2019s a better motivator for action than that?"

    "text": "EVENING IN PARADISE: MORE STORIES by Lucia Berlin Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 256 pp., $26.00\n\nWELCOME HOME: A MEMOIR WITH SELECTED PHOTOGRAPHS AND LETTERS by Lucia Berlin, edited by Jeff Berlin Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 176 pp., $25.00\n\nThis definition of the term marks Berlin\u2019s work as squarely autofictional. But her two new, posthumously published books also make it hard to find the line between autobiography and fiction, between a journal and a story, an anecdote and an event crafted into literature. Evening in Paradise is a selection of stories from the remaining, uncompiled pieces of Berlin\u2019s as-yet unpublished work, continuing the revival project started in A Manual for Cleaning Women, and reintroducing many of the same themes and even characters. Welcome Home, however, is directly concerned with the character of Berlin herself. It comprises mainly the unfinished memoir she had been working on at the time of her death, fleshed out with photos and letters from her personal correspondence, provided and assembled by her son Jeff. The two books twine together, forming out of fragments an astonishingly coherent project of recollection.\n\nIt is tempting to read an artist\u2019s work through the events of their life, or to read an artist\u2019s life with the goal of locating the themes of their work, to assume that one offers the clues to the meaning of the other. But Berlin seems to take this approach to the material of her own life, hunting through it like a detective turning over a few pieces of evidence again and again. The stories in Evening In Paradise are the same story, over and over. The same choices and tragedies play out again and again\u2014a very young woman marries a soon-to-be-famous sculptor, who leaves her while she is pregnant with their second child; a not-quite-as-young woman marries a rich, dashing man who turns out to be addicted to heroin; a couple in New Mexico struggle through the first year of their marriage on a property without electricity or running water; a young woman with several children cheats on her good, kind husband; the teenage daughter of an American mining engineer occupies high society in Chile and does her best to blithely ignore the imminent revolution.\n\nPeople have sex, they drink too much, they lose their money, they take jobs cleaning and teaching and tending bar and selling drugs to scrape by. People die, and leave, and miss each other. These same events occur and reoccur; the same stories are told in first person, then in third person, from the point of view of the future, and from that of the past, in immediacy and in regretful retelling. The names change, the personalities shift slightly. Characters transform depending on agenda of the narrator. The more one reads of Berlin\u2019s work, the more one begins to recognize the common threads, until every telling feels like a retelling, revealing a new facet of the same events, broadening and fleshing out the context.\n\n\n\nThese repeated stories are roughly a transcript of Berlin\u2019s life. Born in Alaska in 1936, she moved first to Montana, Idaho, and Texas with her family. In her teens, her father\u2019s mining business took the family to Chile, where she found herself part of wealthy pre-revolutionary high society. She returned to the States, to New Mexico, to attend college, and at age nineteen married Paul Suttman, a sculptor, who left her while she was pregnant with his second child. She married again twice, first to Race Newton, a jazz musician, with whom she moved to New York City, and through whom she was introduced into a group of musicians, artists, and writers that included Robert Creeley and Allen Ginsberg, and then to Buddy Berlin, with whom she lived in Albuquerque and Puerto Vallarta. Berlin\u2019s heroin addiction dominated and eventually destroyed their marriage. Berlin moved to Berkeley, California and worked numerous jobs including as a cleaning woman, while battling alcoholism, and writing sporadically. In the 1990s, finally sober, free of both booze and husbands, she taught writing at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and then spent the last few years of her life in Southern California, near her sons.\n\n\n\nBy the time one gets to Welcome Home, these events are familiar, and only their presentation is new; it is like seeing the blueprints for a house one has already walked around in, whose decorated rooms one has already visited. We all know people\u2014or are people\u2014who tell the same story about themselves over and over. These stories, the ones that act as calling cards and life rafts, often gain inconsistencies through their repeated retellings. We navigate through our lives by preparing a polished and curated version of our own autobiography, with pieces we have learned to recite as a way of acceptably explaining ourselves to the people we meet. We carry around our own plot summaries and footnotes. The more we tell these stories, the more they become fictional\u2014the act of telling taking over for the experience itself until only the former really exists."

    "text": "Pichai\u2019s testimony began with two members of House GOP leadership making the case that Google had grown too powerful. \u201cAccording to The Wall Street Journal, 90 percent of all searches go through Google,\u201d House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said at the start of the hearing. \u201cThat is power. It comes with responsibility.\u201d McCarthy appeared to be suggesting that Google\u2019s dominance was bad in part because it was being used to suppress conservative voices. Still, committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte picked up the baton, saying \u201cmost Americans have no idea the sheer volume of detailed information\u201d being swept up by the search engine\u2019s data collection efforts, which \u201cwould make the NSA blush.\u201d\n\nThis is a far cry from a simple charge of political bias. Goodlatte\u2019s remarks suggest that he\u2019s concerned about the company\u2019s monopoly on search and near-monopoly on targeted advertising not because of some unfounded censorship allegation, but because of the sheer market power concentrated in one company. Other Republicans appeared similarly uncomfortable with this prospect.\n\nIn an inspired bit of political theater, Representative Ted Poe held up his smartphone and asked a frazzled Pichai if Google would know if he moved across the hearing room to speak with his Democratic colleagues. Pichai, using his engineering background as a shield, told Poe he couldn\u2019t without knowing the particulars of the phone. It was an answer that didn\u2019t satisfy Poe, or anyone. \u201cI think the United States Congress needs to move in a direction to allow citizens to opt-in to the dissemination of their information rather than opt-out,\u201d Poe said. \u201cI think most Americans don\u2019t know all the things this phone can do.\u201d He concluded his testimony by advocating for the U.S. to adopt strict data protections like the ones implemented in the European Union earlier this year (the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR).\n\nTexas house representative Ted Poe got a little heated while questioning CEO Sundar Pichai about Google's data tracking capabilities. https://t.co/fwrEFCr8Tq pic.twitter.com/LdKPZnFpKi \u2014 USA TODAY Video (@usatodayvideo) December 11, 2018\n\nHouse Democrats were even more persistent in questioning Pichai about his company\u2019s data collection and privacy policies\u2014a sign of what\u2019s to come from the Judiciary Committee under Democratic leadership. Representative Ted Deutch spent his five minutes grilling the CEO about what information Google was collecting from its users, and whether the company believes it should be held accountable for the fake news and hate speech that are disseminated on its platforms, like YouTube. Incoming committee chair Jerry Nadler, meanwhile, focused on election interference, telling Pichai in his opening statement, \u201cWe should examine what Google is doing to stop hostile foreign powers from using its platform to spread false information to harm our political discourse.\u201d\n\n\n\nThese are the questions that the Judiciary Committee can be expected to pursue once the Democrats take charge in January: fake news, interference, and hate speech, but also privacy, data collection, and economic power. That\u2019s quite a lot for a committee that will also be launching investigations into President Trump.\n\n"

    "text": "On Tuesday, on live television, President Trump took ownership of a potential government shutdown over his demand for $5 billion in border wall funding. \u201cYou want to know something? I\u2019ll take it,\u201d Trump said, after being baited by Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. \u201cYes, if we don\u2019t get what we want one way or the other, whether it\u2019s through you, through military, through anything you want to call\u2014I will shut down the government. I am proud to shut down the government. I will take the mantle.\u201d\n\n.@realDonaldTrump has the Senate, the White House, and the House (for the moment) under Republican control. He has the power to keep government open \u2013 but instead, he says he\u2019s going to shut down the government. #TrumpShutdown pic.twitter.com/Pdbo4rH0sG \u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) December 11, 2018\n\nDemocrats and their allies spiked the football, praising the negotiating prowess of Pelosi and Schumer. \u201cShe\u2019s damn good!\u201d Congressman Mark Pocan told reporters, referring to Pelosi. \u201cPersonally, you don\u2019t want to ever be on the other side of a negotiation with her, because you\u2019re at a disadvantage.\u201d New York magazine\u2019s Jonathan Chait argued that Trump\u2019s preemptive ownership of a government shutdown was a historic gaffe. \u201cIf Schumer was playing three-dimensional chess, the game was won as he slowly contemplated his first move while his opponent stuffed his pieces into his own mouth and choked to death,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIt does seem like a huge victory. Shutdown fights often revolve around which party will take the blame; with Trump having already taken credit, it would seem that Democrats can just sit on their hands. But Trump has long flouted the rules that Schumer and Pelosi live by, and it has gotten him this far. Moreover, he\u2019s threatening to shut down the government over a key campaign promise that remains very popular with his base. If the government does shut down, he\u2019ll blame Schumer and Pelosi for refusing to take border security seriously, and his supporters will side with him.\n\nTrump designed Tuesday\u2019s Oval Office meeting to be a spectacle. \u201cAlthough aides often urge him to keep such meetings closed to the public, The Washington Post reports, \u201cTrump likes the visual of him at the center of a room leading a meeting with lawmakers because he looks like he is \u2018in charge,\u2019 according to a former White House official.\u201d When Pelosi and Schumer asked to meet behind closed doors, Trump refused. Nonetheless, all three of them may have gotten what they wanted. Schumer and Pelosi got a soundbite of the president taking responsibility for a government shutdown that could impact millions of Americans, while Trump got to show how seriously he takes border security (in contrast to Schumer and Pelosi, he argues)."

    "text": "The political barriers to getting Parliament\u2019s approval still seem insoluble: In order to guarantee that no hard border will be introduced between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland (which is part of the UK) even if the UK and the EU do not reach a trade agreement, May\u2019s plan provides for a last resort wherein there would be special conditions for Northern Ireland and the whole of the UK would remain in a customs union with the EU\u2014something that negates the whole point of Brexit, according to Brexit supporters, and displeases the Northern Irish Party propping up May\u2019s minority government. May hopes she can renegotiate that part of the deal with the EU, but the EU has ruled out renegotiation. Even if the EU were to change its mind, it remains unlikely than a new deal would be different enough for Parliament to vote it through.\n\nPart of why Rousseau was skeptical of representative democracy was because he thought elected representatives could not possibly do justice to what the general will dictated. Indeed, MPs on both sides of the Brexit debate indicated they would vote down May\u2019s deal because they saw it as misrepresenting the referendum result.\n\nOverturning an older vote with a new one is hardly undemocratic; it is in fact the essence of democracy.\n\nThe democratic solution to this yawning gap between what the people voted for and what their politicians are capable of procuring for them, of course, would be a second referendum. May, however, is convinced that a second referendum would be undemocratic: that those calling for a second referendum are also those who voted no in the first one, and would prefer to stop Brexit altogether, disrespecting the people\u2019s 2016 choice.\n\nViewed abstractly, overturning an older vote with a new one is hardly undemocratic; it is in fact the essence of democracy, allowing a people to adapt to new circumstances. It would indeed be undemocratic for the 2016 referendum to be overturned by a less democratic process, such as a parliamentary vote. But in a competition between two identical democratic processes, capturing the general will at two different times, opposing a new referendum could only be justified by placing greater value on the votes cast in 2016 than those which would be cast today. That hardly seems democratic. It also seems contrary to the spirit of the UK\u2019s constitutional principle according to which no past Parliament\u2019s decision can bind its successors.\n\nOthers opposing a second referendum say that regardless of the second vote\u2019s merits, it would be perceived as undemocratic by voters, resulting in a loss of faith in the political system, endangering its democracy. The relevant question, though, is what effect the absence of a second referendum would have on people\u2019s perception of democracy. Given that the chances of new modifications on the deal seem slim, the alternatives for Parliament would be to either approve a no-deal Brexit, or to unilaterally stop the entire Brexit process, something that on Monday the European Court of Justice ruled is an option for the UK. Either of those two results are in greater danger of being perceived as undemocratic than any second referendum result would, and justifiably so."

    "text": "Buckley wasn\u2019t being flippant. He was being honest. Conservatives really did have no interest in social policy. National Review writers excelled at philosophical theory and high rhetoric, but when the subject turned to \u201ca crucial policy issue such as Medicare, you publish a few skimpy and haughty paragraphs,\u201d Buckley\u2019s friend Irving Kristol complained in 1964, when it was clear some kind of national health care for the elderly was going to be enacted, expanding the popular protections in Social Security. \u201cWhy not five or six pages, in which several authorities spell out the possible provisions of such a bill?\u201d Kristol urged. \u201cIt could really affect the way we live now.\u201d Buckley wasn\u2019t interested, and Kristol plugged the hole himself with The Public Interest, the quarterly he founded with Daniel Bell in 1965. It was one of the era\u2019s best journals, filled with well-written analysis and incisive commentary on the entire range of midcentury policy. But in the end, Buckley was right. As Rosenfeld says, it was National Review that gave direction to the conservative revolution and made the GOP better organized and more ideologically unified than the \u201cpolarizers\u201d of the \u201940s and \u201950s could imagine.\n\nBuckley\u2019s brother-in-law, L. Brent Bozell, was a key figure in translating these ideas into political strategy. He brilliantly repackaged Buckley\u2019s \u201cNo-program\u201d in a tract he ghostwrote for Barry Goldwater, The Conscience of a Conservative, meant to launch a shot-across-the-bow challenge to Nixon in 1960. In a famous passage, Bozell and Goldwater project a vision of the ideal \u201cman in office,\u201d the savior of the Republic, who tells the people,\n\nI have little to no interest in streamlining government or in making it more efficient, for I mean to reduce its size. I do not undertake to promote welfare for I propose to extend freedom. My aim is not to pass laws, but to repeal them.\n\nWhen the book became a best-seller and the guessing game of authorship began, Goldwater insisted he had written it\u2014or that it grew out of his speeches and published writings (never mind that they\u2019d been ghosted too). Under normal conditions, few would have cared\u2014John F. Kennedy didn\u2019t write his books either. But Goldwater was being marketed as a bold political thinker. Rosenfeld perpetuates this myth, the better to present Goldwater as a serious-minded intellectual who \u201cframed his positions on disparate issues within an overarching ideological vision.\u201d That vision consisted of libertarian economics at home and militant anti-Communism abroad. Goldwater didn\u2019t come close to getting the nomination. Nixon did, as expected, and then lost, barely, to John F. Kennedy\u2014another victory for the liberal Establishment.\n\nRonald Reagan and Barry Goldwater join William F. Buckley and his brother at a National Review party. Bettmann/Getty\n\nGoldwater was too good a politician to chain himself to a single script, especially a losing script. It was dawning on some that Kristol had got one big thing right. The public really did want government programs, as long as the benefits accrued to them and not someone else. In early 1961, getting a jump on the next election, a second Goldwater ghostwriter, Michael Bernstein, drafted a prescient document, the \u201cGoldwater Manifesto\u201d or \u201cForgotten American\u201d speech. It sketched out the beginnings of what later came to be called big-government conservatism\u2014a reordering of spending away from the poor and minorities (singled out for help by Kennedy\u2019s New Frontier) and toward a newly aggrieved group, \u201cthe silent Americans,\u201d who truly \u201cconstitute the substantial majority of our people\u201d and yet \u201ccannot find voice against the mammoth organizations which mercilessly pressure their own membership, the Congress, and society as a whole for objectives which these silent ones do not want.\u201d\n\nWhat might the silent ones want instead? For one thing, Bernstein proposed, \u201ctax relief for families with children attending college.\u201d NR purists were appalled. This was still Big Brother\u2014manna flowing from the Beltway\u2014even if, in this case, the money was going back to overburdened taxpayers. In embarrassment, Goldwater backed away and made a new calculation. The most numerous \u201csilent\u201d votes were to be had in the South. White majorities there felt disrespected or worse by the presidencies of Kennedy and his successor, Lyndon Johnson. Civil rights was the pivotal issue, but not the only one. In fact, it overlapped with other tensions: in labor unions, public education, housing, anti-colonial uprisings abroad. Below the calm surface of consensus, a deeper struggle was going on. \u201cThere is a vague and bitter counter-revolution in this country\u2014anti-big government, anti-union, anti-high taxation, anti-Negro, anti-foreign aid, and anti-the whole complex spirit of modern American life,\u201d James Reston, The New York Times\u2019 Washington bureau chief and most respected columnist, wrote in 1963, when Goldwater was the uncrowned king of an increasingly conservative GOP. The center that Schattschneider and Burns had counted on was coming apart.\n\nWhat Reston missed was the sophistication of Goldwater\u2019s rhetoric, helped along by the writings of Buckley, Bozell, and Bernstein. He overlooked as well the Southern strategy devised by NR\u2019s publisher, William Rusher. It wasn\u2019t a new idea. Goldwater\u2019s first stab at the presidency, in 1960, had begun in South Carolina, when he won the delegates at the state Republican convention, catching Nixon off-guard. It was his first successful \u201cduck hunting\u201d expedition\u2014that is, courting the votes of middle-class whites in the \u201cNew South,\u201d with its rising business class. Uncomfortable with the overt race-baiting of Dixiecrats, these voters responded to a broader argument cast in the language of states\u2019 rights and free enterprise, the true pillars of the constitutional republic as opposed to the Democrats\u2019 promise of egalitarian democracy. You could make this case, and Goldwater did, without mentioning race at all. Buckley made the same adjustment. Instead of saying black people were inferior\u2014National Review\u2019s line in the 1950s\u2014he now argued that Goldwater \u201cdoes not intend to diminish the rights of any minority groups\u2014but neither does he desire to diminish the rights of majority groups.\u201d\n\nWhile Democrats had become the party of civil rights, the Republican Party, without explicitly saying so, \u201cwas now a White Man\u2019s Party,\u201d as Robert Novak put it in his account of the 1964 election, The Agony of the G.O.P. The transformation began in earnest when Senator Strom Thurmond quit the Democratic Party, taking South Carolina\u2019s electoral votes with him, and was welcomed into the GOP by his good friend Goldwater. Thurmond the defecting Democrat was joined by younger Southern politicians nourished within the GOP. These were figures like James Martin, who challenged and nearly unseated Lister Hill, the four-term incumbent Democratic senator in Alabama, in 1962. Martin was elected to the House in 1964, together with five others from the South, four of them from states\u2014Tennessee, Texas, Florida, and Kentucky\u2014that today contribute to the GOP\u2019s base. Canny operatives like the Alabama prodigy John Grenier (oddly absent from Rosenfeld\u2019s book) rose to top positions in Goldwater\u2019s campaign. Its victories came almost entirely from the Deep South.\n\nWhile Democrats had become the party of civil rights, the Republican Party, without explicitly saying so, \u201cwas now a White Man\u2019s Party.\u201d\n\nOutside the South (and his home state, Arizona), Goldwater got a thrashing in 1964. But he had opened up the route to what the political strategist Kevin Phillips soon called the \u201cemerging Republican majority,\u201d which nationalized the Southern strategy by courting alienated white voters in the North as the civil rights movement moved there; by focusing on racially charged issues like \u201cforced busing\u201d and the integration of labor unions, the GOP drove a wedge in what had once been Democratic strongholds. In 1968, Richard Nixon dusted off Bernstein\u2019s \u201cforgotten man\u201d speech and made it the template for his appeal to the \u201csilent majority,\u201d as Garry Wills reported in his classic Nixon Agonistes. Like Goldwater, Nixon cast tribal politics in lofty ideological terms. He talked of \u201cpositive polarization\u201d and promised to overturn \u201cthe false unity of consensus, of the glossing over of fundamental differences, of the enforced sameness of government regimentation.\u201d Ronald Reagan, preparing to run in 1976, went even further, warning that if Republicans continued \u201cto fuzz up and blur\u201d the differences between the two parties when they should be \u201craising a banner of no pale pastels, but bold colors,\u201d he might quit the GOP and form a third party. Instead he contested and badly weakened the incumbent Gerald Ford. Four years later, Reagan repeated the Goldwater and Nixon formula, rechristening the \u201cforgotten American\u201d and \u201csilent majority\u201d as the \u201cmoral majority,\u201d and won in a landslide.\n\nFor all this talk of the fundamental differences between the parties, however, partisanship did not yet reach today\u2019s poisonous extreme. Nixon and Reagan, experienced leaders, ran \u201cagainst\u201d government while also realizing there were very few programs the voting public would be willing do without. Once in office, Republicans too were expected to make the system work. Democrats, with their long history of taking public policy seriously, were, however, better at it\u2014as some conservatives acknowledged. In his influential book Suicide of the West, Buckley\u2019s colleague James Burnham quoted Michael Oakeshott, who said fixing social problems was the liberal\u2019s ambition, or delusion. While the liberal \u201ccan imagine a problem which would remain impervious to the onslaught of his own reason,\u201d Oakeshott wrote, \u201cwhat he cannot imagine is politics which do not consist in solving problems.\u201d The conservatives\u2019 job was to apply the brakes when necessary, to keep alive the opposition argument in a world in which all knew liberalism remained the basis of modern governance but weren\u2019t always prepared to admit it.\n\nThis broad but tacit acceptance of activist government is what inspired the Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan to take a job in Nixon\u2019s administration in 1969. He gambled that a moderate Republican, who said he disliked government but realized voters wanted it, might succeed in passing legislation where Democrats had failed. Despite encountering resistance from the \u201ccongressional majority,\u201d Moynihan was vindicated. The Nixon years gave us a good deal of effective government. They saw the creation of the EPA, wage-and-price controls, the Equal Employment Opportunity Act, Supplemental Social Security income (for the blind, disabled, and elderly), Pell Grants (college loans for lower-income students), the Endangered Species Act, and more. It was a \u201crich legislative record,\u201d as the political scientist David Mayhew has written. The reason is conveyed in the title of Mayhew\u2019s book, Divided We Govern, which showed how well government worked when voters split tickets and gave each party control of a different branch.\n\nRosenfeld\u2019s thesis\u2014that the postwar enthusiasm for ideologically unified parties yielded some positive good\u2014works better when he turns to the Democratic Party, which really did clean house, cutting loose Southern reactionaries to make itself the party of civil rights. Stalwarts of the Senate \u201ccitadel\u201d like Harry F. Byrd and Richard Russell lingered, but with diminished authority as civil rights became the party\u2019s great cause, and Northern liberals\u2014the Minnesotans Hubert Humphrey and Eugene McCarthy, to name two, and the Prairie populist George McGovern\u2014gained national followings. There were also the brave organizing efforts of college students, white and black, who mobilized citizens in the South. Rosenfeld has very good pages on the 1964 Democratic convention, when members of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, led by the activists Bob Moses and Fannie Lou Hamer, challenged the Dixiecrats. Their victory was symbolic, but politics is often written in symbols.\n\n\n\nOne wishes Rosenfeld had more to say about other political figures, particularly black leaders such as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Julian Bond, and Shirley Chisholm, who guided the Democrats\u2019 response to the most important polarization in America. Kendall\u2019s \u201ctwo majorities\u201d\u2014one \u201cpresidential,\u201d the other \u201ccongressional\u201d\u2014only grazed the surface of a nation profoundly split into \u201ctwo societies, one black, one white\u2014 separate and unequal,\u201d to quote one of the period\u2019s great public documents, The Kerner Report. Published in 1968 after a year of investigation by a presidential advisory commission, the report explored the causes of the urban disorder in almost 150 cities\u2014especially Detroit and Newark\u2014in the summer of 1967.\n\nIn April 1968, while the Kerner commission findings were still being digested, King was assassinated, and the two societies hardened along lines that prefigure today\u2019s jagged divisions. Trump\u2019s truest forerunner, many have pointed out, was the one true radical in the 1968 presidential campaign, the Alabama segregationist George Wallace, a lifelong Democrat who ran on a third-party ticket and preached a Trump-like gospel of revenge. \u201cThe desire for \u2018law and order\u2019 is nothing so simple as a code for racism,\u201d Garry Wills wrote of Wallace\u2019s message at the time. \u201cIt is a cry, as things begin to break up, for stability, for stopping history in mid-dissolution.\u201d Fifty years ago, \u201cmiddle America\u201d already yearned to make their country \u201cgreat\u201d again.\n\nIn truth it was becoming great\u2014or better, anyway. Rosenfeld\u2019s book, though the last pages rush through the years between 2000 and 2016, says very little about President Barack Obama, whose two terms were a model of \u201cresponsible party\u201d politics, ideologically moored but also pragmatic and aimed at the broad middle of the electorate. It led to much good policy, and to the strong economy that is now buoying Trump\u2019s presidency. Why does Rosenfeld have nothing to say about Obama? One answer might be that Obama was detached from the Democratic base: It steadily eroded during his two terms, especially at the all-important state level, as Nicole Narea and Alex Shephard wrote soon after Trump was elected. The Republicans, meanwhile, had diligently rebuilt from the bottom up, bringing about today\u2019s \u201crelentless dynamics of party polarization\u201d and a climate of \u201cfactional chaos.\u201d\n\nRosenfeld blames our current partisan gridlock on the system\u2019s \u201clogic of line-drawing.\u201d But he also warns that \u201cany plausible alternatives to the rigidities and rancor of party polarization might well prove to be something more chaotic and dangerous.\u201d What can he mean? He points to the dangers of \u201cpragmatic bargaining\u201d and to the unprincipled compromises that might take the place of \u201ceffective policymaking.\u201d This, he worries, would leave us with the same problems Schattschneider and Burns identified decades ago. Yet the last half-century of legislative history suggests something very different: The only coherent policies we\u2019ve seen in decades\u2014from the great civil rights legislation of the 1960s through Medicare and then Reagan\u2019s tax reform in the 1980s\u2014owe their passage to exactly the bipartisanship Rosenfeld finds corrupting. The lone recent instance of one-party rule creating a powerful piece of legislation is the Affordable Care Act, and the bill was vulnerable to attack precisely because no Republicans in either the House or the Senate voted for it and so had no stake in protecting it.\n\nIn one important way, however, Rosenfeld could be right about the ultimate benefits of polarization. In the Desolation Row of the Trump era, \u201cWhich side are you on?\u201d has become the paramount question. Trump\u2019s coarseness has invigorated the forces of resistance: A politer figure would not have given us the Access Hollywood tape, and the brazen denials afterward, and would not have fed the outrage that burst into public consciousness with the \u201cMe Too\u201d movement. So too Trump and Paul Ryan\u2019s failure to come up with a workable replacement for Obamacare\u2014a failure rooted in half a century of a \u201cNo-program program\u201d\u2014has given Democrats one of their most potent issues in the midterms. And the excesses of House Republicans, especially the foot soldiers in the Freedom Caucus, may well create opportunities for another disciplined group whose presence has been growing on the other side, the Congressional Black Caucus. If these changes come, polarization will be a major reason. The most enduring accomplishment of Trump and Trumpism\u2014 the latest, most decadent stage of the American right\u2014could be the rebirth of an authentic American left."

    "text": "The same bombers had previously tossed a firebomb into an ROTC classroom at the university. And a few days before the 1970 New Year, they stole a plane and dropped a series of explosives onto a nearby ammunition plant. Nicknamed \u201cThe New Year\u2019s Gang,\u201d they were lionized as romantic heroes by Wisconsin\u2019s student newspaper and other protesters at the university.\n\nBut after the destruction of the math building and the death of the physics student, a 33-year-old father of three, protesters changed their tune. The bombing \u201cwas so extreme and unjustifiable and horrible, it stopped us in our tracks,\u201d one activist said. Another noted that the attack \u201ccaused a lot of soul searching.\u201d It was \u201ca very pointed reminder . . . that you can\u2019t persuade people of the sanctity of human life by being recklessly unmindful of human life.\u201d\n\nWhen will Republicans search their own souls about the reckless rhetoric that provoked Sayoc and Bowers? Several GOP senators have released generic statements denouncing violence and calling for civility. But all of these comments ring hollow when they exempt the man who has done more than anybody else to encourage violence and erode civility. \u201cLook, everyone has their own style. And frankly, people on both side of the aisle use strong language about our political differences,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence told NBC News on Saturday. \u201cBut I just don\u2019t think you can connect it to threats or acts of violence.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that Congresswoman Maxine Waters and a few other Democrats in Congress have engaged in their own kinds of incivility, such as calling on supporters to confront Trump administration officials in restaurants. But the Democratic leadership has unequivocally condemned their behavior.\n\nI\u2019m not expecting Republicans to stop supporting Trump\u2019s policies, just as the protesters in Wisconsin weren\u2019t about to abandon their opposition to the Vietnam War over the actions of the New Year\u2019s Gang. But not a single prominent Republican has stood up over the past few days to state the obvious: Trump\u2019s violent rhetoric encourages violent action.\n\nDecent people can endorse Trump\u2019s views on immigration, health care, taxes, and so on, but decent people do not speak and act like he does. It\u2019s time for Republican leaders to say that, clearly and unequivocally. If they don\u2019t, they will be complicit in any further right-wing political violence that mars the country\u2014and will be remembered as cowards and opportunists, who put their own immediate political concerns above the fate of America."

    "text": "New Orleans English can be confusing to those who aren\u2019t familiar with it. \u201cSome of them speak with a familiar, Southern drawl; others sound almost like they\u2019re from Brooklyn,\u201d Jesse Sheidlower, the former editor-at-large of the Oxford English Dictionary, wrote in a definitive explainer of the dialect in 2005, shortly after Katrina. \u201cWhy do people in New Orleans talk that way?\u201d\n\nThe \u201crich level of linguistic diversity\u201d in New Orleans stems, in part, from its diverse migrants, he wrote. There were the French and Acadian settlers, of course, as well as Spanish, German, Irish and Italian immigrants. New Orleans was also \u201ca gateway for the slave states, which brought in speakers of a variety of African languages.\u201d The result was the hodgepodge of subdialects that exist there today, which change depending on the neighborhood or ethnic group.\n\nThe 24 regions of American English, according to Long Island University\u2019s Robert Delaney. Robert Delaney\n\nCarmichael can\u2019t yet say specifically how New Orleans English has changed since Katrina. But last week, the National Science Foundation awarded a $250,000 grant to Carmichael to explore her hypothesis, along with Tulane University linguistics professor Nathalie Dajko. Together, they \u201cwill interview 200 lifelong residents of different ethnic backgrounds and neighborhood origins to collect the largest and most diverse data sample ever assembled in the city,\u201d according to a press release. The results could help researchers predict other dialect changes that might occur as sea-level rise and more severe storms force Americans away from the places that once shaped their speech.\n\nCarmichael\u2019s hypothesis is based on two known impacts of Katrina that are also known to spur dialect changes: Widespread displacement of native speakers from the region and widespread migration of non-native speakers into it.\n\nKatrina\u2019s flooding displaced 400,000 people\u2014nearly the entire population of the city. A year later, only about 53 percent of those people had returned\u2014\u201cless than a third at the home they\u2019d lived in prior to Katrina,\u201d according to CityLab. Today, the city has around 80 percent of the population it once had, but it\u2019s been difficult to track with precision how many are newcomers and how many are longtime residents. But one thing is for sure: New Orleans is a smaller, whiter city than it used to be. There is thus concern that some New Orleans subdialects could be at risk of disappearing. After all, Carmichael said, \u201cSome of our major cities in the South no longer sound Southern because economic prosperity brought Northerners in.\u201d"

    ],
    "text": "A Georgia paper screeched in November 1871 that the Klan \u201chas existence only in the imaginations of President Grant and the vile politicians who have poisoned his ears with false and malicious reports... The reports of collisions between armed bands of Ku-klux and federal troops are utterly false, base, and slanderous fabrication, uttered for a purpose.\u201d Rather than retreat and regroup as more evidence slammed their position, those who were invested in believing that there was not a pattern of extreme violence against southern Republicans stood firm. As the Daily Augustus Gazette reported summing up the Ku-Klux trials, \u201cAnd now, after all this has been done, and after the expenditure of a vast amount of the public money, a skeptical public are less disposed than ever to believe in the existence of a Ku-Klux organization\u2026. True, numbers of prisoners when brought to trial have confessed\u2026. and there has been an unlimited supply of evidence to the same effect taken, but it could not deceive anyone who desired to know the truth of the matter.\u201d\n\nKlan denialism and skepticism took root in a civic soil that was primed to receive it. Americans in the post-Civil War era lived in a changing information ecosystem thanks to technological advances and logistical changes brought about by the conflict. The average citizen had access to a steady stream of information from newspapers, telegraphs, and word of mouth among an increasingly transitory public. Editors and newspaper owners still operated as partisan actors, Parsons noted, but the surge in newsworthy information forced them to decide what to print and what to omit. These changes gave some Americans a new reason to distrust sensational information that they came across and question why certain stories were presented to them.\n\nSome Americans of the era may have genuinely struggled with the idea that such a group could exist. Others downplayed its acts or discredited its victims for political purposes: Democratic politicians and newspapers aimed to undermine President Ulysses S. Grant and the Radical Republicans to weaken support for their Reconstruction policies. Liberal Republicans, led by New York publisher Horace Greeley, turned toward Klan skepticism in their bid to reassert control over the party. And Northern journalists sometimes veered into sensationalism when covering the Klan\u2019s acts, a habit that made it harder for Americans to distinguish between genuine accounts of Klan savagery and fictional ones.\n\n\u201cIt was a particularly ugly display of human nature, and the worst thing about it was precisely that it was not in the least mysterious,\u201d Parsons concluded. \u201cKu-Klux and their suffering victims were all too human and all too plainly visible to anyone who had the fortitude to look. Folding Reconstruction-era violence into the Ku-Klux, imagining it as spectral, ambiguous, and indeterminate, enabled Americans to turn away from that unjust reality and all of the political implications and obligations that it entailed.\u201d\n\nThere is no official death toll for the era\u2019s spasmodic violence, which continued through other groups following the Klan\u2019s decline after federal enforcement peaked in 1872. Contemporary estimates ran high: Robert Smalls, a black congressman and hero of the Civil War, told South Carolina\u2019s constitutional convention in 1895 that 53,000 African Americans had been murdered throughout the South since emancipation. What\u2019s easier to ascertain is that assassinations, massacres, and intimidation by the Klan and other groups worked. \u201cReconstruction did not fail; in regions where it collapsed it was violently overthrown by men who had fought for slavery during the Civil War and continued that battle as guerrilla partisans over the next decade,\u201d historian Douglas R. Egerton wrote in The Wars of Reconstruction. \u201cDemocratic movements can be halted through violence.\u201d\n\nPolitical violence by right-wing and white supremacist groups is nowhere near as widespread today, of course. But it still exists. Republican elected officials and conservative media outlets spent the Obama years downplaying the growing threat. In 2009, a Department of Homeland Security analysis warned about a possible uptick in right-wing violence after the Great Recession began. Republicans responded by successfully pressuring the department to rescind the report.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s election only emboldened the most extreme elements of American society, and he appears to welcome the phenomenon. He frequently signals to his supporters that his disavowals of white-nationalist groups and other right-wing racists are not genuine. After a white-nationalist march in Charlottesville turned deadly last summer, he declared that there were \u201csome very fine people\u201d on both sides. Political figures across the ideological spectrum condemned his remarks, but white nationalists responded with joy. David Duke, a former leader of the Klan\u2019s modern incarnation, praised Trump for his courage.\n\nThe president\u2019s rhetoric reached its logical conclusion on Saturday when a gunman murdered eleven Jewish worshippers at a Pittsburgh synagogue. Robert Bowers, the alleged killer, had invoked anti-Semitic conspiracy theories online. \u201cHIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people,\u201d he wrote on Gab, a social networking platform that\u2019s popular among white nationalists, shortly before the massacre. \u201cI can\u2019t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I\u2019m going in.\u201d\n\nHIAS, originally known as the Hebrew Immigration Aid Society, is a Jewish nonprofit group that helps bring refugees to the United States. It\u2019s a common conspiracy theory among white nationalists that Jewish people are trying to replace America\u2019s white population with nonwhite immigrants. Trump and his allies have espoused variants of this theory, often centered on Jewish billionaire and Democratic donor George Soros, who was among last week\u2019s mail-bomb targets. The president has frequently hyped the migrant caravan traveling toward the U.S. as a purported threat to American security and even falsely asserted that \u201cMiddle Eastern individuals\u201d were among the migrants, with the racist implication that they were terrorists.\n\nTrump responded to Saturday\u2019s shooting in Pittsburgh by condemning this \u201cwicked act of mass murder\u201d and anti-Semitism in general, but a day later he shifted responsibility for the bloodshed to mainstream news outlets.\n\nThe Fake News is doing everything in their power to blame Republicans, Conservatives and me for the division and hatred that has been going on for so long in our Country. Actually, it is their Fake & Dishonest reporting which is causing problems far greater than they understand! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2018\n\nDenial can take many forms. On Monday morning, as her boss faced accusations that he\u2019s culpable for the violence, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway tried to craft an alternative explanation for it.\n\n\u201cThe anti-religiosity in this country that is somehow in vogue and funny, to make fun of anybody of faith, to be constantly making fun of people who express religion, the late night comedians, the unfunny people on TV shows\u2014it\u2019s always anti-religious,\u201d she told Fox and Friends. \u201cThese people were gunned down in their place of worship, as were the people in South Carolina a couple of years ago, and they were there because they\u2019re people of faith, and it\u2019s that faith that needs to bring them together. This is no time to be driving God out of the public square.\u201d\n\n\n\nConway\u2019s proposition is unmoored from reality. Dylann Roof, the young white man who murdered nine black parishioners in a Charleston church in 2015, left a racist manifesto online before the shooting. The common theme between these acts of violence is white nationalism, not late-night comedians.\n\nIn many ways, Trump is unlike any other president who came before him. But his approach to American politics is not wholly without precedent. There\u2019s nothing new or special about his use of denialism, falsehoods, and bad-faith attempts to shift blame onto his political adversaries. Reconstruction\u2019s failure shows that national campaigns to deceive and mislead the public about white-nationalist violence have worked before. This country is about to find out whether they will work again."

    "text": "Schiff also suggested that the House Judiciary Committee would focus on \u201cpotential abuse of the pardon power [and] attacks on the rule of law,\u201d which could include Trump\u2019s daily attacks on the FBI, his tampering in FBI investigations, and the pardons he reportedly floated to his former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and one-time campaign chief Paul Manafort, before both entered plea agreements and started cooperating with Mueller.\n\nIf Democrats win the House, Rep. Adam Schiff will likely play a central role in the House\u2019s investigations into Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 election. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nSchiff suggested his own committee would examine Russian financial influence over the president, which could cover Trump\u2019s various business dealings in Russia. But it\u2019s also likely that the Financial Services Committee, under Rep. Maxine Waters of California, would conduct much of that work.\n\nIn March, Schiff and the other Democrats on the Intelligence Committee released a status report naming witnesses Republicans had refused to call in their own cursory probes into Russia\u2019s ties to the White House. These witnesses included White House aides Stephen Miller and Keith Kellogg, as well as former administration officials like former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and K.T. McFarland, who served under Flynn.\n\nBetween them, these witnesses could provide more insight into the Trump campaign\u2019s interest in pursuing a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as into whether Russians were offering stolen emails from the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee in exchange for such meetings. The witnesses could also shed light on Trump\u2019s personal involvement in Mike Flynn\u2019s reassurances to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, during the presidential transition in December 2016, that the Trump administration would seek to reverse Obama-era sanctions on Russia.\n\nSchiff said he could also call Roman Beniaminov, who worked with Rob Goldstone, the music promoter who first set up the Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 in which Donald Trump Jr. sought to obtain dirt on Hillary Clinton. Beniaminov learned in advance that Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya would be dealing \u201csome negative information\u201d on Clinton.\n\nDemocrats would also call witnesses related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the Trump-affiliated firm gained access to the data of millions of Facebook users. Those witnesses could provide insight into how the Trump campaign exploited Facebook\u2019s personal data to suppress certain kinds of voters in 2016. The legal concern here is two-fold: first, whether Cambridge Analytica employees from the U.K. worked for Trump illegally in the United States; second, whether Trump\u2019s PAC, where some of those employees worked, coordinated improperly with the campaign. Given reports that Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix had discussions with billionaire Trump supporter Rebekah Mercer about optimizing the release of the emails stolen by Russia, Democrats would also inquire whether Cambridge Analytica exploited data stolen by Russians.\n\nPerhaps the most incendiary testimony could relate to how Russians Aleksandr Torshin and Maria Butina, with the assistance of Republican operative Paul Erickson, used the National Rifle Association as a vehicle to draw the Republican Party closer to Russia. While Butina was arrested in July and Erickson is reportedly under active investigation, court documents relating to Butina\u2019s prosecution describe Rockefeller heir George O\u2019Neill Jr.\u2019s active cooperation in Butina\u2019s operation, down to his learning about Putin\u2019s personal approval for the effort to host a series of \u201cfriendship and dialogue dinners\u201d at which Russians could foster pro-Russian policies. \u201c[A]ll that we needed is <<yes>> from Putin\u2019s side. The rest is easier,\u201d Butina wrote O\u2019Neill in March 2016.\n\nIn the March plan, Democrats also said they would compel more information and testimony from witnesses that Republicans had let off easy. For example, the report lays out how both Donald Trump Jr. and Trump\u2019s former campaign chair Corey Lewandowski refused, in past appearances before the Intelligence Committee, to describe communications pertaining to the June 9 meeting in Trump Tower.\n\nThe report also calls for more materials from the president\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen pertaining to a 2016 bid to brand a Trump Tower in Moscow that continued well into the election year. And it argues that Erik Prince, the former head of the private security firm formerly known as Blackwater, must fully explain his meeting in the Seychelles with the head of a Russian investment firm, Kirill Dmitriev. Reporting since Prince testified to the committee in November 2017 suggests Prince lied about the meeting being an effort to set up a backchannel between Trump\u2019s team and Russia.\n\nDemocrats have also promised to subpoena Twitter, WhatsApp, Apple, and the Trump Organization to learn more about communications that might be part of a conspiracy. For example, they\u2019d like to obtain records showing which people, including Trump associates, communicated with Russian military intelligence mouthpiece Guccifer 2.0 or WikiLeaks, the outlets that released the Clinton and DNC emails stolen by Russia. In addition, Democrats would like to learn whether Trump associates communicated using encrypted messaging applications\u2014messages that might have been missed in prior records requests.\n\nSo Democrats have a fairly robust plan for the investigations they\u2019ll conduct if they win a majority in the House. But even that would only scratch the surface.\n\nDemocrats don\u2019t have Mueller\u2019s investigative prowess.\n\nThe steps laid out by Schiff don\u2019t account for what happens if Mueller is fired before finishing his investigation. That\u2019s a problem because, at every step of his probe, Mueller has identified key players in Russia\u2019s 2016 election operation that no one, including members of Congress, had yet discovered.\n\nA few examples: A rural California man, Richard Pinedo, sold Russian internet trolls the identities they used to sow division among voters on Twitter and Facebook during the election\u2014a role only disclosed when Mueller indicted the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll farm based in Saint Petersburg. That same indictment described, but did not name, three Trump campaign officials in Florida who interacted with Russian trolls organizing a \u201cFlorida Goes Trump\u201d rally in August 2016. (Those three people have never been publicly identified, and if they\u2019ve been interviewed by any congressional committee, that fact remains secret.)\n\nMeanwhile, Sam Patten, a Republican lobbyist, started cooperating with federal prosecutors a good three months before it was publicly reported. Patten was the partner of the Russian-Ukrainian consultant and suspected Russian intelligence officer Konstantin Kilimnik, who interacted with Paul Manafort during the Trump campaign.\n\nThe most visible signs of Mueller\u2019s investigation since February pertain to longtime Trump hatchet man Roger Stone, and yet where that aspect of the probe might lead remains a mystery. Trump campaign aide Sam Nunberg, Stone assistant John Kakanis, Stone social media adviser Jason Sullivan, Stone associate Kristin Davis, radio host Randy Credico, and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi\u2014all appeared before Mueller\u2019s grand jury.\n\nLongtime Trump aide Roger Stone is an integral, if mysterious, figure in Mueller\u2019s probe. John Sciulli/Getty Images for Politicon\n\nMueller\u2019s team also interviewed Ted Malloch, an associate of the British anti-immigration firebrand Nigel Farage. They questioned Trump aide Michael Caputo, while Stone aide Andrew Miller is currently fighting a grand jury subpoena in the District of Columbia Circuit Court. By May 25, at a time when just four of his associates had publicly revealed their testimony, Stone said eight of his associates had already been contacted by Mueller\u2019s team. (Another witness against Stone received a subpoena but has never been publicly identified.)\n\nWhile public reports have focused on questions about Stone\u2019s interactions with Guccifer 2.0 or WikiLeaks, some of the Mueller team\u2019s activity may relate to Stone\u2019s dirty election tricks, which were funded by dark money groups. It\u2019s unclear how such fundraising might relate to allegations that Stone cooperated with Russia. So even for the part of the Mueller investigation that has been most public, there are big gaps in the public record\u2014gaps that committees in the House might not be able to close.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just witnesses. Mueller has also obtained a great deal of records and communications that no committee in Congress is known to have obtained. As one example, on March 9, Mueller obtained search warrants for five AT&T phones, having shown probable cause those phones included evidence of a crime. At least one of those phones belonged to Paul Manafort (which is how details of the warrant became public), but the identities of the other people who had their phones searched remain undisclosed.\n\nThen there\u2019s the money angle. Buzzfeed has done great reporting on Suspicious Activity Reports on bank transfers associated with the Russian investigation. It has also raised questions about whether Treasury has cooperated with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the one committee that requested financial records relating to the investigation. But there\u2019s no sign any committee in Congress has examined Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency transfers\u2014financial flows that have figured prominently in Russia\u2019s campaign disruption efforts. If the Mueller investigation is sidelined, congressional investigators might need to access the secret connections Mueller\u2019s team has spent 18 months discovering.\n\nHow would they go about doing that?\n\nDemocrats can use a Watergate playbook.\n\nHouse Democrats might follow the precedent set during Watergate\u2014the last time that a president tried to thwart an investigation into election corruption by firing the Department of Justice officials conducting it.\n\nMueller\u2019s activities thus far have been laid out in plea deals and highly detailed \u201cspeaking\u201d indictments, which provide far more information about the actions involved than strictly necessary for legal purposes. But according to the regulation that governs his appointment, at the end of his investigation Mueller must also provide the attorney general with \u201ca confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the special counsel.\u201d Also upon completion of the investigation, if the attorney general overrules an action Mueller wanted to take, he or she must notify the chair and ranking members of the Judiciary Committee.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what, within the scope of the regulations, would happen to such a report in the scenario laid out here, where Mueller got fired on some trumped-up claim of improper action. The only thing that would necessarily get shared with Congress is the report on why the attorney general had overruled Mueller, which wouldn\u2019t necessarily include details of what else Mueller had discovered. Indeed, Neal Katyal, the former Obama administration lawyer who wrote the special counsel regulation under which Mueller operates, recently advised Rosenstein to provide a report to Congress before a meeting with Trump at which he might have been fired.\n\nBut Rosenstein might not permit such reports under department regulations. Rosenstein has refused to share information on the investigation in the past, citing the Department of Justice policy on not confirming names of those being investigated unless they are charged. And thus far, even Republicans attempting to undermine the investigation have not sought investigative materials from Mueller, instead focusing on the FBI investigation up to the time when Mueller was hired on May 17, 2017. That\u2019s partly because under rule 6(e) of grand jury proceedings, information can only be shared for other legal proceedings (such as a state trial or military commission).\n\nYet a Watergate precedent suggests the House could obtain the report if Mueller were fired.\n\nA Watergate precedent may be the key to protecting the Mueller investigation. Pierre Manevy/Express/Getty Images\n\nSome Freedom of Information Act requests have recently focused attention on\u2014and may lead to the public release of\u2014a report similar to the one Mueller is mandated to complete. It was the report done by Watergate prosecutor Leon Jaworski, referred to as the \u201cRoad Map.\u201d The Road Map consists of a summary and 53 pages of evidentiary descriptions, each citing the underlying grand jury source for that evidentiary description. In 1974, Jaworski used it to transmit information discovered during his grand jury investigation to the House Judiciary Committee\u2014which then used the report to kickstart its impeachment investigation.\n\nBefore Jaworski shared the Road Map, however, he obtained authorization from then-Chief Judge John Sirica of the D.C. Circuit Court. In Sirica\u2019s opinion authorizing the transfer, he deemed the report to be material to House Judiciary Committee duties. He further laid out how such a report should be written to avoid separation of powers issues. The report as compiled by Jaworski offered \u201cno accusatory conclusions\u201d nor \u201csubstitute[s] for indictments where indictments might properly issue.\u201d It didn\u2019t tell Congress what to do with the information. Rather it was \u201ca simple and straightforward compilation of information gathered by the Grand Jury, and no more.\u201d Per Sirica, that rendered the report constitutionally appropriate to share with another branch of government.\n\nIf Mueller\u2014whose team includes former Watergate prosecutor James Quarles\u2014were fired and he leaves any report behind that fits the standards laid out here, this Watergate precedent should ensure it could be legally shared with the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nCan Trump do anything to stop them?\n\nThe D.C. Circuit Court recently heard a case, McKeevy v. Sessions, on whether judges can release historic grand jury materials. Chief Judge Beryl Howell, who is presiding over the Road Map FOIAs as well as the Mueller grand jury, has stayed the Road Map FOIA to await its results. But McKeevy is a request for public release of grand jury materials, rather than disclosure to a government body with the constitutional duty to conduct its own investigations. As such, it probably wouldn\u2019t affect the Watergate precedent.\n\nSo if Trump challenges the conveyance of Mueller\u2019s report to the House Judiciary Committee, he would be making an argument not even Richard Nixon made. It is also an argument that the U.S. v. Nixon precedent\u2014which held that due process limits the president\u2019s claims of privilege\u2014likely would not support.\n\nStill, Trump will have one more way to stall, though probably not kill, House efforts to pick up where a fired Mueller left off. Under current House rules, committee chairs have the authority and the majority votes to issue subpoenas; if Democrats win a majority, they could even set new rules in the new Congress permitting committee chairs to issue subpoenas by themselves. But because the Department of Justice traditionally enforces subpoenas, congressional committees led by the opposition party have traditionally struggled to enforce subpoenas they do issue, especially for White House officials. That would be doubly true if Trump replaced Sessions with someone even more interested in obstructing real accountability for the president.\n\nEven under Republican control of Congress, Trump officials have avoided or sharply limited their testimony by suggesting executive privilege might cover their testimony\u2014without actually making Trump invoke it. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and then-Director of National Security Agency Mike Rogers dodged testimony in this fashion, before ultimately testifying in a session closed to the public. More egregiously, former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks and Lewandowski refused to answer some of the questions posed by the House Intelligence Committee, notably declining to share information on the presidential transition.\n\nGiven two recent precedents\u2014forcing the testimony of George Bush\u2019s White House Counsel Harriet Miers (and consigliere Karl Rove) in the investigation into the firing of U.S. Attorneys and the cooperation of Barack Obama\u2019s Attorney General Eric Holder in the investigation into the Fast and Furious scandal\u2014a Democratic House will likely be able to compel cooperation from witnesses, even if it might take a while.\n\nAt a fundraiser in July, Rep. Devin Nunes, the Republican who thwarted all of Schiff\u2019s investigative ambition on the House Intelligence Committee, explained that unless the Russian investigation were stopped, then the only way to thwart it would be for Republicans to retain the majority in the House. \u201cWe have to keep the majority,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we do not keep the majority, all of this goes away.\u201d\n\nIt might take time and a whole lot of litigation for the Mueller investigation to come to light. But Nunes may well prove to be right."

    "text": "Five years ago, on September 18, 2013, Golden Dawn member Giorgos Roupakias stabbed and killed Pavlos Fyssas, a 34-year-old anti-fascist rapper, outside a Piraeus caf\u00e9 in full view of police officers. Outraged, Tombatzoglou became the Fyssas family\u2019s civil suit lawyer in the broader trial the rapper\u2019s slaying helped trigger.\n\nKicked off on April 20, 2015, the trial was predicted to span 18 months. It includes several civil suits and criminal charges against 69 Golden Dawn members, including the party\u2019s core leadership, accused of operating a criminal organization, murder, racist violence, weapons possession, and money laundering, among other allegations. But with the trial dragging on and a verdict distant, Greek far-right groups, among them Golden Dawn, are reorganizing, carrying out further violence against refugees, migrants, political opponents\u2014and individuals linked to the trial.\n\nIn early October, Tombatzoglou joined a dozen civil action lawyers calling for the trial to be sped up. The petition to newly-minted Justice Minister Michalis Kalogirou requested daily hearings in central Athens and asked that judges be freed up from other duties to focus on the case.\n\nTo date, the court has held more than 253 hearings, 250 prosecution witnesses took the stand, and the opposing legal teams entered into evidence tens of thousands of documents. Yet, with at least 230 defense witnesses waiting to testify and only eight to ten hearings taking place each month, it could now stretch into 2020.\n\n\u201cThe slower the trial moves, the better it is for Golden Dawn to gain time and organize politically,\u201d said Thanasis Kampagiannis, another civil suit lawyer in the trial. He believes the defense team is \u201cstalling\u201d with lengthy hearings examining irrelevant documents. \u201cAnd the slower the process, the more they sense that they have impunity.\u201d\n\nThe evening of the attack on Favela, Golden Dawn chief Nikolaos Michaloliakos issued statement denying his party\u2019s involvement\u2014much as he did on November 1, 2017, dismissing claims that his supporters attacked Evgenia Kouniaki, another civil suit lawyer, outside an Athens courthouse in broad daylight. The denials in both cases were far-fetched: Kouniaki\u2019s attackers had been passing out Golden Dawn fliers only moments before they swarmed her, one of them slugging her in the face until her nose gushed blood.\n\nNearly four decades ago, in 1980, Michaloliakos, a 25-year-old with an impressive resume of political violence and criminal charges, founded the national socialist journal Golden Dawn. The journal\u2019s publications have included brazen praise for German Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and his deputy Rudolf Hess, glowing profiles of American white supremacist outfits, and skepticism of the systematic extermination of Jews during the Holocaust.\n\nGolden Dawn did not register as a political party until 1993. The newly-founded party was small in numbers but militant. Golden Dawn\u2019s supporters subjected political opponents to a series of assaults that culminated in 1998 with a brutal attack on left-wing student unionists. That incident left 24-year-old Dimitris Kousouris in a coma for more than a month.\n\nThe unruly band of neo-Nazis remained largely confined to the margins of political life until its swift rise to national prominence during a pair of elections in 2012. As has been the case with far-right and neo-fascist outfits in several European countries in recent years, Golden Dawn coasted on a flood of anger from the country\u2019s financial crisis and migration, first entering the parliament the following year. By then the party\u2019s highly organized violence against migrants and leftists had already gripped Greece for years, yet the attacks accelerated after the electoral success. Party jackboots toppled migrant-operated stalls in open-air markets, military-like gangs mobbed leftists and anarchists caught walking alone, and flag-waving motorcades patrolled neighborhoods home to Asian and African immigrants.\n\nThe arrests of dozens of Golden Dawn members in the wake of Fyssas\u2019s murder led to sharp slump in violence. With its leaders behind bars for 18 months of pre-trial detention, its members accused in the court, and its supporters facing anti-fascist pushback every time they took to the streets, Golden Dawn was isolated and weakened. Many Greeks hoped that the wave of pogroms had finally come to an end.\n\nBut despite most Greeks supporting the crackdown on the party, Golden Dawn repeated its electoral success in January 2015, gaining more than six percent of the vote and becoming the third largest party in the Hellenic Parliament. With Golden Dawn proving resilient and its fifteen lawmakers still using the parliament as a platform to amplify its ultra-nationalist message, the return of vigilante violence was imminent. Last year, hate crimes more than doubled, with incidents targeting people for their race, ethnicity, or national origin growing from 48 to 133, when compared to 2016.\n\nGolden Dawn members protest the imprisonment of their members of parliament in 2013. Louisa Gouliamaki/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThroughout 2018, far-right attacks\u2014not all of them committed by Golden Dawn\u2014have persisted. During several rallies against the Greek-Macedonian name agreement, masked men beat journalists, flashed pistols, set anarchist squats ablaze, and desecrated Jewish memorials. In the otherwise sleepy agricultural communities neighboring Athens, young Greeks beat, stabbed, and bludgeoned Pakistani migrant workers. And on Greek islands, far-right protesters fired flares and lobbed bottles and stones at asylum seekers protesting poor living conditions in the ramshackle refugee camps.\n\nWhen Naim Elghandour, the 64-year-old Egyptian-born president of the Muslim Association of Greece, received a grim anonymous phone call at home on January 18, the caller identified himself as member of Crypteia, a shadowy neo-Nazi group that garnered international media attention after attacking an Afghan family\u2019s home in November 2017. \u201cWe are the group that kills, burns, hits, and tortures immigrants, mainly Muslims,\u201d said the voice on the other end of the line.\n\nBecause he was at the time preparing to deliver an eight-hour testimony about Golden Dawn\u2019s attacks on Greece-based Egyptian fishermen in the party\u2019s trial, Elghandour found the timing suspicious. The following morning, he learned that at least three other civil society groups linked to the Golden Dawn trial had received the similar phone calls. \u201cThe police need to act because they know very well who these people are,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey are an enemy of everyone, of humanity.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in early March, Greek counter-terrorism police arrested several members of Combat 18 Hellas, a national socialist group that had executed a three-year string of some 30 attacks on left-wing squats and Jewish cemeteries. During subsequent searches of the suspects\u2019 homes, investigators discovered ammonium nitrate, Molotov cocktails, knives, shotguns, fascist literature, and small quantities of narcotics; they learned also that the Combat 18 Hellas included former Golden Dawn members.\n\nTombatzoglou has arrived at a bleak conclusion in recent months: More attacks are inevitable, including those meant to intimidate lawyers and witnesses in the trial. And the more elusive a guilty verdict seems, the more far-right attackers will operate with apparent impunity. The law and its ever-more-hypothetical ability to punish, at this point, have failed to check Golden Dawn activities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in their nature,\u201d she said of the Golden Dawn party. \u201cThey cannot exist without violence. There is no point in being a member of this party without the violence.\u201d"

    "text": "Perhaps, then, one day in a primordial pond filled with organic molecules, an RNA molecule came together with the capacity to replicate itself. That would be one of the most consequential half-seconds in the history of the earth (and potentially, the universe): the moment life began. Evolution would take things from there, leading from that single molecular strand to every creature on earth, all of which share the genetic code.\n\nGould embraces this theory, writing that \u201can ancient RNA world would make sense \u2026 it might have served to jumpstart life.\u201d Yet, as others have argued, the spontaneous emergence of such a highly complex RNA molecule would also have been profoundly improbable. The late Robert Shapiro, professor of chemistry at New York University and author of Origins: A Skeptic\u2019s Guide to the Creation of Life on Earth, has put this eloquently: \u201cThe chances for the spontaneous assembly of a[n RNA] replicator,\u201d he wrote in a 2007 article in Scientific American, \u201ccan be compared to those of the gorilla composing, in English, a coherent recipe for the preparation of chili con carne.\u201d The unlikeliness of spontaneous RNA replication, then, seems to contradict Gould\u2019s idea that the universe was programmed to produce life. It brings us back to the possibility that yes, life on earth was simply a bizarre, freak occurrence.\n\nAnd yet\u2014and here\u2019s where things get interesting\u2014Shapiro actually agreed with Gould\u2019s fundamental thesis. He adhered, however, to an alternative to RNA-world referred to as \u201cmetabolism first,\u201d which he thought consistent with this thesis. In this framework, molecules\u2014perhaps fats\u2014aggregated and \u201cself-organized,\u201d as they are apt to do under the laws of nature, forming compartments within which metabolic circuits began to run, well before complex genetic molecules come into being. These early forms of life may not have resembled life at all, but perhaps something intermediate between the living and the non-living. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing freaky about life,\u201d Shapiro said in a 2008 talk. \u201cIt\u2019s a normal consequence of the laws of the universe.\u201d Gould says nearly the same thing\u2014\u201clife really is written into the behavior of molecules.\u201d\n\nWhichever specific origin of life theory we turn to, the thesis that life is somehow programmed into the universe feels uncomfortable but also attractive. Uncomfortable, because it seems to carry a whiff of creationism: Is this just wishful thinking after all, intelligent design gussied up for the scientifically-minded? It is attractive, however, for the same reason. It means that life is the inevitable, invariant consequence of the laws of physics at work, giving life about as much meaning in the universe as an atheist could in good conscience ask for.\n\nWhat we want to be true is, of course, irrelevant. The fascinating thing, however, is that Gould\u2019s thesis may very well prove true. If it turns out that life\u2014even the most rudimentary microbial life\u2014is common to the universe, the case, as Gould suggests, is settled. Given the distances humans would have to travel to verify this, it is not something that can easily be proved. But even if there is or ever has been any sort of simple life on Mars\u2014and this is something that could be ascertained in our lifetime\u2014then Shapiro and Gould, although they embrace different theories of the origins of life, are essentially correct.\n\nAfter all, if life emerged independently on two planets in a single solar system, it is nothing unusual. Indeed, that finding alone would be powerful evidence that life has a tendency to emerge, and is presumably widespread throughout the universe. The origins of life would indeed be found in the laws of nature.\n\nBut we can\u2019t make too much of that either. For though any such finding would greatly raise life\u2019s stature in the universe, it would do nothing to elevate that of humanity. Even if we prove that life is a property of physics, we humans would still be creatures of chance\u2014and natural selection. Monod would thus be half-wrong and half-right: the universe would indeed have been pregnant with life, but not with humanity."

    "text": "The general public may view wilderness areas like recreational facilities. But scientists see them more like libraries. They contain a wealth of information about the natural world\u2014why it has thrived for so long, how it adapts and evolves under the pressure of evolution, and what truly makes it die. They are \u201cimportant reservoirs of genetic information, and act as reference areas for efforts to re-wild degraded land and seascapes,\u201d the scientists wrote. The information contained in wild places allows researchers to predict what will happen as climate change worsens.\n\nSpeaking of climate change, untouched places also happen to be humanity\u2019s biggest shield against the phenomenon. Tropical and boreal forests are carbon sinks: They absorb up to 40 percent of the carbon dioxide we emit into the atmosphere, thereby preventing it from causing rapid warming of the planet. Human development within these forests not only limits their ability to provide this critical function; it creates more carbon emissions by replacing the trees with high-emitting farming and logging operations.\n\nWild seagrass meadows provide a similar carbon-absorbing function in the ocean\u2014that is, until they\u2019re affected by pollution. When that happens, they \u201cswitch from being carbon sinks to major carbon sources,\u201d the scientists wrote. Wild places can protect communities from extreme weather, too. \u201cSimulations of tsunamis, for instance, indicate that healthy coral reefs provide coastlines with at least twice as much protection as highly degraded ones.\u201d\n\nWild places are also critical habitats for wildlife, which is declining at a stunning rate. A report released Monday by the advocacy group World Wildlife Fund found that mammal, bird, fish, reptile and amphibian populations have declined at a 60 percent rate on average since 1970, a phenomenon due in part to habitat loss. This isn\u2019t just bad for the animals, either. \u201cThere is a connection between loss of the natural environment and human health,\u201d WWF\u2019s chief executive Carter Roberts told the Washington Post. \u201cWhere does our food come from? Where does our water come?\u201d\n\nThe complete degradation and disappearance of wilderness on the planet is a real possibility, but not inevitable. Some of the world\u2019s wealthiest citizens are stepping up to save what\u2019s left. Yvon Chouinard, the billionaire founder of outdoor company Patagonia, has used his company to donate $89 million toward conservation efforts, as well as advocate against the Trump administration\u2019s anti-wilderness efforts. He also founded 1% For the Planet, an effort to increase environmental philanthropy. And on Thursday, Swiss philanthropist Hansj\u00f6rg Wyss, who lives in Wyoming, announced in a New York Times op-ed that he\u2019s donating \u201c$1 billion over the next decade to help accelerate land and ocean conservation efforts around the world, with the goal of protecting 30 percent of the planet\u2019s surface by 2030.\u201d"

    "text": "It\u2019s a sentiment both familiar\u2014\u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d\u2014and frustrating for anyone hoping their leaders would take action to prevent such attacks, rather than issuing routine platitudes. But \u201cforgetting the nightmare\u201d (or, ideally, pretending it never happened) is one of the few coping mechanisms available to those living in an authoritarian system, especially one so brittle and restrictive it won\u2019t acknowledge fault nor even allow relatives to mourn in public.\n\nThe instinct to suppress grievances, from street level\u2014where stone-faced security guards seize wreaths and tributes, and forcefully move along mourners\u2014to social media, in which reports on the hundreds of violent outbursts that happen daily are heavily monitored for political commentary, has led to an almost-willful blindness among many Chinese, particularly a middle class vested in the status quo, about the thuggishness that perpetuates it. One particularly grim video, posted in June, shows a man in the city of Datong diligently hacking away at a middle-aged woman in broad daylight, until her scalp comes away on his cleaver blade. The victim, it emerged, was a \u201clocal tyrant\u201d (tuhao) who had ordered goons to beat her neighbor for complaining about a leaky water pipe; bribed police to ignore his injuries, including a fractured eye socket and lost testicle; then insulted him, prompting the lethal backlash. With this information, a neighborhood atrocity became an act of vengeance that many deemed worthy of sympathy or approval.\n\nThe story was not widely reported, probably because the combination of corruption, callousness, and everyday brutality was far too close to the bone: The spendthrift offspring of rich businessmen and officials are known as tuhao, a word first coined to describe the kind of petty bully who terrorized their provincial fiefdoms before the Communists came and murdered them en masse. Censorship doesn\u2019t always prevent information about incidents from leaking completely, but it does dilute and distill it, marginalizing the outrage away from mainstream opinion. The result is that, while those who diligently read the news may deplore the yawning chasm of moral vacuity and materialism they see, the general public is too stressed to care, too anaesthetized by the Party\u2019s unstinting calls for \u201cpositive energy\u201d to reckon with reality until it\u2019s too late.\n\nSchool slayings do still shock and appall, if briefly, but few will likely remember that, only a month ago, a 54-year-old man drove his SUV into a crowd in Hunan, got out and started stabbing victims indiscriminately (nine dead; 46 injured), or that, in April, a disgruntled ex-student killed five children and injured 12 in another school stabbing in Shaanxi, and, in June, another man killed two primary school pupils in Shanghai with a kitchen knife. These are certainly not incidents the government wants anyone considering, because, as Zhang Jing, a witness to the Chongqing incident, told CNN, much of everyday life is already \u201cterrifying\u201d for many: \u201cThe vaccines are faulty, the food is faulty... and right now even the security is problematic.\u201d\n\nSecurity was supposed to have been beefed-up nationwide in response to an extraordinary wave of school attacks that took place in 2010, beginning with the murder of eight children in Nanping. The attacker was executed within a month but, just hours after the sentence was carried out, another knifeman wounded 16 students. A day later, an unemployed man stabbed 28 schoolchildren. Four more attacks occurred over the following months, leaving 27 dead and 80 injured, and seemingly confirming fears that media reports would spur a wave of copycats. In the aftermath, the Minister of Education promised to deploy more security to protect schoolyards, with one guard guaranteed per school by 2013 (a ludicrous proposal, given the poverty and lack of resources that many schools suffer; neighbors of the Chongqing kindergarten said the school didn\u2019t even have a playground and used a local park for exercises, a decision that proved a ghastly mistake)."

    "text": "The stakes for gang outreach are rising ahead of El Salvador\u2019s 2019 presidential election, as the gangs face a renewed offensive from the combined forces of San Salvador\u2019s security state and President Trump, who has prioritized the war on gangs at the expense of other aid. Both the left-leaning Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front, FMLN, and the opposition party, the conservative Nationalist Republican Alliance, ARENA, have again endorsed gang crackdown as their security strategy, a policy largely indistinguishable and unchanged through two decades of elections.\n\nIn 2003, the ARENA government launched mano dura, an \u201ciron-fist\u201d approach imitating the American anti-gang strategy. After FMLN won the presidency for the first time in 2009, even the party\u2019s guerillas-turned-politicians continued the militarized response. In overcrowded prisons, the gangs established control and consolidated power. Homicides continued to rise.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for the two main parties is which can present itself as the tougher on crime,\u201d says Jose Miguel Cruz, director of research at Florida International University\u2019s Latin American and Caribbean Center. \u201cThat is their race to the bottom.\u201d\n\nYet as the February presidential election looms, both FMLN and ARENA have largely evaded the gang issue, perhaps responding to voters\u2019 apparent disillusionment with corruption and payoffs to the very criminal groups they rail against. In March legislative and municipal elections, 70 percent of voters defaced their ballots or stayed home rather than vote for either FMLN or ARENA, indicating that for the first time in decades, they\u2019re looking for a third way. Former San Salvador Mayor Nayib Bukele, an anti-establishment, millionaire millennial and 2019 front-runner, backed the March boycott, although voters may not have needed the encouragement: Murders are on pace to average ten per day in 2018, nearly 80 percent of Salvadorans believe state security policies are ineffective, nearly 65 percent say police are violating human rights, and confidence in elections is at its lowest point in decades.\n\nThe Salvadoran political establishment\u2019s hardline approach to gangs is supported by the U.S. government, which opposed gang negotiations even under President Obama, but has become a still stronger force against compromise under the Trump administration. In the past two years, the U.S. has deported thousands of Salvadorans providing both new recruits and new targets for the gangs. The Trump administration has also threatened steep cuts in funding to El Salvador and other countries unless they do more to go after purported gang members, and threatened to choke off aid altogether unless they stop certain migrants. Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, served as a \u201cget-tough\u201d security consultant to the Salvadoran government in 2015, and his chief of staff, John Kelly, formerly head of U.S. Southern Command, has long advocated for more support to \u201cprofessionalize\u201d Central American security forces, despite evidence of human rights violations.\n\nRoberto is prepares himself before receiving a diploma certifying his participation in the Eber Ezer Church and his commitment to change. Tattoos on the face and body can restrict former gang members\u2019 options for a new life.\n\nAll of this could end up empowering both El Salvador\u2019s Evangelical movement and its criminal groups, which cater to poor and oppressed Salvadorans, including those fleeing to, and deported from, the United States. But whether the churches can use their increasing power to stabilize the country is far from clear. As Taber\u2019s own history shows, not every attempt to spur negotiation has produced progress toward peace.\n\nAs civil war erupted in El Salvador in the 1980s, Toby Jr. was working at a Miami McDonald\u2019s and racing motorcycles. Now forty-nine with a salt-and-pepper goatee, he still speaks English like a Miami teen, favoring \u201clike\u201d and \u201cCan you imagine?\u201d\n\nHis father was ordained in 1975 at Tennessee Temple University, then brought his family back to El Salvador to found his own congregation. But at 17, a rebellious Toby Jr. left for Florida to join his U.S.-citizen sister and mother.\n\nBy the time peace accords were signed and the prodigal son returned, Taber\u2019s empire extended to a Bible academy, an orphanage, a rehab center, soup kitchens, and deportee services. With tattoos, piercings, boots and cargo pants, Toby Jr. publicly butted heads with his more conservative father, making no secret of his impatience for him to step aside and turn Taber\u2019s empire over to a younger, more forward-thinking leader. When he died, the legislature held a moment of silence, and Toby Jr. inherited more than 30 ministries and 500 pastors.\n\nI asked Toby Jr. how he felt about Trump\u2019s attitude toward El Salvador and Latino immigrants. (Trump began his presidency talking about \u201cbad hombres,\u201d and \u201ccriminals,\u201d and later moved on to talk of \u201cshithole countries\u201d and \u201canimals.\u201d)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always blaming Mr. Trump,\u201d Toby Jr. said. \u201cBut I always tell them, \u2018The God the Americans have is the same God the Salvadorans have. Now what is the difference? You\u2019re making the wrong choices.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nYears before his father\u2019s death, Toby Jr. began cultivating his own following\u2014and invited controversy for giving gang leaders a platform at Taber.\n\nIn 2012, FMLN President Mauricio Funes privately gave his defense minister approval to pursue a truce with the gangs. Ra\u00fal Mijango, a former-guerilla congressman, and Fabio Colindres, a right-leaning Catholic bishop, became the primary negotiators. Under the deal, MS-13 and two Barrio 18 factions would lower homicides, and the government would transfer their leaders from maximum-security to lower-level prisons where they could enforce the truce.\n\nEnter Toby Jr. A year into talks, as Toby Sr. was recovering from a stroke, his rising celebrity pastor son stunned Salvadorans by hosting incarcerated leaders from MS-13 and Barrio 18 before 7,000 congregants at Taber\u2019s main church, as well as a national-TV audience. Under high security but without handcuffs, they sat next to each other in slacks and shiny shoes.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d kill each other in a heartbeat! And I sat them down in church with a Bible,\u201d Toby Jr. recounted.\n\nIn the Taber interview with Toby Jr., the gang bosses told voters to boycott candidates who opposed negotiation with the gangs. Afterward, they returned to jail. Today, Toby Jr. insists that cabinet officials asked him to invite the pair. If they did, they clearly didn\u2019t anticipate the outrage from a public long terrorized by gangs. After the event, the chief of prisons was promptly dismissed, and as a backlash began in the polls, presidential hopefuls quickly disavowed any deal with such criminals.\n\n\n\n\u201cGuess who got stuck with all the scandal? Me,\u201d Toby Jr. said, insisting of the gang leaders, \u201cI didn\u2019t wash their feet, I didn\u2019t give them Communion, I didn\u2019t kiss them. They were just using us.\u201d\n\nAs the truce\u2019s prison transfers began, President Funes denied any quid-pro-quo, while the Catholic hierarchy declared its opposition, and the U.S. Treasury, which designated MS-13 a transnational criminal organization, added MS-13 leaders to its \u201ckingpin\u201d list. Subsequent reports and court testimony revealed that the incarcerated truce-participating gang leaders received everything from fried chicken and flat screen TVs to exotic dancers. Then evidence emerged that both FMLN and ARENA pledged millions of dollars to gang higher-ups to secure votes for the 2014 presidential election.\n\nStill, the truce yielded a miracle: The homicide rate dropped by half. In 2015, when the truce collapsed, homicides spiked to a record 103 per 100,000 Salvadorans.\n\nAfter FMLN barely held on to executive office amid the continued furor over the truce, newly-elected President Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n sought to distance himself from any association with negotiation, declaring a state of emergency in the prisons, deploying the military, and inviting extrajudicial killings of suspected gang members. The Supreme Court designated gangs and any collaborators as terrorists, and prosecutors charged dozens involved with the truce with crimes, including former President Funes.\n\nAhead of the 2019 contest, homicides have continued to drop from their 2015 high, but they remain among the highest in the world, and public confidence has tanked. FMLN is touting progress\u2014but so are the gangs. MS-13 and the two main factions of Barrio 18 responded to S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n\u2019s fervent crackdown by announcing a truce between themselves, independent of the state. The government can\u2019t eliminate the gangs, a bandana-masked spokesman said, because they have the power \u201cto destroy the country\u2019s political establishment.\u201d\n\nIn reality, even those claiming to offer a new path\u2014the \u201canti-establishment\u201d Bukele, for example\u2014realize the necessity of bargaining with the gangs. Despite Bukele\u2019s criticism of FMLN and ARENA for corrupt ties to criminal groups, his administration also made pacts with the gangs to secure projects while he was mayor, investigative site El Faro reported in June.\n\nThis is the legacy of the truce: Whatever Trump\u2019s threats, the Salvadoran public, politicians, pastors and pandilleros all know that the road to the country\u2019s salvation runs through gang turf."

Ibb, in the southwestern corner of the country, is the wettest place in the entire Arabian Peninsula. It\u2019s also a rare source of viable land for growing food and storing water in an otherwise dry, dusty country\u2014one now facing a catastrophic, war-fueled famine.\n\nBut Ibb isn\u2019t the same place it used to be, said Elayah, now a senior scientist at the Netherlands-based Centre for International Development Issues. \u201cIt was very green. Now it\u2019s almost all stone,\u201d he told me on Friday. Farmland has been replaced by buildings\u2014many of which now hold starving Yemenis who have fled the civil war in the north. More than a quarter of Yemen\u2019s two million internally displaced persons, or IDPs, have found refuge in Ibb, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nIbb may be Yemen\u2019s most fertile ground, but its IDPs are still starving, WHO reports. This probably would have been the case even without a civil war. Yemen has never had enough arable land (less than 3 percent) to support its population (28 million people). Its population is starving today not because food can\u2019t grow there, but because of a long-standing economic crisis exacerbated by the three-year war.\n\n\u201cBoth sides are using food as a weapon of war, but the crisis is caused primarily by a brutal air, land and sea blockade imposed by a Saudi Arabia-led coalition,\u201d according to CNN, which added that the blockade \u201chas cut the amount of desperately needed food, medicine and fuel getting into the country by more than half, according to aid groups.\u201d"

    "text": "The change has not come easily. Gentrification, particularly in hip districts like Kreuzberg and neighboring Neuk\u00f6lln, has bumped living costs and displaced longterm residents. Berlin, 85 percent of whose 3.5 million residents rent, prevents drastic rent increases on existing tenants. But startups, around three quarters of which fail, come and go quickly, meaning landlords can hike prices again and again. Google, whose privacy infringements and what many perceive as tax avoidance have earned the ire of European Union lawmakers, has become a byword among Europeans for Silicon Valley greed\u2014particularly for Kreuzberg\u2019s electorate, over 75 percent of whom voted for far-left candidates at the most recent poll.\n\n\u201cThere are some who believe in growth without regard, and suffer from startupitis,\u201d says Theo Ioannidis, a councillor for The Greens, Kreuzberg\u2019s most powerful political party. \u201cThey find it exciting that tech giants like Google or the Google Campus [settle] in Berlin.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut many worry that Kreuzberg thereby becomes even more expensive,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s also about the fact that Kreuzberg stands for subculture and alternative lifestyles. And they are more and more threatened by the colonization of huge, multinational companies that like to use this image.\u201d\n\nSoon after Google\u2019s announcement in 2016, protests popped up. Groups published pamphlets and flyers. Google stayed silent. In September this year, a small group of activists tried to occupy the Umspannwerk before police ejected them. Then, on October 24, Google announced it would continue to hold the building\u2019s lease, but hand over operations to Betterplace and Karuna, two social nonprofits.\n\nThe majority of locals hailed a victory for grassroots protest. \u201cI believe that Google was really bewildered by the resistance,\u201d says Stefan Klein, a GloReiche member. \u201cFrom the start they tried to dismiss it as the ideologically-based struggle of a few activists. Yet during the resistance they learned that a broad section of the neighborhood did not agree with the settlement. No wonder they ended up looking for a face-saving solution, in which they wanted their retreat from the Google Campus in Kreuzberg project to look like a social good deed,\u201d Klein adds."

    "text": "Bucklew suffers from a gruesome condition known as cavernous hemangioma, which creates malformations in some of the body\u2019s blood vessels. Over time, those malformations swell and fill with blood until they form benign tumors. The rare condition can manifest anywhere on the body. Bucklew\u2019s case is even more unusual because it primarily affects his mouth and throat. His uvula is covered in blood-filled tumors that make it harder to eat, breathe, and sleep. There is no cure for the condition, and it will progressively worsen for as long as he lives.\n\nMissouri plans to execute him using the sedative pentobarbital. Bucklew contends that his medical condition raises the likelihood that the lethal injection will go awry. In his brief for the court, his lawyers warned that \u201cthe violence of his choking as he slips into unconsciousness will likely cause his tumors to rupture and lead him to aspirate his own blood.\u201d To prevent this, Bucklew asks to be put to death by lethal gas, specifically by asphyxiating him with nitrogen.\n\nState officials oppose Bucklew\u2019s request on both substantive and procedural grounds. Neither Missouri nor any other state has performed a nitrogen asphyxiation, the state argues, so it does not count as a \u201cknown and available\u201d procedure under the Supreme Court\u2019s precedents. Bucklew argues that all he has to do under those precedents is demonstrate that alternative methods exist. \u201cHow a state implements those other options ... are ultimately up to the state,\u201d he told the court. \u201cAn inmate need not specify every last step the state should take along the path to killing him.\u201d\n\nSince the 2008 case Baze v. Rees, the court has favored a state\u2019s desire to perform executions over concerns that its methods may be cruel and unusual. \u201cWe begin with the principle ... that capital punishment is constitutional,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the plurality. \u201cIt necessarily follows that there must be a means of carrying it out.\u201d That logic isn\u2019t airtight, to say the least. But it\u2019s the law of the land. The court\u2019s conservative justices took it even further in Glossip v. Gross in 2015. In a 5-4 decision, they gave Oklahoma the green light after the state botched two executions, and set a high legal threshold for future challenges to execution methods.\n\nOn Tuesday, court-watchers noted a potential change in tone from Roberts, and tough questioning of Missouri\u2019s lawyer by Kavanaugh. \u201cChief Justice John Roberts asked serious, carefully considered questions about particular execution procedures, the court\u2019s precedents, and the ramifications of those precedents,\u201d Chris Geidner, BuzzFeed News\u2019 legal editor, reported on Twitter."

    "text": "Yet I am ultimately glad I stuck with the show, as season two sets off in a new direction, following two captivating women, both lawyers, who wear their own commitments and belief systems with a refreshing openness. I don\u2019t think there would have been a second season if the documentarians had not found these women. Avery and Dassey barely appear in the new season; they are floating voices from prison telephones. The show reorients itself and nearly switches genre: It is no longer a Whodunit but a long-form character study, a dual portrait of two legal crusaders, and an examination of the appeals process. If the first season was a bonanza for Netflix, the second season feels as if it belongs on PBS.\n\nIf the first season was a bonanza for Netflix, the second season feels as if it belongs on PBS.\n\nThe two women at the heart of the new season are both lawyers trying to exonerate a member of Avery family, but that is where the similarities end. Steven Avery\u2019s attorney Kathleen Zellner is what some might call a \u201ccelebrity\u201d lawyer. She focuses on one thing only, which is getting innocent people out of jail. She is good at it. She has done it over 17 times. She seems like a character out of a John Grisham or Gillian Flynn novel (like Gone Girl\u2019s Tanner Bolt), but she is very real, swanning around Wisconsin in designer suits with crimson lipstick and a sleek blowout.\n\nZellner has a knack for courting the media. When she files her appeals paperwork at the county courthouse, she makes sure to hold a press conference. She is good at throwing out snappy one-liners (\u201cIf you are guilty,\u201d she says bluntly, \u201cI will do a way better job of finding out you are guilty than any prosecutor could.\u201d). But she also has a bloodhound\u2019s nose for unasked questions and breadcrumb trails; she does over a dozen new forensic tests and experiments around the Avery property, claiming that the original defense team put in little legwork the first time round. Zellner\u2019s tactics may be flashy\u2014she tweets openly about the case, and still does\u2014but they come from a place of distrust for institutions, an instinct that has guided her work unknotting so many false convictions. She believes the system is broken and twisted on a grand scale, and so she needs to be larger than life to take it on.\n\n\n\nBrendan Dassey\u2019s lawyers take a different path. Laura Nirider and Steve Drizin work for Northwestern University and The Center on Wrongful Convictions of Youth, a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping people who were incarcerated as minors due to forced confessions and other manipulative interventions. Nirider, who gets the most screen time of the team, is less bombastic than Zellner, and perhaps more idealistic. She wears conservative cardigans and sensible clogs (a contrast with Zellner\u2019s velvet blazers and statement jewelry) and spends late nights preparing her cases in her small, cluttered office under buzzing fluorescent lights. While Zellner has yet to have the chance to bring her new case to court, Nirider has been in court defending Dassey several times over the years, as his case moved through a lengthy appeals process.\n\nZellner believes the system is broken and twisted on a grand scale, and so she needs to be larger than life to take it on.\n\nIf Zellner\u2019s story is one of bluster and theatrics, Nirider\u2019s is a slow churn, marking the years that go into trying to extricate someone from the prison system. Dassey\u2019s case made it all the way to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, where at first a panel of three judges upheld the decision of a federal judge, agreeing that Dassey\u2019s confession had been coerced. But after the Wisconsin authorities appealed and asked for a full en banc review (meaning all nine judges of the Seventh Circuit weighed in), Dassey\u2019s conviction remained, and the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear his case. He has now exhausted all options for appeal and continues to serve time. Throughout this arduous process, Nirider looks worn down, and yet she never loses her pluck. She knows the system is a mess and yet wakes up every morning determined to try to navigate it as best she can."

    "text": "We begin in Sri Lanka, amidst the government\u2019s war against the Tamil Tigers. Colvin strolls through a rural, dirt-floor compound, debating history with a nameless source. Their dialogue sets the tone for the rest of the script to come: It\u2019s a little corny and simplistic, but the point certainly gets across. \u201cThere are people dying here and nobody knows it\u2019s happening,\u201d she says, trying to get access to the wounded. Later, Colvin is herself wounded and loses an eye, resulting in her wearing a black eye patch for the rest of her life that would become her signature accoutrement.\n\nBut the reality of her injury is brutal. The climax of the movie comes when Colvin writes up a searing account of her semi-blinding. Her face is lit up by the laptop screen. The movie cuts to her having sex with a man she has picked up at a party (later to become her partner). She swigs vodka, types, paces. We cut back to the sex scene, then to her slicing prose, cranked out in the middle of the night. \u201cThe knowledge of the fragility of the human body never leaves you,\u201d she writes, \u201conce you have seen how easily flesh can be rent by hot flying bits of metal.\u201d\n\nThis is the stuff of hard-boiled professionalism, and there\u2019s no denying how well it\u2019s suited to the big screen. But the bluntness of the script is distracting. In her hospital room, she tells a friend that she fears both growing old and dying young. \u201cI\u2019m most happy with vodka martini in my hand, but I can\u2019t stand the fact that the chatter in my head won\u2019t go quiet until there\u2019s a quart of vodka inside me,\u201d she says. It\u2019s expository dialogue without the character-building to back it up. \u201cI hate being in a war zone,\u201d she continues. \u201cBut I also feel compelled ... compelled to see it for myself.\u201d\n\nMaybe Marie Colvin did express herself in this way in real life. But Pike\u2019s performance has something clunky and mechanical about it, a sense that she is trying and failing to inhabit a woman much older and tougher than herself. They look alike: They both have faces made of strong planes, animated by intense, hooded eyes. But Pike, 39, just doesn\u2019t read as a hard-bitten American woman who was 56 when she died.\n\nThe movie plays out in alternating sequences. Now she is in London, drinking and refusing to acknowledge her PTSD. Now she is in Fallujah, narrowly escaping roadside execution. Now she\u2019s drinking again. This time it\u2019s another war. Award ceremony, war, drinking, war: We flicker back and forth. Then we\u2019re in Homs, where she dies."

    "text": "Adapted for television, Homecoming\u2019s narrative plays more like a straightforward drama, and leans heavily on its aesthetic to build tension. In the first episode, Walter (Stephan James) begins his course of therapy with Heidi. He has just returned from a particularly painful tour, on which he lost one of his close friends and fellow soldiers to an IED explosion. Heidi draws Walter out, asking him about his life before joining up and about the jokes he shared in the Army\u2014like the time guys in his unit convinced a soldier named Benji that there was a Titanic sequel called Titanic Rising and made up elaborate plot points. The scene looks like a typical therapy session between a willing patient and a professional who wants to guide him. But as the first episode jumps into the future, we see that just a few years later, everything has gone wrong: Homecoming is closed and classified; Heidi is waitressing at a crab shack, having lost all recollection of the project; and Walter has gone off the grid.\n\nOver the course of several episodes, which dispense clues in a steady drip, we learn that the Homecoming center, despite its many job placement seminars and social skills workshops, was never meant to help soldiers adapt to life back in America. It was, instead, designed as the setting for a secret drug trial. Geist started the center as a place to administer and observe the effects of an experimental new drug on a group of veterans, who had no knowledge of the program\u2019s real purpose. Hidden in the cafeteria food, the drug is supposed to erase their memories of war and leave them trauma-free, so that they can be sent back into battle. Heidi\u2019s part in all this was to check that those memories had disappeared, so Geist could closely measure the drug\u2019s effectiveness. Instead of treating veterans, Homecoming aimed to force them back into endless war.\n\nHeidi\u2019s boss, Colin, is relatively untroubled by the scheme. We watch his conversations with his Lady Macbeth\u2013like wife (Sydney Tamiia Poitier), who encourages him to stay the course\u2014not so much in a spirit of moral support, but because she realizes that he will need to manage his guilt if he is ever going to move up the corporate ladder at Geist and impress the Big Pharma powers that be. But Heidi is much more conflicted. In their therapy sessions, she and Walter bond over dreams of going on a road trip to California together\u2014it might be a romantic fantasy, but it could just as easily be escapism. Both desperately need a way out of a punishing system.\n\nHow did someone so apparently kind and decent end up in this work to begin with? The show slowly reveals Heidi\u2019s trajectory toward Geist: how, after a long string of nothing jobs, she decides that she wants to become a social worker; how after completing her degree she is so desperate to find work in her field (not an easy task for a middle-aged woman with zero experience) that she leaps at the opportunity to work for a big corporation, even though Geist\u2019s methodology is unorthodox and potentially illegal. She convinces herself that she is helping these men; she has to. That is how complicity works.\n\nIn the podcast, Keener played Heidi with a note of sardonic detachment in her voice, a quality that Roberts doesn\u2019t emulate. She\u2019s too naturally warm to play the role with that sort of distance. And yet, there is something about Roberts\u2019s million-dollar smile that makes Heidi even more tragic on screen. In her therapy sessions, she is as magnetic and affable as Roberts has ever been; she draws out her patients\u2019 war memories simply by allowing her eyes to crinkle. And yet, years later, when she meets a Department of Defense investigator who is looking into malfeasance at Homecoming, she turns dogged, intent on uncovering her own role in a rotten system. Here, Roberts plucks the Erin Brockovich chord; she is steely and immovable in the face of corporate wrongdoing. This is her first major television role, and I understand why she took it: It allows her to do the two things she does best\u2014to deploy her killer charm and to bare her teeth against an adversary."

    "text": "In early 2011, when new census figures showed that Evergreen, Alabama, a small city midway between Montgomery and Mobile, had grown from 53 to 62 percent black over the previous ten years, the white majority on the city council took steps to maintain its political dominance. They redrew precinct lines, pushing almost all the city\u2019s black voters into two city council districts. Then, election administrators used utility information to purge roughly 500 registered black voters from the rolls, all but ensuring that whites would maintain their majority on the council and keep control of Evergreen.\n\nThat kind of voter suppression is exactly what the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed to prevent. For 48 years, its \u201cpreclearance\u201d provision barred election officials in states with histories of voter suppression from making changes to election procedures without permission from the federal government. It was far from a perfect system\u2014even with preclearance in place, Evergreen officials were able to purge the rolls\u2014but it did help hundreds of thousands of black Southerners vote. By 1972, black registration rates had reached 50 percent in all but a few Southern states. In 2013, however, in Shelby County v. Holder, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act, striking down the provisions of the law that defined which states fell under preclearance.\n\nSince then, efforts to keep people from voting have intensified. Officials in three states have shrunk early voting time lines, and one eliminated same-day registration. Five have implemented new voter ID laws. In Texas, someone can now vote with a handgun license but not a student ID. Georgia forces voters to use the same name on their application as the one on their ID card; something as trivial as an errant or missing hyphen, a dropped middle name, or the inclusion of an extra initial on an application could prevent someone from voting. (That was how Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State and then\u2013Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp was able to block, if only temporarily, some 53,000 voter registrations, mostly from African Americans.) This year, South Dakota has said people must have a street address to cast a ballot, disenfranchising many Native Americans who, because they live on reservations, only have post office boxes. And just weeks before the midterms, reporters in Dodge City, Kansas, which has a growing Latino population, discovered that election officials gave newly registered voters the wrong polling site address. (The real location was outside of town, a mile from the nearest bus stop.) All told, voters in 23 states faced greater obstacles at their polling places than they did in the midterms eight years ago, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. (There are occasional, if rare, successes. In 2014, for example, citizens of Evergreen were able to bring the city back under federal control after 14 months in federal court.)\n\nIt\u2019s time Democrats think seriously about restoring some of the provisions lost to Shelby. If there is one lesson to draw from the midterms, it\u2019s that the right to vote is a partisan issue. Suppression, framed as election security or a last defense against voter fraud, has become a fundamental tactic of Republican efforts to exhaust, confuse, and disqualify Democratic voters\u2014and to win elections. Democrats must fight for access to the ballot for all citizens, and for the federal oversight necessary to assure it. The new Democratic majority in the House cannot be otherwise sustained."

    "text": "Jair Bolsonaro isn\u2019t big on democracy. The newly elected president has dismissed the notion of human rights as a \u201cdisservice\u201d to Brazil. He has bemoaned the fact that its police force, one of the deadliest in the world, does not have the right to kill more freely, promising to give it \u201ccarte blanche\u201d under his administration. He once proposed using a helicopter to drop pamphlets warning drug dealers to leave poor communities, or be fired upon indiscriminately.\n\nBolsonaro is by far the most prominent elected official to praise the harsh military dictatorship that ruled the country from 1964 to 1985. A retired army captain who served in the military from 1977 to 1988, he was a lackluster soldier whose outsize political ambitions often rubbed senior military figures the wrong way. In 1986, for example, he complained to the press about the lack of pay raises and the dearth of professional prospects for soldiers on active duty. Soon after, he was court-martialed for stoking unrest. (He was accused of plotting to bomb a military barracks and was convicted, but won on appeal, and the charges against him were eventually dropped.) At the time, the military had only recently returned the government to civilian control. But Bolsonaro, unlike many leading figures in the military, never accepted its diminished role in Brazilian life. In his presidential campaign, he selected a general as his vice president and promised to name other military men to key posts in government. He wants to militarize Brazil\u2019s borders and has described the Landless Workers Movement, an organization that occupies large, unproductive estates in the countryside to advocate for land reform and denounce rural inequality, as a terrorist organization. He has pledged, in short, to revive, in spirit if not necessarily by law, the repressive thrust of the military regime.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s alignment with the armed forces follows a clear political logic. The military is the most trusted public institution in Brazil, polling much higher than Congress, which Brazilians see as hopelessly corrupt, or the judiciary, which is viewed as an insular cabal more interested in preserving its own privileges than in administering justice. (Brazilian judges are among the highest paid in the world.)\n\nIn recent years, other leaders in Latin America have profited from a right-wing wave. Mauricio Macri, a conservative multimillionaire, became president of Argentina in 2015; and in 2017, Chileans elected Sebastian Pi\u00f1era, who has brought into his cabinet officials tied to the brutal regime of Augusto Pinochet. But Bolsonaro stands apart for having accomplished something no politician has attempted since democracy was restored across the region almost 30 years ago: He has won a national election as an unabashed champion of military dictatorship."

Some are grotesque or violent, but Femi, for example, didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Ayoola displays no remorse whatsoever. She keeps trying to post cheerfully to Snapchat, and Korede has to explain that it will seem distasteful to act so blithely so soon after Femi\u2019s \u201cdisappearance.\u201d But Ayoola is right in the end\u2014nobody cares. \u201c#FemiDurandIsMissing\u201d causes a minor stir online, but is quickly forgotten.\n\nIt\u2019s this shallowness in Nigerian society writ large that Korede seems to hate most of all. She can\u2019t stand the hypocrisy of men who claim to know Ayoola\u2019s soul when all they see is her face. She can\u2019t stand the auntie who advises her nieces to keep their \u201chair long and glossy or invest in good weaves\u201d so they can hold down a man.\n\nIn Korede\u2019s mind, all these indignities come together. Ayoola\u2019s unearned adulation, the cops who extort her at traffic stops, the petty auntie: they\u2019re all part of the same corrupt order. This knowledge has made her intelligent, wiser than her friends and family, but also angry and alone. \u201cI know better,\u201d she spits about her aunt, \u201cthan to take life directions from someone without a moral compass.\u201d\n\nKorede is seemingly beset on all sides. In the hospital where she works, however, she can exercise autonomy.

Worse, she uses her status at the hospital to belittle others. If Korede is powerless in her own home, always blamed for Ayoola\u2019s mistakes, in the hospital\u2019s white wards she can mock a man who smells bad and deride the junior nurses.

But his sins implicate the children as well. \u201cHe could do a bad thing and behave like a model citizen right after,\u201d she thinks. \u201cAs though the bad thing had never happened.

    "text": "In the months before the midterms, the GOP began sounding the alarm that the Democrats, should they take back the House, were planning a slew of investigations into nearly every aspect of the Trump administration: tax returns, family businesses, Russia, Stormy Daniels, excessive spending by cabinet secretaries, the travel ban, family separation, the failure to adequately respond to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico\u2014and much, much more. In August, Republican leaders and donors began circulating a spreadsheet that listed each potential investigation, over a hundred in all. It was, as Jonathan Swan of Axios wrote, enough to \u201cchurn Republican stomachs\u201d\u2014a secret study of the \u201ccoming hell\u201d that would \u201cturn the Trump White House into a 24/7 legal defense operation.\u201d The document was packaged as merely informational, but its larger message was obvious. Democrats, it implied, were vindictive and out of control, driven less by truth than by revenge fantasies and conspiracy theories.\n\nThere is a difference, though, between conspiracy theory and conspiracy. The latter is a crime\u2014difficult to prove, but nonetheless real. American political history is laden with them; Watergate and Iran-Contra are only the most brazen of recent conspiracies. Conspiracy theories, meanwhile, string unconnected scandals together into an increasingly implausible master narrative orchestrated by a single puppet master. They connect dots that don\u2019t warrant connecting. In September, for example, during the height of the battle over the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, some liberals wondered on Twitter whether Kavanaugh\u2019s unexplained debts\u2014as much as $200,000\u2014held secrets related to the Russia investigation. \u201cMueller should subpoena Kavanaugh to find out whether Trump arranged for one of Putin\u2019s pals to bail Kavanaugh out of his baseball debt,\u201d offered one Twitter user, @zibilith. Two weeks later, Greg Olear, author of Dirty Rubles: An Introduction to Trump/Russia, tweeted about Kavanaugh\u2019s \u201cowned-by-Putin behind.\u201d By this logic, a handful of unrelated crimes are transformed into a Grand Unified Theory of Political Malfeasance.\n\nIs this the new normal on the left? It\u2019s possible, but conspiracy theories are unlikely to take hold of the Democratic Party, especially a newly empowered House majority. Conspiracy theories are, generally speaking, a favored coping mechanism of those who lack power: They flourished among liberals in the wake of Trump\u2019s election. But as Democrats regain power, expect their need for conspiracy theories to decrease.\n\nIt\u2019s far more likely that Democrats will simply start uncovering actual crimes: conspiracies and collusion, both big and small, coordinated and random\u2014along with a host of regular old acts of corruption and graft. Given the preponderance of evidence indicating such transgressions, there is little need for Democrats to promote conspiracy theories. They have more than enough legitimate work to keep their oversight committees busy until 2020 and beyond. The real question is whether they will let themselves be played by the Republican Party, which has descended almost entirely into paranoia."

    "text": "As a result of the 1974 decision, many Northern city desegregation orders were restricted to urban areas. In Boston, the limited, city-based racial desegregation order received enormous pushback and was widely regarded as a failure. The order spawned white flight to the suburbs, leaving behind groups of working-class white and black students, who didn\u2019t experience the achievement benefits associated with broader socioeconomic integration. Moreover, white working-class families seethed at the double standard under which wealthy white suburban liberals lectured them about the importance of integration but did not involve their own children in the enterprise.\n\nIn contrast, many Southern desegregation plans included both cities and suburbs because, in that region of the country, the two tend to lie within single county-wide school systems. In Charlotte, North Carolina, there was no easy escape hatch for white flight, because suburbs were part of the plan. And because more affluent suburban students were included, the plan brought about socioeconomic as well as racial integration. This was critical because research had long found, going back to the 1966 congressionally-authorized Coleman Report, that the \u201cbeneficial effect of a student body with a high proportion of white students comes not from racial composition per se but from the better educational background and higher educational aspirations that are, on average, found among whites.\u201d The Charlotte plan produced strong achievement gains, and in 1984, when Ronald Reagan came to town and harshly denounced busing, his remarks \u201cfell utterly flat and met only silence.\u201d\n\nAmerica\u2019s experiment with desegregation was short-lived, as the New York Times reporter Nikole-Hannah Jones has demonstrated in her writing on the state of today\u2019s schools. In the 1990s, the William Rehnquist Court began releasing jurisdictions from desegregation orders. And in 2007, in Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, the John Roberts Court went further and struck down racial integration plans that had been voluntarily adopted by school boards in Louisville, Kentucky and Seattle, Washington. In order to promote school diversity, the plans treated students differently based on race, which Roberts saw as a violation of Brown. \u201cBefore Brown,\u201d he wrote, \u201cschoolchildren were told where they could and could not go to school based on the color of their skin. The school districts in these cases have not carried the heavy burden of demonstrating that we should allow this once again\u2014even for very different reasons.\u201d\n\nDriver, who clerked for Justice Stephen Breyer at the time of the Parents Involved case, quotes Breyer\u2019s powerful response: \u201cSegregation policies did not simply tell schoolchildren \u2018where they could and could not go to school based on the color of their skin\u2019; they perpetuated a caste system rooted in the institutions of slavery and 80 years of legalized subordination.\u201d Breyer wrote that efforts to continue racial segregation are not \u201cconstitutionally indistinguishable from efforts to achieve racial integration.\u201d Breyer was reaching back to the larger meaning of Brown: that separate schooling for America\u2019s most vulnerable populations undermines the democratic purposes of public education.\n\nDriver goes further to point out that the rationale for using race is even stronger at the K-12 level than in higher education\u2014where the Supreme Court has upheld racial preferences in admissions. The benefits of diversity in the K-12 classroom, Driver observes, apply \u201ceven more compellingly during the students\u2019 most formative years of schooling.\u201d Moreover, a white or Asian high school senior rejected for racial reasons from a selective college after years of hard work surely has a stronger claim than a five-year-old whose race is a factor in not being admitted to his or her parents\u2019 preferred Kindergarten.\n\nThe New York Times denounced the Parents Involved decision with an editorial entitled, \u201cResegregation Now.\u201d But, Driver says, the practical effect of the decision has been limited in some areas because a number of school districts, from Cambridge, Massachusetts to Wake County (Raleigh), North Carolina, have shifted to socioeconomic status (such as eligibility for subsidized lunch) as a basis for integration. These plans provide successful \u201cworkarounds\u201d to Parents Involved because it is perfectly legal to classify students by socioeconomic status, and because class-based integration produces a lot of racial diversity.\n\nThe socioeconomic plans are not merely a clever legal ploy by which to circumvent the Supreme Court. They are also consistent with the social science research finding that the economic status of classmates drives achievement more than race. Today, 100 school districts and charter school chains educating 4 million students use socioeconomic status as a factor in student assignment. Among them is Charlotte, which adopted a plan in 2016 to admit an equal number of low, medium, and high socioeconomic status students to its magnet schools. (The plan, which I assisted Charlotte in creating, was adopted one day after Donald Trump\u2019s election.)\n\nWhen it comes to the critical issue of private school vouchers, Driver is far less persuasive. A central plank in the Trump and Betsy DeVos agenda, vouchers have been found to increase racial and socioeconomic segregation in numerous societies where they have been tried, from Sweden to Chile to Denmark. Yet Driver endorses the idea, against the wisdom of his former boss, Justice Breyer, who noted that vouchers threaten to balkanize American society along religious lines. Driver argues that it is unfair to trap low-income students in failing schools and that vouchers offer those children a way out. Here, he may be reflecting on his own experience as a young student who, living in a poor neighborhood in Washington D.C., had the chance to attend a public school in an affluent area where, he says, \u201cthe educational outcomes were much brighter.\u201d\n\nBut a system of public school choice\u2014like the one Driver availed himself of\u2014is crucially different from a voucher system. It answers the plea for better opportunities, without taking the dangerous step of outsourcing the teaching of democracy to private institutions.\n\nEwing pays closer attention to the importance of a school not just to individual students but also to a whole community, as a source of meaning and pride. In a book brimming with insights, she traces the long history of black struggle with Chicago officials who purposefully created an \u201cinvisible fence\u201d to keep parts of the city\u2014including the Bronzeville section on Chicago\u2019s South side\u2014cordoned off from the rest. The NAACP valiantly fought school segregation but, facing resistance from the powers that be, many black leaders eventually shifted their focus to community control of black schools, and despite enormous obstacles, a number of Bronzeville community members thrived. Over the years, the neighborhood produced Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Gwendolyn Brooks, investigative journalist Ida B. Wells, jazz musician Nat King Cole, and novelist Richard Wright.\n\nGHOSTS IN THE SCHOOLYARD: RACISM AND SCHOOL CLOSINGS ON CHICAGO\u2019S SOUTH SIDE by Eve L. Ewing University of Chicago Press, 240 pp., $22.50\n\nThe school closings took that control away from the community again. Ewing cogently argues that the closings were particularly painful, because in African American communities they are \u201cpart of a broader pattern of disrespect for people of color.\u201d Against the background of slavery, in which black families were routinely dispersed to different communities, she says, the division of school communities rang with an unfortunate familiarity. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m at a slave auction,\u201d one black resident tells school officials, \u201cbegging you to keep my family together. Don\u2019t take them and separate them.\u201d One community member pleaded with school officials: \u201cYou are destroying a family for many children who don\u2019t always have the easiest family situations at their homes.\u201d\n\nOne practical concern for Chicago students, Ewing notes, is the way in which new school feeder patterns can force students to traverse different gang territories. In 2009, for example, one student was beaten to death during a fight, which Ewing says, was \u201cattributed to a student conflict after a school closure and consolidation.\u201d To add insult to injury, many of the schools closed in Chicago were named after prominent African Americans. A school named for black suffragist Mary C. Terrell became ACE Technical Charter School, Sojourner Truth Elementary School became the Chicago International Charter School, and Ralph J. Bunche Elementary School became Providence Englewood Charter School. Ewing sharply points out the effect: \u201cThat\u2019s how you get black history to go away.\u201d\n\nThe closings might have made more sense if the new schools that students attended were clearly superior, but that was rarely the case. A 2009 study found that after an early round of school closures in Chicago, only 6 percent of students transferred to top performing schools. Almost half went to the lowest performing schools where their scores in math and reading on average declined. Finally, unlike in any other Illinois jurisdictions, the Chicago School Board is not elected by the public. (Members are appointed by the mayor). This unusual arrangement added to a sense of powerlessness.\n\nEwing\u2019s stunning account of this recent history underlines the staggering challenge we face in creating the schools necessary to sustain our democracy. We have moved so far away from the concept of equal opportunity for disadvantaged African American students that parents are no longer just fighting for high-quality integrated schools, or even high-quality segregated schools. They are fighting for the right to preserve mediocre schools because what they are likely to be provided in the event of school closure is even worse.\n\nAt a time when our democracy is under stress, Ewing and Driver outline two important paths for strengthening America\u2019s commitment to democratic values. Both require schools to reinforce the lessons about democracy found in textbooks by doing something much harder: asking the adults to model those values. Ewing\u2019s detailed on-the-ground reporting calls on leaders to give basic respect to vulnerable communities and give them a voice in important decisions. Driver goes even further, as he calls on schools to challenge the racial and economic inequality in the broader society. He has the audacity to contend that low-income, black, and brown children have an equal right to share space with more privileged students in a system of public education. Anything less would be undemocratic."

    "text": "You\u2019ll also find yourself on the roof of a mall that was built under Maidan in the 2000s, replacing a hill that from the late 1970s until 1991 was home to a granite Vladimir Lenin statue that gazed over the square.\n\n\u201cThese people have had a chance to become Ukrainian George Washingtons,\u201d says Yurash. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve wasted it.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s up here where you\u2019ll find a side of the new Ukraine that, depending on whom you ask, is talked about too little or too much: Ukraine\u2019s far-right. Stickers of the far-right National Corps, the political party of the Ukrainian National Guard regiment known as the Azov Battalion, are everywhere. Alongside a few soccer hooligan stickers and pieces of extremist graffiti, the National Corps stickers urge young people to \u201cjoin the ranks,\u201d promoting everything from \u201cbrotherhood\u201d to \u201cone blood,\u201d all emblazoned with the party\u2019s logo.\n\nAzov formed in 2014 to fight Russian-backed forces in Ukraine\u2019s east, and quickly earned a reputation as one of the fiercest anti-Russian forces in the country. But it has also openly accepted self-avowed neo-Nazis into its ranks\u2014something that\u2019s made it an easy target for Kremlin propaganda, who jump at opportunities to (incorrectly) claim that Ukraine is run by a fascist \u201cjunta.\u201d Azov formed the National Corps in October 2016; earlier this year, they formed the National Militia, a street patrol that\u2019s taken part in attacks on Roma camps. It helped organize a march in October with more than 10,000 people, including a handful of neo-Nazis from Germany.\n\nSome days you can look over the Maidan from here and see a few National Corps members setting up a recruitment and promotion booth on the sidewalk, handing out the party\u2019s monthly newspaper. The October edition\u2019s cover featured party leader Andriy Biletsky, a man who once wrote about \u201c[leading] the White Races of the world in a final crusade\u2026against the Semite-led subhumans.\u201d\n\nAt the other end of the square, up a side street, they\u2019ve set up a multi-purpose youth center where teens can, among other things, work out and attend lectures on European far-right figures.\n\nIt\u2019s often pointed out that far-right forces have minimal public support\u2014the National Corps even polled a comical 0.1 percent in one recent poll. Currently, there\u2019s little chance of them getting anywhere near Ukraine\u2019s parliament in next year\u2019s elections.\n\nBut the way these fringe forces have wormed their way in with law enforcement\u2014in some cities, including Kiev, they\u2019ve taken part in police patrols and operations\u2014is dangerous, others counter. Volodymyr Ishchenko, a sociologist and lecturer at Kiev Polytechnic Institute, says that far-right forces like the Azov movement have taken advantage of Ukraine\u2019s weak state: They operate with relative impunity and threaten the rights of minorities like Roma and LGBT in Ukraine. Worse, says Ishchenko, many domestic and international supporters try to downplay the issue because they worry it would feed into the Kremlin propaganda tropes about Ukraine being run by fascists and the far-right.\n\nIf it looks like most passers-by couldn\u2019t care less about these teenagers and their free far-right newspapers, it\u2019s because they\u2019ve got plenty of other things to worry about. People like the grandmother taking a photo of her granddaughter as she scrambles up the statue of Cossack Mamay, a Ukrainian warrior-defender folk hero, are more concerned with corruption, pensions and rising prices. Recent polls show that these issues have come close, in citizens\u2019 minds, to edging out the war in eastern Ukraine as the biggest challenge facing the country.\n\nCorruption, activists like Yurash stress, is still a chronic problem in Ukraine. Despite international pressure to tackle the country\u2019s rampant corruption head-on, Ukrainians in one recent poll say they encounter bribery more often now than in 2015. For Yurash, Ukraine\u2019s politicians have sinned in failing to take the fight against corruption seriously\u2014failing to build a new Ukraine in the way that he and others participating in the revolution had hoped.\n\n\u201cThese people have had a chance to become Ukrainian George Washingtons,\u201d says Yurash. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve wasted it.\u201d\n\nAnd, despite some progress, Ukraine\u2019s economy remains weak. A recent study published by Credit Suisse says that Ukraine ranks among the worst countries in terms of its citizens\u2019 median net worth. Many Ukrainians, especially young Ukrainians, are leaving the country to work abroad; according to a poll earlier this year, fewer than one in five Ukrainians under 35 years old felt they had a good future in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI want Ukraine to have a good economy,\u201d says Mariya, 20, working behind a coffee counter as, outside on the Maidan, a motley crew of other young Ukrainians in panda suits and cartoon character costumes bug tourists for selfies and some cash for their troubles.\n\nHope might sound like it\u2019s in short supply, but even critics like Yurash say they\u2019re optimistic, if angry. \u201cMy friends and colleagues from five years ago haven\u2019t gone away,\u201d he says, referring to fellow activists who were on the Maidan beside him. \u201cThey\u2019re still fighting.\u201d\n\nKateryna Kruk, 27, spent more than three months on the Maidan\u201493 days exactly, she says\u2014making a name for herself livestreaming and live-tweeting the protests as they happened. Kruk is candid about how she and other Ukrainians have struggled in the wake of the 2014 revolution and the ongoing war in eastern Ukraine\u2014she talks about how she sometimes has felt like she\u2019s been \u201cdrowning in memories\u2026in dark waters\u201d because of what she\u2019s witnessed and experienced, from seeing bodies in the streets to having friends die at the hands of Russian-backed forces in Ukraine\u2019s east.\n\nBut even as the new Ukraine that she and others fought for seems like a dream sometimes\u2014and as her friends continue to fight a war\u2014activists like Kruk aren\u2019t about to give up. Five years on, the revolution is far from a failure, she says\u2014and it\u2019s not over yet.\n\n\u201cI am not disappointed,\u201d Kruk says, asked about the revolution\u2019s success\u2014or lack thereof\u2014five years later. \u201cI will never be disappointed.\u201d\n\n*An earlier version of this article incorrectly gave the date of the revolution\u2019s deadliest day as February 18, rather than February 20."

    "text": "Other conservative legal figures have been outspoken about Trump in recent weeks. Ted Olson, a former solicitor general and the victor of Bush v. Gore, signed on to represent CNN in its First Amendment lawsuit against the White House for revoking correspondent Jim Acosta\u2019s press credentials. John Yoo, who took a maximalist approach to executive power under President George W. Bush, wrote in The Atlantic that Trump violated the Constitution by naming Matthew Whitaker to be acting attorney general after his boss, Jeff Sessions, was forced to resign. (George Conway published a similar argument in the New York Times last week, co-written by Obama DOJ veteran Neal Katyal.) Adler and others criticized Trump\u2019s threat to end birthright citizenship by executive order on originalism grounds.\n\nWith few exceptions, liberal members of the American legal community have warned since the beginning that Trump posed a threat to American democracy. Many nonpartisan law professors also joined criticism of the travel ban directed at Muslim-majority countries, the administration\u2019s separation of migrant families at the border, and other extreme policies. Legal critiques from the right, however, have been more sporadic until recently. Trump, as a presidential candidate, had struck a Faustian bargain of sorts with top figures in the conservative legal movement: In exchange for outsourcing judicial nominations to them, they would not oppose his takeover of the Republican Party.\n\nHis rise to power came at a fateful time for the movement. Since the 1960s, legal conservatives have dreamed of building a Supreme Court that mirrored their ideological worldview. Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s sudden death in 2016 imperiled decades of work to reshape the federal judiciary in their own image. The possibility that President Hillary Clinton would name his replacement kept the fracturing Republican Party together even as Trump assumed control of it. On Election Night, the gambit paid off. Instead of witnessing the first five-justice liberal majority on the court since Earl Warren, Republicans have now installed justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, securing the court\u2019s ideological makeup for decades. More than 80 federal judges have also been confirmed over the past two years, steadily reshaping the lower courts.\n\nThose accomplishments thrilled conservatives of all stripes. They also kept quiet many in the conservative legal community who had concerns about the Trump administration\u2019s other policies, Adler said. \u201cLast year at the Federalist Society conference, there were press reports about the \u2018But Gorsuch\u2019 stress ball,\u201d he noted. \u201cAnd it\u2019s significant that they were \u2018but Gorsuch,\u2019 not \u2018and Gorsuch,\u2019 right? And it was a stress ball. The reason I think it was so popular is because there are a lot of people in FedSoc who are happy about judicial nominations, and were hoping that the judicial nominations would outweigh other things.\u201d\n\nThe American left tends to picture the Federalist Society as a monolithic institution, one that grows originalist judges from giant cloning vats in its basement. In reality, it functions more like a decentralized social network and debate club, one where reputation is the coin of the realm. Checks and Balances\u2019 members are effectively using that currency to provide cover for others who may fear professional reprisals from a vindictive White House, and to preemptively defuse attempts to paint members as conservative apostates.\n\n\u201cConcerns that I endorsed about the birthright citizenship proposal are based on the original public meaning of the constitutional text,\u201d Adler noted, referring to Trump\u2019s threat not to guarantee citizenship to everyone born in the U.S. \u201cCriticism about the Justice Department not being sufficiently nonpartisan are based on traditional principles about what the role of the Justice Department is and what the role of law enforcement is.... We\u2019re not abandoning our prior ideological affinities. In many ways, we\u2019re seeking to reinvigorate them and see that they are upheld in this more challenging environment.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that liberals are no stranger to devil\u2019s bargains themselves. Many Democrats brushed aside Bill Clinton\u2019s sexual misconduct in the 1990s because of their support for his policies and desire to keep Republicans out of the White House. Today, the American left might be skeptical of making common cause with their ideological adversaries, and rightly so. Many of those adversaries stayed silent over the past two years as Trump relentlessly weakened American democracy\u2014and quietly applauded as he delivered one staunch conservative to the courts after another.\n\nBut if, as 2020 nears, Trump\u2019s reelection chances are slim and no Supreme Court justices retire or die\u2014two very big ifs, admittedly\u2014the number of conservative critics may well grow. \u201cI think there are quite a number of people that do have conflicts, and I think for a lot of people that conflict\u2019s grown over time,\u201d Adler said. \u201cI think there are also people who think the administration\u2019s ability to produce silver linings that outweigh the cloud is diminishing. If that means more people who are willing to criticize the administration when it does wrong, that\u2019d be good.\u201d\n\nPerhaps some of these people will feel that the rule of law has become significantly more imperiled than it was in Trump\u2019s early years. Others may simply conclude that, after the decisive rightward shift of the Supreme Court and the transformation of the most important lower courts, it is time to burnish their reputations for the post-Trump era. Whatever their reasons, the left ought to welcome them to the resistance.\n\nI\u2019m reminded of a high-school math teacher who would penalize me on a test when I got a question correct but used the wrong method. Sometimes, how one gets to the right answer matters less than getting there at all."

    "text": "The Philadelphia Convention\u2019s denial of property in man, writes Wilentz, was profoundly and fatefully important:\n\nIt rendered slavery solely a creation of state laws. It thereby opened the prospect of a United States free of slavery\u2014a prospect some delegates deeply desired and many more believed was coming to pass. Above all, it left room for the new federal government to hinder slavery\u2019s expansion, something which, after the Constitution\u2019s ratification, slavery\u2019s opponents struggled to achieve.\n\nSouthern slaveholders not only sought to expand slavery in the West, but they wanted to establish that slaves were indeed property and that the Constitution actually recognized them as property. The conflicts over this issue of property in man, writes Wilentz, \u201cbecame the crux of the political struggles that led to the Civil War.\u201d The story of these political struggles, which \u201clies at the heart of American history,\u201d has been \u201clargely forgotten.\u201d His book, he says, aims to remedy this lapse of memory and to explain how and why all these conflicts took place.\n\nWilentz presented the arguments in this book as talks and writings to different groups both before and after delivering them as the Nathan I. Huggins Lectures at Harvard University. His book retains, he says, the same basic arguments as his many lectures and writings, but it has been \u201cimproved with the benefit of valuable comments, queries, and objections from friends, colleagues, and critics.\u201d In today\u2019s academic climate, the criticism he received was obviously \u201clively and even sharp, befitting the importance of the subjects at hand.\u201d His publicist says that his views created \u201ca massive controversy amongst historians.\u201d This is not surprising: Wilentz was stepping on a lot of neo-Garrisonian scholarly toes.\n\nWilentz has responded to all this sharp criticism by absorbing it and refining and enriching his argument to the point where he is more than fair to every objection. He goes out of his way to admit much of the truth of the current neo-Garrisonian scholarship. He recognizes, for example, that the North was also implicated in the system of slavery. He points out that emancipation in the North, for which Northerners constantly congratulated themselves, was very gradual. Indeed, it was so gradual that there were still slaves in the federal census in Pennsylvania in 1840 and even a few slaves yet to be freed in New Jersey as late as 1865. Northern emancipation hardly delivered the slaves or their children from oppressive conditions; poverty forced many ex-slaves to enter themselves or their children into long-term indentured servitude. And, of course, rarely did the ex-slaves in the North gain equal civic rights with whites.\n\nWilentz is willing to concede much of the neo-Garrisonian criticism of the Constitution. He readily acknowledges that the Southern delegates to the Constitutional Convention won victory after victory in their efforts to protect slavery, while the Northern delegates seemingly won only a linguistic one. It was well and good that slavery was not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, but, as the fiery anti-slavery advocate Luther Martin pointed out, this was something of a sleight of hand. The delegates may have managed to avoid \u201cexpressions which may be odious in the ears of Americans,\u201d but they actually admitted \u201cinto their system those things which the expressions signified.\u201d\n\nDespite all his concessions to current neo-Garrisonian scholarship, however, Wilentz was determined to hold on to one crucial point\u2014that the Constitution never acknowledged property in man. That point, says Wilentz, saved the United States; it allowed Lincoln to invoke the founders on behalf of the nation and to mobilize the North in support of the Constitution. It effectively prepared \u201cfor a nation in which there was no slavery.\u201d\n\nThe section of the Constitution that came closest to classifying slaves as property was the fugitive slave clause of Article IV, Section 2. Eventually, as the Southerners\u2019 great apologist John C. Calhoun came to appreciate, the issue of fugitive slaves became \u201cthe gravest and most vital of all questions, to us and the whole Union.\u201d It is not surprising therefore that Andrew Delbanco in his book has focused on the problem of fugitive slaves. No issue came to inflame the passions of the two sections more than that of runaway slaves. It created a war between North and South that preceded the actual Civil War.\n\nAlthough Delbanco covers the same time period and deals with the same events and compromises as Wilentz, his book is very different. While Wilentz sticks pretty close to the chronology of events, and focuses on his argument that the Constitution supports no property in man with persuasive and laserlike intensity, Delbanco tends to meander and jump about in time and comment on events in an essayistic fashion. Perhaps this is because Delbanco is technically not a historian but a literary scholar. Always attentive to language, he enriches his discussion with many references to novels, poems, and other literary works, not all of which are drawn from the antebellum decades. At one point, he even cites some lines from a Philip Roth novel.\n\nThe two authors are also writing for different readers. Wilentz had his fellow historians in mind as his principal readers; they are the ones who doubt the Constitution\u2019s legitimacy as an anti-slavery document. By contrast, Delbanco seems to be reaching beyond scholars to a more general readership. He has read and cites an enormous number of primary and secondary sources, unfortunately sometimes mingling quotations from them without identifying the author in his text. But he has the happy habit of explaining and clarifying what many historians, writing for mainly other scholars, take for granted. Wilentz assumes his readers know the evils of slavery; Delbanco vividly demonstrates those evils.\n\nWith his background as a literary scholar, Delbanco is less interested in recounting events and moving his narrative along than in exploring the moral ambiguities and complexities of individuals in the past who had to deal with slavery. He thus tends to ignore those who had no moral dilemmas. He is not concerned with the smug anti-slavery clergymen ensconced in Boston railing against the brutality of the Southern slaveholders a thousand miles away. Instead, he focuses on William Greenleaf Eliot, a New England minister opposed to slavery who decided in 1834 to answer the call to fill the pulpit of the First Unitarian Church in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nLiving in this slave state, Eliot worked tirelessly to alleviate the condition of slaves and other downtrodden and oppressed people in St. Louis. But, much to the confusion of those who knew him, Eliot, \u201cwho hated slavery with every fiber of his being,\u201d in all of the 25 years leading up to the Civil War never supported and indeed opposed the abolitionist agitators\u2014out of fear that a \u201cwar would only serve the interests of the slave owners.\u201d \u201cIn order to come to terms with such a man,\u201d writes Delbanco,\n\none must try to grasp what it meant to live with a hatred of slavery but without knowledge of the imponderable future.\u2026 If the dreaded war came no one could know whether it would end with slavery weakened or strengthened, perpetuated or destroyed.\n\nDelbanco is keenly aware that people living in the antebellum period did not know what we today know: their future. \u201cWe know what predictions were right and which were wrong,\u201d he writes. \u201cTo recover some sense of how it felt for Americans to live through those years requires an effort to imagine their ignorance of what was to come.\u201d\n\nPerhaps reading and teaching writers like Hawthorne and Melville have helped Delbanco better appreciate what he calls \u201cthe contradictions of the human heart.\u201d Many present-day historians dealing with issues of race and slavery tend to approach the past as prosecuting attorneys eager to bring all those culprits in the past to justice. They indict some in the antebellum period for their timidity and caution because they feared a war and did not know what to do, and applaud others who turned out to guess right about the course of events. Delbanco has too subtle a sensibility, too fine an appreciation of the tragedy of life, for that crude kind of history writing. Although he describes the brutality of slavery with force and clarity, and his feelings about slavery are never in doubt, he nevertheless displays a compassion for all the people, slaveholders included, caught up in circumstances they could scarcely control or even fully comprehend."

    "text": "The New Dealers saw that economic power and political power were intrinsically linked. In Germany, an unequal economy had enabled tyranny. \u201cHere was arbitrary power without public control,\u201d Thurman Arnold, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division, wrote in a 1940 book. The country \u201cbecame [economically] organized to such an extent that it needed a general and Hitler leaped into power; had it not been Hitler it would have been someone else.\u201d After the war, Arnold\u2019s lieutenants joined teams working on the Marshall Plan and pushed Germany to adopt antitrust laws. The aggressive competition laws of today\u2019s European Union thus have the New Dealers as one of their ancestors. Democratizing Europe required democratizing the economy in Europe.\n\nThis principle is, however, often overlooked in analysis of crises today: A stream of books and commentary on the return of authoritarianism around the world\u2014Fascism: A Warning; How Democracies Die\u2014largely undervalues the relationship between economics and politics. While their authors fear the breakdown of constitutional norms and a loss of faith in democratic institutions, they have far too little to say about widening inequality and the rising concentration of economic power. In today\u2019s global contest between democracy and nationalist oligarchy, economic power is a critical element and, as a result, antitrust law is an essential tool.\n\nThe author of The Attention Merchants and The Master Switch, Wu weaves his considerable knowledge of the technology and communications industries seamlessly into the arc of antitrust history\u2014and to good effect. We learn how the breakup of AT&T in 1984 accelerated the rise of home internet connections: Whereas the telecommunications giant previously had a monopoly on equipment like phones that used its phone jacks, more people now began to buy their own phones, as well as new devices such as answering machines and modems. We see how the case against IBM in the 1970s kept Big Blue from tying its hardware and software together, and so allowed the computer hardware industry of the 1980s to flourish. And we see how prosecuting Microsoft\u2019s practice of bundling its products together facilitated a more open software industry, one that helped foster tech innovation in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nYet even as these victories were being won, the paradigm was shifting. With the demise of a three-decade liberal era in the 1970s and the rising power of neoliberal ideology, Bork\u2019s book found a ready audience. His approach, which came to be associated with the Chicago School of law and economics, took hold of the entire field over the ensuing decades, though its power derived more from simplicity than accuracy. The Chicago School approach turned theoretical assumptions (there is always a threat of possible competition) into broad assertions about the world (companies never raise prices for fear of this competition). The effect was to reframe monopolists: Rather than being predators and oppressors, these \u201cgentle giants\u201d lived in fear of competition, while seeking only to make the economy more efficient. They thus posed no threat to consumer welfare.\n\nTo call the logic questionable would be charitable, as predatory corporate behavior captures the headlines year after year. But the consumer welfare approach was gaining favor. \u201cDuring the [George W.] Bush years, the anti-monopoly provisions of the Sherman Act went into a deep freeze from which they have never really recovered,\u201d Wu writes. With the Microsoft case settled, the Bush Justice Department didn\u2019t bring any serious anti-monopoly antitrust cases and didn\u2019t block any major mergers. And since Microsoft\u2014some twenty years ago\u2014there have been no big cases \u201ctargeting an industry-spanning monopolist or super-monopolist, seeking the goal of breakup.\u201d By 2004, in the case of Verizon v. Trinko, Justice Antonin Scalia could write for the Supreme Court that the \u201cmere possession of monopoly power, and the concomitant charging of monopoly prices, is not only not unlawful; it is an important element of the free-market system.\u201d In other words, antitrust laws were far from being anti-monopoly in motivation; they recognized and accepted the value of monopolies.\n\nOf course, Scalia\u2019s and Bork\u2019s positions were political, despite their claims of neutrality. It is a political choice to argue for a policy that includes some factors (consumer prices) and excludes others (size, influence, political power). Just as it is a political choice to put a thumb on the scale in favor of mergers, against enforcement, and for consolidation. And it is a political choice to believe in monopolists when they claim they are simply trying to make the world a better place.\n\nWu also seeks to point the way forward for a neo-Brandeisian approach to antitrust law. The Curse of Bigness is neither an academic book nor a policy brief, so his prescriptions are more a sketch of an agenda than a blueprint for reform. But they include most of the main components that must accompany an antitrust revival: reforms to merger policy, more big prosecutions, breakups of existing conglomerates, industrywide investigations, and a rethinking of the consumer welfare standard.\n\nOne omission is surprising. When compared to most areas of domestic regulation, antitrust is exceptional because the courts\u2014not regulatory agencies\u2014are the central policymakers. This makes little sense, as judges are not experts in economic policy-making, nor are they meant to have a leading policy- making role in our constitutional system. Taking antitrust policy-making away from the courts and rooting it back in Congress and regulatory agencies must also be a core part of neo-Brandeisian reforms.\n\n\u201cWe must decide very quickly what sort of country we want to live in,\u201d Senator Estes Kefauver said in debates over his 1950 Anti-Merger Act. \u201cThrough monopolistic mergers the people are losing power to direct their own economic welfare. When they lose the power to direct their economic welfare they also lose the means to direct their political future.\u201d Sweeping in scope, The Curse of Bigness is probably the best popular account of the history of American antitrust law and policy. It captures the stakes in the battle for antitrust\u2014and it cuts to the heart of one of the central questions of our time: Can democracy survive?"

    "text": "When Novey\u2019s women find they can\u2019t trust their own judgment, they spiral into a crisis. Her first novel, Ways to Disappear, is similar in structure to Those Who Knew, composed of short narrated sections, text from radio broadcasts, dictionary entries, and emails. It, too, focuses on a woman pursuing a quest that is urgent but also vague and confusing to her: A professor and translator, Emma Neufeld flees her mostly comfortable life and fianc\u00e9 in Pittsburgh to travel to Rio when she learns the author whose work she\u2019s devotedly translated for years, Beatriz Yagoda, has climbed into an almond tree with a suitcase and cigar and vanished. As in Those Who Knew, an intriguing magical realist beginning gives way to practical concerns: A loan shark threatens, and though Beatriz\u2019s two adult children knew of previous gambling debts, the author\u2019s laptop reveals negative sums that even their wealthy aunts in S\u00e3o Paolo can\u2019t be asked to cover.\n\nWhile Emma starts out confident that her deep knowledge of Beatriz\u2019s work will yield clues to the author\u2019s whereabouts, she\u2019s quickly deflated. Traveling to significant locations in Beatriz\u2019s fiction\u2014accompanied by her gorgeous adult son, who soon becomes Emma\u2019s lover\u2014only leaves Emma with a horrific sunburn. She finds she\u2019s been too straightforward, too literal in her approach to both her author\u2019s work and her own life; she\u2019s missing a sense of ingenuity and risk. On a previous trip to Brazil, Emma \u201cconfessed she hadn\u2019t been quite as dutiful in her last translation as in Beatriz\u2019s earlier books, and Beatriz had replied that duty was for clergy. For translation to be art,\u201d the author told her, \u201cyou have to make the uncomfortable but necessary transgressions that an artist makes.\u201d\n\nNow, indeed, Emma feels she\u2019s transgressed by showing up to help with the search without being asked: She worries that \u201cin coming to Brazil in her author\u2019s absence, she had put herself on trial.\u201d Standing in her author\u2019s bathroom, leaving her own hair in her author\u2019s hairbrush, Emma begins to imagine herself in a courtroom: Dozens of spectators were squinting at her.... Her hands and arms had turned hazy at the edges.... Yet everyone in the gallery \u2026 could see her, or at least found her legible enough to be tried for her alleged crimes.\n\nA translator\u2019s failure to be \u201cpresent but invisible\u201d is of course not an actual crime, but Emma\u2019s sense of transgression\u2014like Lena\u2019s guilt at not having blown the whistle on Victor\u2019s abuses\u2014feels like the only available response to the impasse she\u2019s reached. She is only confident that she can\u2019t be confident about anything. Both she and Lena feel they must do something with their knowledge, even as they realize that knowledge is elusive and anyway does not bring much power at all.\n\nOf course, faced with problems borne of vast, intricate political systems, hand-wringing is not much use either. In this, Novey might present a bleak vision of the world, but she also allows her characters to carve out spaces for resistance, and even to build a life outside politics. This is also probably why, despite the suffering she depicts on many levels, both novels have endings that are, if not happy, at least partially optimistic. If her characters can\u2019t enact the justice they want, they\u2019re still able to respond to their circumstances in their personal lives, difficult as that may sometimes be.\n\nMost of the characters in Those Who Knew have learned to read power, and their happiness is related partly to their willingness, or not, to ignore it. Olga keeps her bookstore afloat by dealing pot on the side, and she smokes a lot of it to cope with the loss of the \u201clove of her life,\u201d who was disappeared by the regime years before; there\u2019s also an entire section of the shop labeled conspiracy, targeted to \u201cearnest-faced young northerners\u201d\u2014 Novey leaves little doubt that they are Americans\u2014who backpack across the island hoping to pick up souvenirs in the form of disintegrating volumes of Trotsky and Marx dug up from people\u2019s backyards once they were legal to own again.\n\nNovey might present a bleak vision of the world, but she also allows her characters to carve out spaces for resistance, even to build a life outside politics.\n\nLena begins an affair with one of these northerners, a very blond baker named Oscar, but their tender, promising romance is cut short when they wake up one morning to the news of \u201cthe attack.\u201d On television they watch \u201ca fuzzy feed of an immense, distant building, the upper half of it in flames. Beside it, another structure was engulfed in smoke.\u201d Oscar\u2019s incredulity\u2014\u201cThis sort of incomprehensible thing didn\u2019t happen in his country\u201d\u2014annoys Lena, though of course she\u2019s always been insulated from political incomprehensibility, too.\n\nWhen he asks how she could eat while they watch the towers collapse, only to stare at her breasts moments later, she flies into a rage at his uneven sensitivities: \u201cI can\u2019t eat because your city is the one on fire for once but you can stare at my chest because you\u2019re the northerner and you get to set the rules for everyone.\u201d He claims he\u2019s traveled to the island to understand what his government did there; she wonders if that involves \u201cscrewing women who are supposed to feel grateful and lucky when you show up with dinner for them?\u201d They don\u2019t see each other again for years, and when they do, Lena commits what could be considered either a betrayal or an act of mercy, depending on which of them you believe has the power.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Victor, the revered progressive, campaigning to eliminate tuition and improve the island\u2019s schools, among other valiant causes. Even if we never learn, for sure, what happened with Maria, it is clear that he\u2019s a violent misogynist, who relishes manipulating women. (He prefers women, he says, with \u201cideas of their own, ideas they were hungry for him to hear and respond to\u201d so that he can be \u201cthe one to dispense the sentence or two of affirmation they were after, and gauge what might happen after that.\u201d) But that doesn\u2019t mean he sees justice. Within the morass of the personal and political that Novey depicts, there are certain dead ends. One of Novey\u2019s more direct statements on this concerns Victor\u2019s eventual fate: Though Lena continues to feel guilt for her \u201cpassive role\u201d in the suffering he\u2019s inflicted, his ultimate comeuppance, after a long downward spiral, is related not to his abuse of women, but to a crime he commits against a man."

Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s intimate yet epic Roma, the story of a young maid and the fracturing family she works for in early-1970s Mexico City, is a sweeping autobiographical film whose pellucid 65mm format and stunning set-pieces demand to be seen on the largest possible screen. And yet, most people in America who see Roma will watch it on their television. Only Netflix would give Cuar\u00f3n the funding and creative control he needed to make his masterpiece.\n\nSince its inception\u2014but particularly since it pivoted to streaming video in 2007\u2014Netflix has spent billions in pursuit of a single goal: to monopolize as much of its customers\u2019 time as possible. \u201cThere are only so many hours of viewer consumption in the world,\u201d The Ringer\u2019s Sean Fennessey wrote earlier this year. \u201cNetflix wants as many of them as possible.\u201d Now, having conquered television and genre filmmaking, it is wading into prestige filmmaking. \u201cFacing rising competition from Walt Disney Co. and other media giants entering the streaming business, Netflix is increasingly eager to lure filmmakers who want their movies to be shown on a big screen and get awards recognition,\u201d The Los Angeles Times reported on Sunday.\n\nThe movie business is ripe for this type of disruption. Over the last decade, industry consolidation has pressured the major studios to reduce their investment in prestigious, mid-budget movies in favor of more bankable, mega-budget movies\u2014thus the increasing reliance on film franchises like The Avengers and The Fast and the Furious. (In the first three months of this year, Marvel\u2019s Black Panther accounted for a quarter of all ticket sales.) Streaming services are stepping into the void, providing homes for directors who otherwise would have to choose between making superhero films or low-budget Sundance fare. Amazon Studios has already produced a major Oscar winner in 2017\u2019s Manchester By the Sea, and Disney, which owns both Marvel and Star Wars, is unveiling a streaming service next year.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of discussion around the way the movies are shown, whether or not they have theatrical releases or just go up on the platform,\u201d director Joel Coen, whose The Ballad of Buster Scruggs was available on Netflix just a week after a limited theatrical run, recently told the Times. \u201cBut I think the more fundamental thing is that they\u2019re the people who are stepping up and spending money on movies that aren\u2019t Marvel comics movies or big action franchise movies and that type of thing.\u201d\n\n"

    "text": "\u201cThere was the option of re-thinking [Rookie] entirely as a whole new thing, like a mentoring app or something,\u201d Gevinson said. \u201cAnd then there was just expanding it as it was, and that would have involved events, merch, a lot more content, more books.\u201d There are publications out there with business models that could have worked for Rookie, Gevinson said. But she had no interest in turning Rookie into \u201ca huge multi-faceted brand. A lifestyle brand.\u201d\n\nGevinson\u2019s tussle with media\u2019s venture capital topography speaks to the difficulty now facing young writers. Rookie helped to define a kind of intimate and playful \u201cvoiciness\u201d in online writing\u2014funny horoscopes, grief counseling, and printable coloring pages, all in the same space\u2014that has now spread across platforms as various as mattress startups, Instagram, and conglomerate media, like the Cond\u00e9 Nast-owned site Them. There are now countless business guides to building an online lifestyle brand community, and the essential message is: \u201cBuild Rookie, but use it to sell things.\u201d It has gotten harder to tell what is \u201creal\u201d writing, and what is designed simply to generate revenue.\n\nIn some cases, Rookie-style content has simply moved. \u201cSometimes on The Cut or Elle or Glamour, or one of those, I see things that feel like could have been on Rookie,\u201d Gevinson said. She also pointed out that teen writing will likely flourish with or without well-funded platforms. \u201cA lot of people, at least who I talk to at Rookie events\u2014young teens\u2014have blogs,\u201d she said. \u201cI think in media-world, we say, \u2018Oh, blogs are over, no one has a blog anymore, or no one reads them.\u2019 But that doesn\u2019t mean that a whole new generation of people aren\u2019t interested in writing, and chronicling their lives in a deeper way than is maybe possible on social media.\u201d\n\nThere are now countless business guides to building an online lifestyle brand community, and the essential message is: \u201cBuild Rookie, but use it to sell things.\u201d\n\nBut Gevinson sounded disillusioned, even frustrated, when we talked about the more cynical women\u2019s media enterprises\u2014the Refinery29s and Bustles of the world. \u201cOther people already capitalized on and monetized what we did,\u201d she said.\n\nThe difficulty with trying to keep Rookie alive through venture capital money was that she had to face down precisely the people who want to use her voice to sell things, but seemed to have no insight into that ouroboros dynamic. \u201cI\u2019m just so relieved that I don\u2019t have to sit across from another person who says something like, \u2018I\u2019m a storyteller at heart,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWhat? You are? I thought you were a venture capitalist. I thought you were the CEO of a startup.\u201d Pushing products is not the same as publishing. \u201cIf you were a storyteller, you\u2019d be telling stories.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Rookie was just intrinsically stuck at a small size, because you can\u2019t scale voice-driven intimacy into a big brand without losing the authenticity behind it. If it had become massive, Rookie would have turned into a catalog, not a magazine.\n\nGevinson is now acting and working on a book. She\u2019s looking forward to reading more and has three stacks of books next to her bed. Elena Ferrante is there, along with some childhood books she wants to return to: To Kill a Mockingbird, The View From Saturday by E. L. Konigsburg.\n\nFor readers who loved Rookie and The Hairpin and The Toast, the loss of those publications and the rise of lifestyle-branded journalism has been distressing. But youth media is inevitably generational: Each round of smart young people has to reinvent the form for themselves. \u201cThere are a lot of people saying, \u2018This is so sad. I read it every day,\u2019\u201d Gevinson said. \u201cBut there are also a lot of people saying, \u2018I\u2019m sad to hear this because it helped me a lot when I was growing up.\u2019 And I feel like that is also an indication the time has come. Rookie was partly inspired by Sassy. And maybe someone else will be inspired by Rookie and make something better and smarter.\u201d\n\nThere is no avoiding the reality that Rookie succeeded in part because it was so tethered to Gevinson as an individual. What happens when your personal brand becomes appropriated\u2014not just by inspired readers (which is partly the point), but by a money-starved industry desperate for the key to a girl\u2019s heart? The worst-case scenario is that the \u201cbullshit becomes so acceptable and insidious that we notice some bullshit but not all,\u201d Gevinson said. She sounded genuinely exhausted when we spoke\u2014not burned out creatively, but just tired. The problem with editing good long-form writing, we agreed, is that there is no way to speed it up. \u201cThere really isn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to have room for surprises and tangent.\u201d It will be up to new writers to find the means and the space to do that laborious work. But Gevinson is optimistic: \u201cThere will always be young people making what they need for themselves.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated to remove comments that were provided off the record."

    "text": "Nine months ago, President Donald Trump brushed off growing criticism of his escalating trade war with China and a host of traditional American allies. \u201cWhen a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with,\u201d he tweeted, \u201ctrade wars are good, and easy to win.\u201d\n\nIn recent days, after a \u201chighly successful\u201d working dinner with Chinese Premier Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit, Trump has all but declared victory in the trade war. On Saturday, he described the potential agreement as \u201cone of the largest deals ever made,\u201d and tweeted on Monday:\n\nMy meeting in Argentina with President Xi of China was an extraordinary one. Relations with China have taken a BIG leap forward! Very good things will happen. We are dealing from great strength, but China likewise has much to gain if and when a deal is completed. Level the field! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2018\n\nFarmers will be a a very BIG and FAST beneficiary of our deal with China. They intend to start purchasing agricultural product immediately. We make the finest and cleanest product in the World, and that is what China wants. Farmers, I LOVE YOU! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2018\n\nPresident Xi and I have a very strong and personal relationship. He and I are the only two people that can bring about massive and very positive change, on trade and far beyond, between our two great Nations. A solution for North Korea is a great thing for China and ALL! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2018\n\nTrump\u2019s version of events differed substantially from the White House\u2019s version, and from reality. As Vox\u2019s Jen Kirby pointed out, the potential agreement is \u201cmore of a trade-war time out\u201d than a resolution of the issues that led the United States and China to this point. Trump has simply offered to delay raising an additional $200 billion in tariffs; the two countries have 90 days to come to an agreement. In a cautious statement, the White House noted that China had agreed to purchase \u201ca not yet agreed upon, but very substantial\u201d amount of American products in order \u201cto reduce the trade imbalance between our two countries.\u201d This is probably good news for both countries and the suddenly sputtering global economy, but it\u2019s nothing close to the success that Trump is claiming.\n\n\n\nThis fits a familiar pattern. Trump ratchets up hostilities with foreign governments in an attempt to negotiate (or renegotiate) deals that are more favorable to the U.S. But then he agrees only to superficial changes, which he nonetheless presents as historic wins that only he could accomplish. It\u2019s a reminder that his real skill as a businessman\u2014and now a politician\u2014was never in making deals, but in marketing himself as a dealmaker. While that proved effective on the campaign trail in 2016, it may come back to haunt him in 2020."

    "text": "In the classic comic strip Calvin and Hobbes, the titular characters occasionally play a game known as \u201cCalvinball.\u201d The rules are simple: Hobbes makes them up as he goes. In one strip, the imaginary stuffed tiger declares mid-game that Calvin has entered an \u201cinvisible sector\u201d and must cover his eyes \u201cbecause everything is invisible to you.\u201d The six-year-old boy obeys and asks Hobbes how he gets out. \u201cSomeone bonks you with the Calvinball!\u201d Hobbes exclaims, chucking the volleyball at Calvin. And so it goes until Calvin, in the final panel, is dizzy and disoriented. \u201cThis game,\u201d he notes, \u201clends itself to certain abuses.\u201d\n\nAmerican democracy is starting to feel the same way. In November\u2019s midterm elections, voters across the country handed the Democratic Party 40 House seats, control of multiple state legislatures, and an assortment of governorships and other state offices. Now, one month later, GOP lawmakers in multiple states are using lame-duck sessions to hamstring incoming Democratic elected officials, either by reducing their official powers or transferring them to Republican-led legislatures.\n\nMuch has been written about Trumpism and the threat it poses to American democratic governance, and rightly so. But these state-level tactics aren\u2019t new. Over the past decade, Republican lawmakers in North Carolina mastered the strategy of constitutional hardball to preserve their political muscle even as their electoral advantage shrank. The metastasis of this model today may be an even greater threat to the nation\u2019s political health than Trump himself.\n\nIn the November elections in Michigan, after a long period of Republican rule, Democrats captured the governorship and the offices of the secretary of state and attorney general after a long period of Republican rule. Now, Republican legislators are weighing measures that would diminish the powers of the latter two positions. One proposal would give state lawmakers the legal standing to defend laws in court when the attorney general declines to do so. Another would transfer the secretary of state\u2019s oversight over campaign-finance regulations to a new oversight board, whose members would be equally chosen by the governor and the legislature.\n\n"

    "text": "\u201cApproaching someone out of the blue and just trying to talk someone out of their beliefs is not successful,\u201d King acknowledged. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to hear that they\u2019re racist. They don\u2019t want to hear that they\u2019re part of a racist system, and that they are complicit in what is happening to their fellow human beings.\u201d As much as King believes in working to end racism, there are days when she feels like it is impossible. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know how we move beyond this, especially as we progress with technology,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is so easy for people to be so connected and disconnected at the same time.\u201d\n\nIt would be nice to believe that people leave extremist groups because they suddenly realize that their views are ugly, hurtful, and prone to cause violence. However, according to research by Peter Simi, a sociologist at Chapman University in Orange County, California, most former white supremacists do not experience a sudden change of heart. In fact, moral reasons fall to the bottom of the list. Instead, as was the case with Shannon Brown, the decision to leave a hate group is almost always driven by a personal stimulus: a social or family feud, a divorce, an abusive relationship, a split between rival factions, a public shaming, a run-in with the legal system. The choice is rarely brought on by empathy for people they have been conditioned to despise. \u201cWe call it \u2018defaulting back to the mean,\u2019\u201d Simi said. This is when people exit violent extremist groups, only to rejoin the \u201cpolite racists.\u201d\n\nThis is why former white supremacists like Brown often struggle with persistent racist feelings, even after they\u2019ve cut ties with their pasts. Counseling former extremists about their childhood, as a treatment method on its own, will not work. Simply exposing them to diverse people won\u2019t do the job either. Any solution will be more complex, because hate is more complex. It\u2019s a socially, historically, and institutionally bred behavior that embeds in the psyche. Solving the problem is not a matter of just getting someone to leave a hate group. Hate and racism become part of their core identity, Simi said, and for many who leave hate behind socially, abandoning it psychologically is a much harder process. Simi calls this the \u201changover effect.\u201d Hatred has an insidious way of hanging on, never quite disappearing, even for the ones who want to wish it away the most.\n\nDespite the research, historical notions of racism as a \u201cdisorder\u201d that can be measured and treated continue to imbue modern race science. The widely used Implicit Association Test, for example, which measures how mental associations can influence behavior\u2014how our minds link concepts, assessments, and stereotypes about other people\u2014characterizes implicit bias as an infection we are exposed to throughout our lives. Psychiatrists Carl Bell and Edward Dunbar describe racism in the 2012 Oxford Handbook of Personality Disorders as a kind of \u201cpublic health pathogen.\u201d\n\nSuch thinking about racism as a disease that can be treated has led some scientists to forge ahead in search of a neurological or pharmaceutical cure. The idea that, one day, people might be able to treat racism as easily as they alleviate heartburn is certainly tantalizing. Indeed, in 2008, a philosopher proposed the idea of a \u201cpill for prejudice,\u201d to reduce the influence of bias on judicial decisions, after the drug propranolol\u2014a beta-blocker that relieves hypertension and reduces anxiety by interrupting stress hormones and is used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder\u2014was found to also reduce implicit bias in a sample of white people for a short period of time.\n\nOther experiments have shown that it is possible to counteract racist thoughts at least temporarily. In six studies involving nearly 23,000 people, Calvin Lai found that playing up vivid counter-stereotypes was very effective at reducing biases within individuals. In one experiment, researchers asked subjects to imagine \u201cbeing kidnapped by an evil middle-aged white man, only to be saved by a dashing young black hero.\u201d Within minutes, the subjects had decreased the intensity of their biases and the speed at which they made prejudiced associations by 50 percent. There\u2019s a catch, however: \u201cAfter just a day or a couple of days,\u201d Lai said, \u201cthese effects fade away.\n\nThe idea of \u201cimplicit bias\u201d began to take off in American workplaces and society a decade ago, as corporations looked for alternatives to \u201cdiversity training,\u201d an $8 billion effort that has been largely unsuccessful. Studies have found that, rather than encouraging participants to embrace people of all colors and creeds, forced classes on diversity often backfire, making people more defensive and divided. Implicit bias, by contrast, is rooted in the idea that we all possess inherent prejudices. Instead of mandating employee training on racial sensitivity, diversity awareness, compliance with antidiscrimination laws, and lessons on how to better integrate the workplace, companies in recent years have spent millions of dollars on new programs that train employees to recognize their biases\u2014the idea being that if we can simply acknowledge our prejudices and blind spots, we can overcome them. Implicit bias trainings often involve videos, slideshows, or personal anecdotes that reveal how a person\u2019s individual biases may influence a particular situation. Approaches include talking through experiences, writing privately about racist feelings, watching videos of racist incidents, role-playing, listening to personal stories of discrimination, and learning lessons about history and policy.\n\nYet laboratory studies have shown that, like the diversity trainings, anti-bias initiatives may also be ineffective at combating racism. Some of the exercises probably do have an effect, Jeni Kubota said. The problem is \u201cthey only work for a little bit\u201d\u2014the same way the subjects in Calvin Lai\u2019s experiment were only able to dampen their biases temporarily. \u201cThen you go back out in the real world, you get reinfected with these associations, and any cognitive intervention that you did diminishes over time,\u201d Kubota said.\n\nThe problem with viewing racism in medical terms is that it confines racism to a disease in the body or mind, something biological that may be treated\u2014even cured\u2014without the need for larger societal changes. \u201cIt assumes we can just fix it with a pill or download screensavers of Denzel Washington and Lupita Nyong\u2019o and all of a sudden you will stop being racist\u2014a pain-free, recreational fix for what is hundreds of years of historically fraught problems,\u201d said Jonathan Kahn, a professor at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and the author of Race on the Brain: What Implicit Bias Gets Wrong About the Struggle for Racial Justice.\n\nThis is the frustrating reality of racism that science has illuminated. Much as we\u2019d like to believe that white supremacists exist on the radical fringe, and that what it will take to cure them is to reintegrate them into mainstream society, the truth is not so simple. Racism courses through mainstream society, too, lurking in the brains of people like Shannon Brown and her family. Similarly, corporate anti-bias trainings suggest a straightforward set of steps for alleviating prejudice. But the idea that bias is somehow \u201cinherent\u201d in all of us\u2014a fact of life, something normal and natural, which simply must be recognized and accepted\u2014is deeply unsatisfying. Why should we settle for a society in which racism is allowed to persist?\n\nNeuroscience has exposed the shortcomings of the current approaches to combating racism. But it has also revealed that curing hate is theoretically possible\u2014under the right circumstances, and with enough mental effort. And one day, science may figure out a simple \u201ccure.\u201d To that end, researchers have started to study the members of hate groups more closely, to try to understand whether extreme racism operates in the brain the same way bias in the general public does. Simi, one of the leading experts in this field, has spent the last 20 years studying neo-Nazis in order to understand their motivations and behavior.\n\nIn a pilot study this year, Simi and researchers at the brain development lab at the University of Nebraska used fMRI scans to compare five former white supremacists with nonextremists. The subjects viewed racially charged images, such as swastikas, Confederate flags, or images of people in interracial relationships. The brain scans revealed significant differences in neurological activity between the former white supremacists and the control group. \u201cSo it\u2019s not just a difference by random chance,\u201d Simi said. \u201cMost of the heightened activation was occurring in one part of the prefrontal cortex in particular,\u201d the region associated with regulating moral behavior.\n\nThe pilot study is too small to draw conclusions, and Simi is working to expand the research to include a larger pool of former white supremacists, current white power group members, and nonextremists. But Simi believes he is on the path to identifying exactly how extreme racism operates in the brain. It is slow, expensive, difficult work, but the impetus for it, Simi said, came from his interviews with former white supremacists, who would tell him, \u201cI try and try, and I just can\u2019t stop hating people.\u201d"

    "text": "The Associated Press is reporting that President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria crystallized during a December 14 phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. According to the news agency, the decision was \u201cmade hastily, without consulting his national security team or allies, and over strong objections from virtually everyone involved in the fight against the Islamic State group, according to U.S. and Turkish officials.\u201d\n\nOne of the surprising details of the report is that Erdogan himself was taken aback at how successful he was in convincing Trump on the Syrian matter. Before the phone call, the consensus position that the Trump administration had reached, backed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, was that Trump would tell Erdogan to back off from his threats to attack Kurdish forces in Syria.\n\nBut during the phone conversation, Trump threw away the script and agreed with his Turkish counterpart. As AP relates, Trump started by reiterating the message of backing off. But then a change occurred:\n\nErdogan, though, quickly put Trump on the defensive, reminding him that he had repeatedly said the only reason for U.S. troops to be in Syria was to defeat the Islamic State and that the group had been 99 percent defeated. \u201cWhy are you still there?\u201d the second official said Erdogan asked Trump, telling him that the Turks could deal with the remaining IS militants.\n\nTrump then posed Erdogan\u2019s question to his National Security Advisor John Bolton, who was participating in the phone call. Bolton admitted that the Islamic State had indeed lost 99 per cent of its territory but said that it was in America\u2019s interest to make sure the group did not enjoy a resurgence.\n\nTrump was not dissuaded, according to the officials, who said the president quickly capitulated by pledging to withdraw, shocking both Bolton and Erdogan. Caught off guard, Erdogan cautioned Trump against a hasty withdrawal, according to one official. While Turkey has made incursions into Syria in the past, it does not have the necessary forces mobilized on the border to move in and hold the large swaths of northeastern Syria where U.S. troops are positioned, the official said.\n\nFrom this reporting, it seems likely that it was never Erdogan\u2019s intention to get the United States to withdraw. Rather he made the demand as a bargaining move, to get other, lesser goals. Trump, displaying his mastery of the art of the deal, gave in to Erdogan\u2019s maximum position.\n\nThe White House denies the accuracy of AP\u2019s account."

    "text": "In propounding one of his most intuitively appealing theories, Marx asked, \u201cIn what, then, consists the alienation of labor?\u201d Alienation is the emotional state that takes place when capitalism divorces the worker from the product he creates. Because he does not \u201crealize himself in his work,\u201d the worker is only happy when he is not doing it: \u201cHe feels at home when he is not working, and when he is working he does not feel at home.\u201d This is obvious, for Marx, because nobody works when they don\u2019t have to. It is what makes working under capitalism a kind of forced labor.\n\nAlienation is the chief theme in Heike Geissler\u2019s 2014 book Seasonal Associate, published in the U.S. for the first time this December. The narrator, who is not named but strongly resembles Geissler, is a freelance writer and translator who has fallen on hard times (surprise, surprise). Squeezed by her financial precarity\u2014she has children and debt\u2014the narrator applies for a temporary job in an Amazon warehouse in Leipzig. She approaches her interview with a grinning resistance, disobeying a wall sign\u2019s command to use the handrail by the stairs, for example.\n\n\n\nSEASONAL ASSOCIATE by Heike Geissler. Semiotext(e) / Native Agents, 240pp., $13.99\n\nThat meager dose of autonomy dissolves once she gets the job. The book is written mostly in the second person, with our unnamed narrator addressing somebody as \u201cyou.\u201d The \u201cyou\u201d is ostensibly her former self, the worker-self who is in the Amazon warehouse, as opposed to the writer-self, who is \u201creal,\u201d looking back on these strange events. At the start of the worker-self\u2019s ordeal, the writer-self explains that, actually, you need this job. \u201cYou instantly grow ancient and wooden\u201d at this revelation. From this moment on, you are \u201cbeside yourself with worry,\u201d and the anxiety never abates.\n\nEmbedded into the very narrative structure of Seasonal Associate is Geissler\u2019s awareness that the laborer under capitalism, bereft of control, splits into multiple selves who are alienated from each other. Who is the \u201cI\u201d who works for Amazon, and why is she so quiet? Geissler presses down hard on the identity changes that take place inside the worker who does not see herself in her work, then sublimates that analysis into the texture of her account."

    "title": "The Burden of Proof in Sexual Assault",
    "authors": [
      "Benjamin Rachlin"
    ],
    "text": "It is not the first state to do so. Until the last half-century, states commonly required corroboration. \u201cThe law is well established,\u201d read a 1904 court ruling in Georgia, \u201cthat a man shall not be convicted of rape on the testimony of the woman alone, unless there are some concurrent circumstances which tend to corroborate her evidence.\u201d A 1959 law in New York, in the words of one historian, required corroboration of \u201ceach material element of the offense\u2014force, penetration, and identity of the accused.\u201d These and other statutes grew from a concern that jurors could be moved to sympathy by any description of so heinous an offense, no matter how specious\u2014and from misogyny, rather explicitly. \u201cWomen often falsely accuse men of sexual attacks to extort money, to force marriage, to satisfy a childish desire for notoriety, or to attain personal revenge,\u201d read a 1970 argument in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review. Two years later, in The Yale Law Journal, a contributor remarked, \u201cIt is generally believed that false accusations of sex crimes in general, and rape in particular, are much more common than untrue charges of other crimes,\u201d adding later, that \u201cthe dangers of unfounded rape charges are particularly common and dangerous when made by children.\u201d\n\nBy the 1980s, owing mainly to the women\u2019s rights movement and to a dawning awareness of the realities of sexual assault, a majority of such laws were repealed. Stephen Schulhofer, an expert in criminal justice at NYU Law School who specializes in sexual assault, told me, \u201cVictims can make false accusations of theft, robbery, fraud. The mere possibility of a false accusation doesn\u2019t generate these kinds of requirements anywhere else.\u201d Arbitrarily steepening the barriers to some criminal verdicts but not others can make legitimate convictions impossible, he said. \u201cWe have this philosophy that it\u2019s better for nine guilty people to go free than for one innocent person to be convicted. This is more like letting 999 guilty people go free.\u201d\n\nToday, 36 states and the federal government do not require corroborating evidence for a conviction of sexual assault. Neither does the Military Code of Justice or Guam or Puerto Rico. The remaining states do so only in limited circumstances. Mississippi requires corroboration if an alleged victim\u2019s testimony is \u201cdiscredited or contradicted by other credible evidence.\u201d* Missouri requires it if testimony is \u201cin conflict with physical facts, surrounding circumstances, and common experience.\u201d Arizona requires it if \u201cthe story is physically impossible or so incredible that no reasonable person could believe it.\u201d No state has a corroborative policy specific to children.\n\nNonetheless, the actual practice of criminal justice means that many victims of sexual assault do require evidence for their claims to be received seriously, since, well before persuading a jury, he or she must persuade officers and then a prosecutor. Joe Cherniske, who co-led the prosecution of Foad Afshar with Vartanian, told me that most cases brought forward by his office do include corroborating evidence, regardless of statutory requirements. The Gundersen National Child Protection Training Center, perhaps the foremost organization in America for investigating crimes against children, recommends the collection of such evidence, as studies show it increases the odds an allegation will result in formal charges and confessions. According to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, corroboration is helpful to \u201cavoid the normalization of victim blaming\u201d and for pursuit of sexual assault cases as more than \u201che said, she said.\u201d\n\nA wrinkle is that corroborating evidence is often unavailable. Or, rather, it depends on how one defines the term. A majority of sexual assaults are committed outside the view of potential witnesses. \u201cAnd a lot of these cases aren\u2019t reported right away,\u201d Cherniske said. \u201cThey don\u2019t get reported within that day or that week or that month. By the time we bring them into the hospital, there\u2019s not necessarily going to be physical evidence of trauma.\u201d Circumstances are especially difficult when the victim is a child. Because young victims are most often violated by adults they know and trust, even timely examinations seldom reveal signs of physical resistance, like torn clothing or bruises. An assault that does not include penetration\u2014only groping or fondling\u2014rarely leaves visible marks. According to the Department of Justice, as many as 40 percent of youth victims of sexual assault show no symptoms, and many do not report at all, frightened of retaliation from the abuser or from their parents.\n\nHowever, a wider array of evidence might be understood as corroborating, even psychological symptoms such as nightmares. \u201cThose who say there\u2019s no corroborating evidence are thinking very narrowly,\u201d Victor Vieth, the founder of the Gundersen center, told me. \u201cThey\u2019re thinking of hair, DNA, the things you see on television dramas. I\u2019ve never worked on a case of child abuse where, if you look hard enough, you won\u2019t find corroborating evidence.\u201d Vieth invited me to imagine a child who describes that his or her assault occurred in a room painted blue. Police should obtain a warrant and visit the room. Were its walls blue? If so, that was corroborating evidence.\n\nAs many as 40 percent of youth victims of sexual assault show no symptoms, and many do not report at all, frightened of retaliation from the abuser or from their parents.\n\nNo text of HB 106 clarified the term, and this was what Vartanian meant by murky. How were authorities to interpret corroboration? It would be difficult to overstate the magnitude of the decision. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that approximately one in six boys, and one in four girls, are sexually abused before they turn 18. In many states, laws governing the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of child abuse are named for the children whom adult authorities failed. Brooke\u2019s Law, in Vermont. Megan\u2019s Law, in New Jersey. The Jessica Lunsford Act, in Florida. The Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children Act. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act.\n\nI wondered whether, in Vartanian\u2019s view, the Afshar case included any corroborating evidence. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d E.R. was able to describe the interior of Afshar\u2019s office, including what furniture he sat on. \u201cAll that was corroborated and found during a search warrant. Dr. Afshar admitted that he used methods that our victim talked about.\u201d\n\nNeither of those was in dispute, I pointed out. Everyone, including Afshar, agreed the child and therapist had met for five appointments, four of them before the day in question. It stood to reason that E.R was able to describe the interior of the room. Everyone also agreed on what treatment methods the therapist was using, and that no credible application of them included any contact with genitals. I confessed it was difficult for me to see how either fact clarified the truth of what happened\u2014what, in a meaningful sense, they were corroborating.\n\nThat was a question for jurors to decide, Vartanian answered. And jurors had decided.\n\n\n\nIn late 2014, E.R. was nearing the end of his first semester of seventh grade, and his home life, he would later testify, \u201cwas a cesspool.\u201d He signed up for a program at the Boys & Girls Club. Enrollment required that he pass a physical, including, he believed, a genital exam. The prospect made him uneasy. \u201cI don\u2019t like when they put their hand down your pants or anything like that.\u201d He mentioned the physical to Afshar, who decided that, alongside E.R.\u2019s more abstract complaints\u2014turmoil at home, misbehavior at school\u2014this seemed like a specific, tangible treatment goal. Together they set about trying to address it.\n\nFirst Afshar suggested that E.R. ask his physician to examine him \u201cabove the clothes.\u201d This succeeded: According to the pediatrician\u2019s clinical notes, and to E.R\u2019s mother, who was present for the appointment, the pediatrician agreed his discomfort was typical for a boy E.R.\u2019s age, and the genital exam could be deferred until he was older. Next Afshar led E.R. through relaxation, visualization, and breathing exercises, and a technique called systematic desensitization. Gradually, Afshar would expose E.R. to triggers of his anxiety, to alleviate the stress they provoked. For a phobia of bees, a counselor might expose a patient to a buzzing sound, without any sting\u2014in this way, an anxiety could slowly be mollified.\n\nE.R. had named a phobia of genital exams. At their fifth appointment, after asking his permission, Afshar touched the boy\u2019s forearm. Then, according to Afshar, he instructed E.R. to touch his own belly, and to imagine that Afshar\u2019s hand was doing the touching. This was the nearest Afshar could get to the trigger of E.R.\u2019s anxiety, he later explained, without crossing an obvious boundary. According to E.R., something very different happened. Afshar reached beneath the boy\u2019s pants and underwear. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d E.R. later testified. \u201cI was in shock, so I just let it happen.\u201d\n\nA week passed uneventfully. Ten minutes before their next scheduled meeting, however, the boy told his sister what happened. Together the siblings told their father, who canceled the appointment. The following day, after a discussion between his parents, E.R.\u2019s mother phoned a guidance counselor at the middle school, who phoned the Department of Children, Youth, and Families, which contacted police.\n\nThe next afternoon, a pair of detectives knocked on the door of Afshar\u2019s office in Concord, interrupting a session with a patient. He asked if they could return later. (Afshar, who maintains his innocence, later said he assumed that someone in his family had died, and the detectives had come to notify him.) Over his shoulder, detectives noticed his patient was a child, and they pressed to speak immediately.\n\nAccording to E.R., Afshar reached beneath the boy\u2019s pants and underwear. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d E.R. later testified. \u201cI was in shock, so I just let it happen.\u201d\n\nWhen they asked if any patient had recently terminated counseling, Afshar said one had and, realizing they must mean E.R., said he thought he knew where a misunderstanding might have arisen. He explained the upcoming genital exam, the tangible goal, and the therapeutic techniques he\u2019d used. He demonstrated on one of the detectives. The detectives asked to see Afshar\u2019s clinical notes, but Afshar didn\u2019t have any: After intake and orientation, when Afshar filled out six pages of assessment forms and a mental status exam, he hadn\u2019t taken any further clinical notes in five weeks. Detectives left empty- handed. A day later, Afshar reconstructed his clinical notes on E.R. from memory. Four days after that, on January 20, detectives returned to his office with a search warrant. (A further complication existed, besides Afshar\u2019s note-taking habits. Due to what he attributed to disorganization on his part, in December 2014, his license lapsed with the New Hampshire Board of Mental Health Practice. He quickly realized the error and filed for renewal, but in the interim he continued his appointments. Two of his meetings with E.R., including the one in question, occurred while Afshar was practicing without a license.)\n\nThough detectives searched Afshar\u2019s office and computer, neither turned up anything incriminating or suspicious. Because eight days elapsed between the incident and its reporting to police, and because its description included no fluid or penetration, detectives decided it was unlikely that E.R.\u2019s pants or underwear would offer any evidence. They never collected or examined them for DNA or skin cells. At trial, an expert for the state confirmed that systematic desensitization was a \u201cgenerally accepted treatment method,\u201d especially for phobias, and was often paired with relaxation and breathing techniques, precisely as Afshar described. But it was also vital to take clinical notes, and to obtain informed consent from a parent, neither of which Afshar had done. A result was confusion. Although it turned out no genital exam was required after all, understandably E.R. did not know this in advance and, since he was the one communicating with his therapist, Afshar didn\u2019t know it, either. Meanwhile, E.R.\u2019s father knew of the upcoming exam, and mentioned it to Afshar, but offhandedly; he was only making conversation. He regarded the exam as separate from his son\u2019s behavioral issues. Sitting in the nearby waiting room, E.R.\u2019s father didn\u2019t know touch therapy was occurring at all.\n\nOne need pay only the barest attention to current events to recognize how often our culture has dismissed or belittled the victims of sexual assault, how seldom we have heard them.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that both police and prosecutors seemed unfamiliar with psychotherapy. At their initial interview inside his office, Afshar had told detectives he understood E.R. was in a bit of a \u201ctime crunch\u201d to deal with his phobia, because the genital exam was required to enroll at the Boys & Girls Club. Detectives mistook this as a therapeutic technique\u2014\u201ctime crunching,\u201d like visualization or hypnosis. The phrase made its way into their official report, and prosecutors raised it at trial. What was this time crunching? \u201cThere is no such thing as \u2018time crunching,\u2019\u201d Afshar testified. \u201cThat\u2019s the stupidest thing I ever read in that police report.\u201d\n\n\u201cI assume that you feel betrayed by [E.R.]?\u201d Cherniske asked.\n\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to you, he made all this up?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d Afshar said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he made it up, I don\u2019t know if other people made it up. I have no idea. I know the allegations are false. Totally, completely.\u201d\n\nE.R. was 14 by now. Like many 14-year-olds, he could be endearing: On the stand, when he told Vartanian he no longer hung around with the classmate with whom he was caught smoking, and she asked why, E.R. replied that he found the boy \u201cannoying.\u201d What made him say that? \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care what happens. Like, he doesn\u2019t respect anything.\u201d\n\nHe could also be funny. What was his sister like? Vartanian wondered. \u201cGrumpy.\u201d Was she ever not grumpy? \u201cA rare chance.\u201d\n\nAt times he could be conspicuously deflecting, as though he were coached. Was he aware that shoplifting was wrong? \u201cYeah.\u201d What had made him do it, then? \u201cPeer pressure, and I didn\u2019t want to not fit in. I felt nervous, like that if I didn\u2019t fit in, they would make fun of me and judge me.\u201d Had he wanted to do those things that got him into trouble? \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nAt times he could be achingly sympathetic, even as the reason aroused curiosity. Within days of his mother\u2019s testimony that her ex-husband\u2019s new girlfriend, whom E.R. disliked, made E.R. feel he was losing his father\u2019s attention, E.R. agreed on the stand that since reporting the assault everyone had been \u201ccomforting\u201d and \u201csympathetic\u201d toward him, and he had gotten a lot of \u201cpositive attention.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your mom and dad have been united in supporting you, like you had never seen them united before?\u201d Afshar\u2019s attorney asked.\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing, isn\u2019t it, for mom and dad to get along?\u201d\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, they get along better now than they have ever since they got divorced, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d E.R. said. \u201cThis is definitely the best in a long time.\u201d\n\nAlso like many 14-year-olds, E.R. was not always perfectly honest. \u201cHe lies a lot,\u201d his sister had told detectives, though she insisted he wasn\u2019t lying about this. At their last appointment, in fact, Afshar had confronted E.R. about two apparent lies. E.R. had told the counselor he was Facebook friends with someone who Afshar happened to know had no Facebook account. He also told the counselor he\u2019d never had a girlfriend. Then E.R.\u2019s father mentioned his son having recently broken up with one. In their session on January 6, 2015, Afshar asked E.R. about these inconsistencies. A week later, E.R. told his father he was groped.\n\nVartanian and Cherniske each told me, separately, that prosecutors routinely know more than circumstances permit them to introduce at trial, though both declined to say if this were true of the Afshar case specifically. In a file at the Merrimack County courthouse, I discovered a portion of what they might have been hinting at. Some of Afshar\u2019s supporters were publicizing that he had passed a pair of lie detector tests a court ruled inadmissible at trial. This was not entirely the truth. Actually it was detectives who invited Afshar to take a polygraph, during their visit to his office, and Afshar declined, saying\u2014according to detectives\u2019 notes\u2014that such exams were \u201cunreliable,\u201d and he felt \u201ctoo anxious\u201d for an accurate result. Eight days later, Afshar did take a polygraph, administered by a private provider, not police. He passed. His attorney showed the results to police, who concluded that the questions in the exam were too vague. So Afshar returned to the private provider, who rephrased his questions. Again Afshar passed; again the results were shared with police. This time, among several problems with the test, a departmental expert concluded that Afshar \u201cappeared to be using counter measures.\u201d Eventually both sides agreed to withhold any mention of polygraphs from trial. Afshar\u2019s two passing grades later became public knowledge. No other facts from the episode did.\n\nVartanian and Cherniske each told me that prosecutors routinely know more than circumstances permit them to introduce at trial, though both declined to say if this were true of the Afshar case specifically.\n\nIn the same file, I found a document that was never introduced in any motion or hearing. It was a letter of support from a patient who\u2019d met Afshar on and off for a decade, beginning when he was twelve, the same age as E.R. After reading it, detectives phoned him to follow up. \u201cHe said Dr. Afshar would massage his muscles all over his body, to include his back, shoulders, arms, and abdomen,\u201d detectives wrote in their notes. The patient, now a young man, suffered from irritable bowel syndrome, and he told them Afshar seemed \u201cknowledgeable.\u201d The counselor would \u201cmassage and push on his abdomen in order to increase circulation to his intestines to help his IBS.\u201d Sometimes this happened above the young man\u2019s clothes; sometimes it happened beneath them. \u201c[He] said Dr. Afshar sometimes pressed on his abdomen over his clothes below his \u2018belt line\u2019 but he denied that Dr. Afshar ever touched his genitals.\u201d\n\nThe courthouse file included the letter. \u201cNever have i felt uncomfortable by his touch in anyway nor do i believe it was in anyway meant to be sexual,\u201d the young man wrote. \u201cOne reason I have seen him for counseling is for my troubled ability to trust people and yet i still trust him completely. I hate to see how much good he does to selflessly help people being thrown away by these trying circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe list of organizations that opposed HB 106 included some unusual allies: the County Attorneys Association and the Department of Safety, but also the state chapter of the ACLU. A House committee determined the bill would leave the state \u201cwith the weakest sexual assault statute in the nation.\u201d A press release by the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence decried the proposal as \u201ca blueprint for how to get away with sexual assault,\u201d and announced it \u201cwould require either DNA evidence or an eyewitness,\u201d a claim that, while untrue, reflected the widespread confusion about what corroborating meant. A public hearing in February 2017 stretched nearly four hours when 120 people showed up. Reporters for New Hampshire Public Radio described attendees wearing stickers that read, I believe victims. Others wore different stickers: Justice for Foad. The bill proved so controversial that one of its co-sponsors later declined to discuss it with me at all; another withdrew her support and voted against it. \u201cIt was a major mistake,\u201d she told me. \u201cI really thought I was doing an OK thing. That bill was the hardest lesson I ever learned.\u201d At the end of 2017, the proposal was tabled indefinitely.\n\nStill, the original controversy persisted. If HB 106 was no answer, then what was? If certain ills plague any law that requires corroboration, others plague any case that proceeds without it. A case like this presents obstacles for everyone. For victims, it means no proof of their experience, and therefore their trauma is too often dismissed. For the accused, it means the absence of such proof does not reliably exculpate them. A defense attorney is tasked with countering what evidence prosecutors introduce. If this evidence consists solely of the word of the victim, then that is what he counters. An attorney for a client like Foad Afshar has little choice but to accuse an alleged victim like E.R., however politely, of lying. Wasn\u2019t this precisely the treatment victims were asking to avoid, especially in the present moment? An adult with a conscience need pay only the barest attention to current events to recognize how often our culture has dismissed or belittled the victims of sexual assault, how seldom we have heard them. Wasn\u2019t it vital to treat victims more decently, and didn\u2019t that mean believing them? But how far was it right to extend that principle\u2014and given the presumption of innocence, weren\u2019t our laws designed not to? Without evidence, what is the alternative?\n\nWasn\u2019t it vital to treat victims more decently, and didn\u2019t that mean believing them? But how far was it right to extend that principle\u2014and given the presumption of innocence, weren\u2019t our laws designed not to?\n\nWhen I mentioned these concerns to Jennifer Long, the CEO of AEquitas, a national resource for prosecutors of gender-based violence, she agreed the quandary I was noticing shaped many cases that lacked corroborating evidence. But it was also the underlying dynamic of any case of sexual assault, she said. \u201cAll you\u2019re doing is playing into what people believe already, to blame the victim. Challenging the veracity comes along with the court process.\u201d Or, as Joe Cherniske told me, \u201cThe premise of the prosecution of these cases, where there\u2019s no one else present for the crime, is that the victim has to be telling the truth. And the premise of the defense is that the victim is either confused, mistaken, or lying. I don\u2019t know how else they could go at it.\u201d\n\nAn additional frustration is that, with so many facts undisputed, each side is simply left to argue, in testimony and character witnesses, how best to interpret them. A trial with no evidence, or at least no conclusive evidence, yields no discoveries. Only inferences. Most of those who believed Afshar guilty assumed that more victims existed, though with none coming forward, and also statistics about underreporting, this was impossible to prove or disprove. The appearance of no other victims showed either that Afshar was a successful criminal or that he was an innocent man. For much of his career, Afshar treated the neediest of children, including those with disabilities or from broken homes. This showed that he was either predatory or altruistic. To clients and their parents, Afshar often gave his personal email address and cell phone number. This showed that he was either grooming or generous. Upon hearing the accusation against him, Afshar urged detectives to consider his reputation\u2014\u201cthat he had been in business for about 30 years, that nothing like this had ever come up before,\u201d one officer recalled. This showed that he was either credible or manipulative. E.R. had a recent history of misbehavior and dishonesty. This showed the boy was unreliable. Or else it revealed why Afshar had targeted him.\n\nBefore shuttering his practice, Afshar maintained a professional web site, and when detectives visited it, they noticed it \u201cgoes to great lengths to sell his qualifications and services to help children.\u201d This made sense for a therapist who worked primarily with the young. But another interpretation existed. The web site \u201cby itself does not imply pedophilic or criminal tendencies on his part,\u201d read a detective\u2019s supporting affidavit for a search warrant. \u201cBut it cannot be ignored that sexual predators that target children frequently choose careers which provide them with unsupervised access to children.\u201d The affidavit continued, \u201cHis self-described \u2018passion\u2019 for children\u2019s well-being, his obvious admiration of their world-view, and his hope that he does not lose his \u2018sense of childhood\u2019 all take on a sinister tone in this light. Although Dr. Afshar communicates noble intentions for his patients, it is noteworthy that the web site and its language are also consistent with a sexual predator attempting to lure additional child targets.\u201d\n\nIn her closing argument, Vartanian looked similarly to Afshar\u2019s credentials. \u201cHe expects you to believe him. It\u2019s clear that he\u2019s accustomed to that, people taking him at his word.\u201d When I spoke to her, she mentioned Jerry Sandusky and Larry Nassar, two convicted serial sexual assaulters, both of whom are in prison. How did those abusers continue for so long? \u201cPeople have a hard time with anyone who\u2019s in a position of authority, and had success, and has the respect of their community, believing that they could harm a child,\u201d she said. No parent wants to face the possibility of his or her own child in danger, so they simply refuse to believe it is possible. Vartanian, and several others I spoke with, are parents; they can understand this impulse, even sympathize with it. But they believe it is a form of denial. \u201cWe\u2019re all opposed to child abuse in the abstract,\u201d Victor Vieth told me. \u201cWe\u2019re seldom opposed to it when we see it up close and personal. And the reason for that is that it\u2019s someone we know.\u201d\n\nAfter Afshar\u2019s sentencing, some mental health care providers in New Hampshire reportedly began to change the way they provided treatment, out of fear that an unfounded accusation might destroy their livelihoods.\n\nAfter Afshar was convicted, a web site was set up, justiceforfoad.com, for people to contribute to his legal fund. (In all, more than $50,000 has been raised.) A newsletter sends updates on his case to subscribers. \u201cIt would not be unfair to compare these dynamics to those of the Salem witch trials,\u201d one read. Another included a letter from Afshar, from inside prison. \u201cI can\u2019t tell one day from another, and live in a space the size of a car parking space with no direct natural light and lots of noise\u2014just loud, incomprehensible, often violent, crude conversations intertwined with the clanging of heavy metal doors\u2026. I cope one hour at a time.\u201d Newspaper photographs during this period, from a mugshot and appearances at appeal hearings, show a paler, gaunter Afshar, in prison garb, with an unkempt beard and eyes downcast. These photographs became their own controversy, a reporter for the local newspaper, the Concord Monitor, told me, when readers began phoning to complain. \u201cThey said, \u2018You\u2019re making him look like a criminal. He\u2019s not a criminal.\u2019 What we would explain was, he had been convicted of this crime, and we need a photo of him to illustrate our story.\u201d\n\nA therapist often has no secretary or receptionist, no assistant or support staff. How are they to protect themselves, if they are innocent? After Afshar\u2019s sentencing, some mental health care providers in New Hampshire reportedly began to change the way they provided treatment, including video recording sessions, out of fear that an unfounded accusation might destroy their livelihoods. Others have ceased accepting into their treatment any child diagnosed with certain personality disorders, or whose family life seems adversarial, meaning a child whose parents are separated or divorced. In other words, precisely those children who might most need counseling. How many providers have altered their practice in response to Afshar, or whether they tally enough to seriously reduce treatment opportunities for children in the state, is uncertain. The community of therapists, like the community of sexual assault survivors, is not a monolith. Neither are those the only two constituencies with meaningful interests at stake. Nor is New Hampshire the only place. Every other state is in the same position.\n\nThe creator of justiceforfoad.com and the newsletter is a psychologist named Mike Kandle, who works from a home office in a hilly, wooded neighborhood in Durham, near the University of New Hampshire. For someone so outspoken about the vulnerability of his profession to unfounded allegations, he seemed to practice in a particularly vulnerable setting, I noticed. He agreed this was true. It was the first home office he\u2019d owned. He gestured toward a wall of large sliding glass doors, which, he maintained, made his office more \u201ctransparent.\u201d He said, \u201cI would\u2019ve recognized the client that put Foad in jail as a high-risk client, and I would have declined to take them altogether.\u201d\n\nEarly in his career, before moving to Durham, Kandle once worked with a twelve-year-old boy\u2014the same age as E.R., he noted. The boy\u2019s mother could be volatile, and, after one of her tirades at home, the boy confided to Kandle that he sometimes felt angry toward his mother and her treatment of him. At their next session, the woman appeared alone in Kandle\u2019s office. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about what\u2019s happening inside your office with my son,\u201d Kandle still recalled her saying. \u201cFor all I know, you could be molesting him.\u201d Her tone and expression left Kandle with little doubt what she meant. \u201cA warning shot over the bow,\u201d he told me.\n\nKandle long ago stopped seeing children from similar circumstances. When he learned of the allegation against Afshar, he assumed it was \u201cphony,\u201d since Afshar was \u201cwell known\u201d and \u201cwell admired.\u201d On the New Hampshire Psychological Association listserv he began posting his thoughts on the case. When leadership grew sensitive about this, Kandle invited anyone who was interested to email him for continued updates. The result was Kandle\u2019s ongoing newsletter. \u201cThe whole drama created a lot of anxiety and tension and conflict for our profession.\u201d\n\nI asked Kandle if he was troubled at all by what might be cast, generously, as Afshar\u2019s inattention to paperwork: the lapsed license, the absent clinical notes. Those were \u201cirresponsible\u201d and \u201ccareless practice,\u201d Kandle said. They were not criminal, however. Or unheard of. Professionals in his field, as in every field, sometimes grow busy and fall behind. Perhaps it warranted a complaint to the licensing board. Whether Afshar had molested a patient was an entirely different question, Kandle said. \u201cThose careless lapses on his part were used to augment the argument, in court, that this is an unethical, unprofessional, rogue, untrustworthy bad actor. It just defies credibility.\u201d\n\nThe episode made Kandle sympathetic to HB 106, and initially he submitted a letter in support. \u201cI just could not understand how allegations of this nature could be judged without any evidence whatsoever. Part of me thought it made sense to require some.\u201d Then he read and listened to counterarguments. These, too, he found persuasive. \u201cThese things take place in private,\u201d he said sadly. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for anyone to know what actually happened.\u201d If that mother, early in his career, had been determined? \u201cMy career would probably have been destroyed.\u201d On the other hand, certainly there were abusers out there. \u201cI don\u2019t have any wisdom in terms of how cases like this should be handled,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s beyond me. I see the problems. I see the controversy.\u201d\n\nA case like Afshar\u2019s appeared to stand at a vexing intersection\u2014a heinous offense, a common lack of evidence. Are the courts equipped to accommodate all these variables?\n\nWhat is the solution? A small number of models have emerged in recent years as substitutes for the criminal justice system, including civil litigation, mediation, and the restorative justice movement, but those are designed to resolve conflicts, not uncover truths. They are helpful only if a shared understanding exists that an offense occurred. I mentioned to Stephen Schulhofer that a case like Afshar\u2019s appeared to stand at a vexing intersection\u2014a heinous offense, a common lack of evidence. How equipped are the courts to accommodate these variables simultaneously? Schulhofer referred me to the famous line by Winston Churchill\u2014that democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others. \u201cWhat\u2019s the alternative?\u201d Then he answered his own question. \u201cHistory gives us some answers. We used to have trial by ordeal, or trial by battle. We used to tie people up and throw them in the water. If they floated, that meant their soul was hollow and they were guilty. If they sank, they were innocent, and they got a Christian burial. There are many alternatives. But you can see right away that they\u2019re even worse.\u201d An impartial jury, a unanimous verdict, a burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt\u2014these and other protections exist to balance competing priorities humanely. It was no surprise to Schulhofer that some cases laid those priorities bare. \u201cWe need to have a system for enforcing the law. At the same time, we don\u2019t want to put people behind bars if there\u2019s a chance they\u2019re innocent. In an organized society, that\u2019s an existential problem.\u201d\n\nIn September 2017, after publishing my first book\u2014which told, in part, a story of wrongful conviction\u2014I spoke with New Hampshire Public Radio. The next morning, Foad Afshar emailed me. \u201cIt touched my heart that someone would take the time, stay dogged and be dedicated to the welfare of a wrongly convicted man,\u201d it read. \u201cYour work was especially poignant to me because I too was wrongly accused and convicted.\u201d I knew of his case, but only barely; given all the controversy, on the phone I expected to hear desperation, but he sounded calm and reflective. Now I realized how long he\u2019d had, more than a year, to adjust to an abruptly changed life, regardless of its cause. I told him I held no assumption he was innocent. It was important to me that he knew. His reply surprised me. \u201cThat\u2019s reasonable,\u201d he said. \u201cI appreciate you telling me.\u201d He recognized he couldn\u2019t expect every stranger to believe him.\n\nI phoned E.R.\u2019s parents, who told me they preferred not to speak with a reporter, though not before his mother asked me if I knew of the web site for Afshar\u2019s supporters. \u201cIt\u2019s hard, as a parent, not to look at that,\u201d she said. I\u2019d reached her in a fallow period, when things had quieted for her family between court rulings, but she knew it wouldn\u2019t last. \u201cYou feel blindsided sometimes. Things feel settled, and then all of the sudden, boom.\u201d\n\nAfter the trial verdict, Afshar hired a new defense attorney, Ted Lothstein. Lothstein hired an investigator who found and interviewed the twelve jurors from the trial. Two of the twelve, the investigator discovered, were survivors of sexual assault. Neither had mentioned this fact before trial. They\u2019d been asked at least twice: once on a written questionnaire, again verbally during selection. One juror, a young woman, was assaulted in middle school. She had not disclosed her experience because it was \u201cprivate.\u201d Another, an older man, was assaulted by his babysitter as a boy. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself as a victim,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not my lifestyle. Therefore, the answers that I gave were true, to my knowledge.\u201d He\u2019d been elected the jury foreman.\n\nNo rule prohibits a juror from serving on a trial for a crime he or she has personally endured. (Amanda Grady Sexton, director of public affairs at the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, told me that, if a jury was meant to represent one\u2019s peers, the prevalence of sexual assault was a relevant fact. \u201cIf you take away people who have had a sexual assault in their life, you certainly don\u2019t have a jury of your peers. Because your peers have been sexually assaulted.\u201d) A requirement is simply that each juror be \u201cfair and impartial.\u201d In the view of Vartanian and Cherniske, both jurors still were; some vaguely phrased queries had simply confused them. The pair withheld out of misunderstanding, not dishonesty. This carried no suggestion of bias.\n\nLothstein\u2014and eventually an appellate judge\u2014disagreed. In March 2017, a court vacated Afshar\u2019s convictions and released him from prison. Prosecutors appealed that decision in April; another judge denied them in May. Prosecutors appealed to the New Hampshire Supreme Court in January 2018. In October, the court ruled against them.\n\nToday Afshar is free, but perhaps only temporarily. Merrimack County is entitled to re-prosecute him. Five days after the state Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of Afshar\u2019s verdict, Joe Cherniske announced the state would \u201cnot pursue a second trial at this time.\u201d This did not exclude pursuing one in the future. In New Hampshire, the statute of limitations for aggravated felonious sexual assault against a minor expires \u201cwithin 22 years of the victim\u2019s eighteenth birthday.\u201d The question on which the appeal succeeded was procedural. It does not address the essential matter of what happened. In this permanent uncertainty, a portion of New Hampshire residents believes Afshar guilty. A portion believes him innocent. Any further trial verdict or court ruling is likely to worsen division, not alleviate it. So is any legislative proposal.\n\nAfshar has three children. The two eldest, who are in their mid-twenties, told me that no legal outcome could make them feel vindicated. That was the wrong word. What they hoped to feel, both told me, separately and unaware the other had said it, was relief. The eldest, Lilly, happens to be a survivor of sexual assault. \u201cSo many people are,\u201d she said. One of her earliest memories is her father admonishing her for squashing bugs. \u201cHe would always tell us, \u2018Those bugs have families. They have kids. How would you feel if someone came and crushed you?\u2019 That\u2019s where I learned everything I believe in.\u201d She does not look forward to more court proceedings. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to feel confident and secure after what happened.\u201d This is an easy sentiment to appreciate, and also to imagine extending to others. E.R. has finished middle school and begun high school. In a retrial, he and his family would be forced to choose whether or not to testify again.\n\nI asked Mike Kandle to consider a terrible possibility. What if, tomorrow, another victim came forward, with a story similar to E.R.\u2019s? What would Kandle\u2019s reaction be?\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be shocked,\u201d Kandle said. \u201cI\u2019d be confused. And if it were a credible accusation, from a credible source, I\u2019d find it heartbreaking. I have no interest in protecting sexual abusers. I work with plenty of victims of sexual abuse. I\u2019m keenly aware of the indignities and harms of justice not being served for them. I would never support anybody where there are legitimate accusations, even if I was a friend of theirs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would there need to be, for it to be a credible claim?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d Kandle said, and he paused to think.\n\n*Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that Massachusetts required corroboration in sexual assault cases, if an alleged victim\u2019s testimony is \u201cdiscredited or contradicted by other credible evidence.\u201d It is actually Mississippi."

    "text": "That might be true. But economic hardship in the banlieues has a decisively racial dimension not faced by the white working class that initially started demonstrating in November. According to a much-cited 2015 study, a job applicant with a name perceived to be Muslim or North African is four times less likely to be hired than an applicant with a traditional French name.\n\nThe role of racism in perpetuating economic inequality has long been a source of division in debates over class struggle. This is particularly true in France, which likes to see itself as colorblind. Because racial statistics are banned, policies designed to address inequality, especially in urban areas, tend to ignore the impact of racial discrimination. The banlieues\u2019 involvement in the Yellow Vests protests, then, raises important questions about whether or not decades of economic resentment, coming to a head under Macron, could be the start of a true class-consciousness, without the racial divisions that generally put the white rural poor and non-white urban poor on opposing sides.\n\n\u201cSo many of my friends told me not to show up because the Yellow Vests were a far-right group,\u201d a 22-year-old Muslim woman who marched with Justice for Adama, but asked to remain anonymous, told me on Saturday. \u201cBut that\u2019s a total lie\u2014look around! It\u2019s the media\u2019s way to discredit the movement,\u201d she said. She was marching alongside Mamadou Camara, 34, whose brother, Gaye, was killed by the police in January. \u201cWe saw that the racists are in the minority, and we know that this can\u2019t take place without us,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to show up, we can\u2019t just stay in our neighborhoods and not speak out.\u201d\n\nAlthough the question of police brutality might seem distant from the Yellow Vests\u2019 initial, predominantly economic list of demands, the robust police response to the past four weeks of protest has brought the issue forward. Earlier this month, an 80-year-old woman in Marseille died after being hit with a tear-gas canister. On Saturday, two journalists were injured after police fired Flash-Balls at the crowd; 8,000 police officers were deployed in Paris on Saturday\u201489,000 nationwide\u2014using teargas indiscriminately, more as a means to disperse crowds than as a response to violent provocations from demonstrators. Last week, as protests spread to high schools, footage of police forcing a group of students in Mantes-la-Jolie, a Paris suburb, to kneel with their hands above their heads prompted outcry.\n\nFor Camara, the current uprising creates an opportunity to show that those moments\u2014perhaps seen by the general population as exceptional, tied only to the current chaos\u2014\u201care the daily reality in the banlieues.\u201d\n\n\u00c9douard Louis, a prolific and internationally known young French author who has written extensively about the perils of rural poverty, expressed similar optimism that the Yellow Vests could open new avenues for cooperation between the urban and rural poor. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing people who have been excluded from traditional social movements, we\u2019re hearing the voices that we typically don\u2019t hear,\u201d he told me on Saturday. Contrary to standard practice in French protest movements, he stressed, influential unions have not played a role.\n\nLouis, who grew up in rural France, marched with Justice for Adama\u2014which is named after Adama Traor\u00e9, a 24-year-old black man killed by police in 2016\u2014on Saturday. The convergence of grievances against Macron, he argued, could create dialogue between left and right, urban and rural, to show that far-right xenophobia\u2014as a reaction to economic hardship\u2014is misplaced. \u201cBehind the far right are people who suffer, whose livelihoods are precarious, and who struggle to find the language to explain why,\u201d he told me.\n\nBut while opposition to Macron drew otherwise distant populations to the same streets on Saturday, that common outrage has yet to translate to collective action. Reports from the demonstrations showed protesters denouncing not just Macron\u2019s economic reforms but relaying right-wing misinformation about the Marrakech Pact, a global deal on migration.\n\n\u201cPolitically, I\u2019m not sure that it will be very effective,\u201d Nacira Gu\u00e9nif, a sociologist at Paris 8 University, said of the temporary alliance. \u201cOn the one hand it\u2019s interesting that Macron crystallizes all kinds of anger, but that\u2019s exactly why the agendas\u2014if we can identify any\u2014are very difficult to bring together.\u201d\n\nFor Louis, that only confirms the need for the groups on the left\u2014and from the banlieues\u2014to assert themselves, even if it means \u201ccreating a movement within the movement\u201d to \u201cwin the war of words.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are always searching for ways to explain why they suffer,\u201d he told me. \u201cDo they suffer because of migrants, because of minorities? Or do they suffer because of capitalism, because of the violence of our governments, because of the violence of Macron?\u201d For some of the banlieue activists, at least, these Yellow Vest protests offer hope that, finally, right-leaning rural voters will decide that it\u2019s the latter."

    "title": "The Criminal-Justice Reform Bill Is Both Historic and Disappointing",
    "authors": [
      "Matt Ford"
    ],
    "text": "One of the bill\u2019s central provisions expands what\u2019s known as the \u201csafety valve,\u201d which allows federal judges to ignore mandatory minimums in sentencing defendants who commit nonviolent, low-level crimes. Another provision reworks the three-strikes requirement for drug-related felonies: Instead of a life sentence, someone sentenced under it would receive only 25 years in prison. Modest though these changes are, they would not apply retroactively.\n\nThe bill\u2019s reforms for already incarcerated people are slightly more forceful. One provision would allow eligible federal prisoners to claim an extra seven days of credit for good behavior each year. This change would apply retroactively, bringing thousands of current inmates even closer to release. The First Step Act would also continue a program established in 2007 to help move elderly and terminally ill prisoners into home confinement. It would also require the Bureau of Prisons to tabulate how many prisoners are granted compassionate release, so lawmakers can insure the agency isn\u2019t refusing to apply it.\n\nLiberals may find some of the central provisions to be insufficient to the overall challenge of mass incarceration. Part of this can be attributed to the federal government\u2019s modest role in criminal justice; the overwhelming majority of American prisoners are tried, sentenced, and incarcerated by the states. That should not diminish the bill\u2019s potential impact for each individual person it would help. Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a nonprofit organization that advocates for sentencing and prison reforms, estimated in November that the First Step Act would affect 183,000 federal prisoners.\n\nThe First Step Act also avoids some of the pitfalls that limited progressive support for previous attempts at compromise legislation. For instance, conservative groups and Republican senators had previously argued in favor of imposing a default requirement for federal prosecutors to prove a defendant acted with criminal intent, or mens rea. But key Democratic senators strongly resisted the proposal, fearing that it would be used by corporations to evade punishment for environmental and regulatory crimes, and refused to vote for a bill that included it. The battle over mens-rea reform ultimately contributed to the failure of a criminal-justice reform package in 2016.\n\nOther portions of the bill will give force to long-overdue reforms. The Bureau of Prisons would be required to provide female prisoners with sanitary supplies like tampons, free of charge. Prison officials would be forbidden from using restraints on pregnant women before, during, and shortly after they give birth. Prisoners classified as \u201clower risk\u201d would be required to be placed in a form of home confinement. Those who are released would be given their birth certificate and a photo ID upon release. In his analysis of the bill, the Marshall Project\u2019s Justin George noted that many of these provisions are already required under policies that the Bureau of Prisons has been slow or reluctant to implement."

    "text": "Though the Trump Organization has promised that all profits received from foreign governments at these properties will be donated to the Treasury, ethics experts dispute the methods used for calculating these profits, suggesting that the president continues to profit from foreign spending. Several of Trump\u2019s most influential backers\u2013such as Broidy or the investor Tom Barrack\u2014also profit handsomely from business ties and interests in the Gulf States.\n\nThe secrecy surrounding Trump\u2019s financial affairs makes it difficult to know exactly how extensive these ties are. During the firestorm following Khashoggi\u2019s death, Trump tweeted that he had no financial interests in Saudi Arabia. As various journalists noted, the statement could be technically true\u2014in other words, no investments physically located within the country\u2019s boundaries\u2014while still misleading, given the Trump hotels\u2019 many Saudi customers. And as always, Trump\u2019s family members further complicate the picture. Over the last few years, for example, the Kushner family\u2019s attempts to refinance or sell their disastrous New York real estate holdings included a failed attempt to secure funding from Qatar\u2013a fact that\u2019s hard not to see as relevant when evaluating Kushner\u2019s unusual hostility toward Doha.\n\nTo be sure, money is not the only thing that ties the Trump administration so closely to the Gulf states. As with any administration, personality plays a role. The Saudis gave Trump the red-carpet treatment during his trip to Riyadh last year, a key element in winning over the mercurial president. Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, has reportedly built a friendship with Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nMoreover, there is some genuine policy affinity between the two sides. From Michael Flynn to John Bolton, the Trump administration has been replete with the kind of Iran hawks that delight policymakers in the Gulf. Meanwhile, the administration\u2019s notoriously pro-Israel and pro-Likud stance has been helpful as the Gulf states try to build a stronger regional partnership with Israel against Iran.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Mueller\u2019s investigation will untangle the web of money tying the Trump administration to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But the network has clearly produced dividends: an administration that is almost reflexively supportive of every key Saudi foreign policy priority.\n\nTake Iran, where Trump has withdrawn the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, reimposed sanctions and cracked down on U.S. allies in Europe and Asia. His decision to end the nuclear deal was opposed by other U.S. allies, China, Russia, most arms-control and regional specialists, and even his own secretary of defense and secretary of state; it was, however, supported by Saudi and Emirati leaders, who oppose Iran\u2019s regional influence, and were willing to fill the gap by boosting their own production in response to sanctions on Iranian oil.\n\nThe president also idiosyncratically backed Saudi interests during the Gulf Cooperation Council crisis which broke out in 2017. As Saudi Arabia and the UAE blockaded Qatar, Trump tweeted his strong support. Again, administration officials like Defense Secretary James Mattis\u2013likely mindful of the thousands of U.S. troops currently stationed inside Qatar\u2013opposed the blockade, and sought to mediate an end to the crisis. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson even intervened to try to prevent a Saudi invasion of Qatar. Leaked emails later suggested that for his trouble, both the Emiratis and the Saudis used their influence with the president (and with Kushner) to have him fired.\n\nThe administration has displayed unwavering support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, an ongoing humanitarian disaster. It continues to arm and aid the Saudi-led coalition, despite repeated reports of Saudi war crimes. Even the recent decision to end refueling support for the campaign came only after sustained congressional and public pressure, and the threat of a congressional rebuke on the topic. Indeed, the administration has actively worked with congressional leadership to shut down bills that would end U.S. support for the conflict.\n\nArms sales are another area where the Gulf States have benefited during the Trump administration. Though the president himself likes to portray such sales as vital to the United States economy, the actual financial and job-related benefits are small. Instead, these sales are hugely beneficial to the Saudi government, allowing them access advanced weapons and to replenish armament stocks. Recent reports suggest that Kushner even pushed to inflate the reported value of arms sales to the Kingdom in order to further bolster the partnership.\n\nPerhaps the most striking indication of the administration\u2019s excessive willingness to bend to Saudi interests is in its refusal to criticize the murder of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and U.S. resident killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. In any other administration, this action would have drawn clear condemnation and policy response. In the Trump era, the administration has displayed skepticism towards its own intelligence agencies, while maintaining its support for Saudi leaders.\n\nTo what extent were any of these decisions the direct result of money and influence from the Gulf States? It\u2019s impossible to say. For starters, we may never know the extent of the financial ties between Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Trump\u2019s businesses, family, and donors. Though Mueller\u2019s report may eventually clarify some of these questions, much of it lies outside the expected scope of the investigation. It\u2019s unclear whether other lawsuits\u2014such as one targeting Trump\u2019s businesses as violating the emoluments clause of the constitution\u2014will be successful in subpoenaing records on this question.\n\nMore importantly, though, it\u2019s difficult to distinguish influence during the Trump administration from general attempts by these states to buy policymaking influence here in D.C. As a recent report from the Center for International Policy (CIP) illustrated, Saudi lobbying in Washington has grown exponentially in recent years, costing $27.3 million in 2017 alone. In addition to the money that goes to traditional lobbyists, Saudi funding goes to think tanks, universities, and other institutions which can influence U.S. foreign policy.\n\nDespite rules on foreign election funding, at least some of that money even goes to politicians: The CIP report suggests that more than one-third of the congressmen contacted by lobbying firms like the Glover Park Group or DLA Piper on behalf of Saudi Arabia later received a campaign contribution from a registered foreign agent at the firm\u2014in other words, a U.S. citizen, but one paid by a foreign government. As the report notes, \u201cwhile it\u2019s true that foreign nationals are prohibited from making contributions to political campaigns, there\u2019s a simple work-around, one the Saudis obviously made use of big time \u2026 just hire a local lobbyist to do it for them.\u201d\n\nThe presence of this foreign money sloshing around in Washington raises serious concerns for the independence of U.S. foreign policy. Even in the absence of a clear quid pro quo, the Trump family benefits financially from its ties to the Gulf states. Adam Schiff, incoming chair of the House Intelligence Committee, has promised to probe these ties, though it\u2019s likely impossible to tell the extent to which money\u2014rather than personal factors or policy agreement\u2014is driving Trump\u2019s foreign policy decisions.\n\nNo one, however, can deny that money plays a role. Even as Mueller finishes his work, therefore, one thing is already clear: It\u2019s not just Russian meddling in U.S. foreign policy that we should be concerned about."

    "text": "Soft collusion would be cooperation between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign without an explicit quid pro quo. The Russians had plenty of quid to offer: promises of damaging information about Hillary Clinton, troves of stolen emails from her campaign chairman and the Democratic National Committee, the prospect of a lucrative real-estate deal in Moscow, and surreptitious assistance in winning the presidency of the United States. They also made their quo abundantly clear. Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who took part in the infamous Trump Tower meeting in the summer of 2016, previously worked on lobbying against U.S. sanctions against top Russian oligarchs. Donald Trump Jr. told investigators that the meeting went nowhere because Veselnitskaya only talked about Russian adoptions.\n\nTrump himself repeatedly signaled his willingness throughout 2015 and 2016 to favor Russian interests if elected. He repeatedly criticized NATO as \u201cobsolete,\u201d questioned whether Putin was actually responsible for the murders of Russian journalists, and frequently asserted that he would get along well with the Russian president. On July 27, he publicly welcomed Moscow\u2019s use of Clinton\u2019s emails for partisan gain during a televised press conference. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d he said, referring to emails deleted from the former secretary of state\u2019s private email server.\n\nRare is the person who didn\u2019t have strange contacts with Russian figures during the campaign. Mueller\u2019s filings indicate that Manafort\u2019s plea agreement fell apart because the political operative kept lying about his contacts with his associate Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian political consultant believed to have strong ties with his country\u2019s intelligence agencies. Roger Stone, a longtime Republican political operative, is under intense scrutiny for his efforts to forge communications with Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder who published stolen Democratic emails. There were Flynn\u2019s communications with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak after the Obama administration imposed sanctions, as well as Jared Kushner\u2019s request for Kislyak to set up a secret backchannel to Moscow. Even George Papadopoulos, an otherwise unremarkable foreign-policy aide, received entreaties from a mysterious British-based professor with Russian ties who offered dirt on Clinton.\n\nWith all these interactions, it would almost be strange if some form of implicit arrangement wasn\u2019t struck: You guys throw a few good jabs at Clinton, we\u2019ll take another look at those sanctions if we win and pick out carpets for the Trump Tower Moscow if we lose. (The Trump Organization will even throw in a swanky $50 million penthouse if everything works out.) Some observers believe that Mueller will conclude his investigation with a lengthy report summarizing his findings. Others think he\u2019s essentially been releasing that report in bits and pieces through the indictments and court filings he\u2019s already made public. But whatever form it takes, soft collusion looks like the floor for whatever he\u2019s found.\n\nSo what\u2019s the ceiling? Hard collusion\u2014some kind of explicit agreement between the Trump campaign and the Russian government\u2014would be trickier to prove, but still possible. Flynn received a lenient sentencing recommendation from Mueller earlier this month for his extensive cooperation with the investigation, none of which has made it into indictments or plea agreements anywhere else. As a top member of the Trump campaign, he would be well-positioned to discuss its inner workings. He would also be able to describe Trump\u2019s involvement in the phone call with Kislyak that ultimately ended Flynn\u2019s national-security career.\n\nMueller\u2019s filings on Friday also describe a November 2015 interaction between Cohen and an unnamed Russian national who said they could provide \u201cpolitical synergy\u201d and \u201csynergy on a government level\u201d with the Trump campaign. The unnamed figure also offered to set up a meeting between Trump and Putin and made references about Putin\u2019s potential endorsement of the Moscow Project. Mueller told the court that Cohen didn\u2019t pursue the relationship because he was working with someone, presumably Felix Sater, who already had connections with the Russian government.\n\nThose connections may be one of the reasons why the special counsel asked for some leniency toward Cohen. \u201cCohen provided the [special counsel\u2019s office] with useful information concerning certain discrete Russia-related matters core to its investigation that he obtained by virtue of his regular contact with Company executives during the campaign,\u201d Mueller\u2019s filing states. The sentence is a fascinating combination of vagueness and specificity. \u201cCertain discrete Russia-related matters core to its investigation\u201d may turn out to be the world\u2019s longest synonym for collusion. \u201cCompany executives,\u201d on the other hand, could be almost anyone within the Trump Organization\u2019s upper ranks, including the president\u2019s eldest children or even Trump himself.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Trump remained blissfully unaware of the extent of communications between his subordinates and a web of shadowy Russian figures. His reality-TV persona aside, the president isn\u2019t really known as a hands-on manager or a stickler for details. If there\u2019s evidence of hard collusion, however, and if Mueller can trace it directly to the president, he could be in legal jeopardy. One possible charge would be conspiracy to defraud the United States, the same charge that Mueller slapped on thirteen Russian intelligence operatives in February for making political expenditures to influence the election as foreign nationals.\n\nAmerican presidents haven\u2019t typically had to worry about facing criminal charges when leaving office. For better or for worse, there\u2019s a strong norm against prosecuting former political opponents. Proponents rightly point out that going after one\u2019s political adversaries risks destabilizing a democratic political system by turning every election into a battle for control of the nation\u2019s prosecutorial powers. Critics note that the norm can also prevent accountability for genuine wrongdoing by high-level officials, such as when the Obama administration declined to pursue charges against Bush-era officials for torture.\n\nNo figure in modern American politics, however, has so stupendously forfeited the right to invoke this norm as Donald Trump. The president rose to power while claiming he would prosecute Clinton for vague, unspecified crimes while his supporters chanted \u201cLock her up!\u201d at rallies. During the second presidential debate in 2016, he threatened to throw her in jail if elected. Trump reportedly tried to make good on his pledge by ordering the Justice Department to prosecute her and Comey earlier this year, only to be rebuffed by then-White House Counsel Don McGahn. Prosecuting an ex-president is a hard, dangerous decision. In an ironic twist for the ages, however, nobody has made it easier than Trump himself."

    "text": "Rusbridger developed his vision for digital journalism outside the traditional constraints of corporate governance schemes. The Guardian, where he was named Editor in 1995, had long been owned by the Scott Trust, an umbrella organization formed by previous proprietors to support its costly, progressive journalism through other ventures. Between 2007 and 2014, the Trust sold its stake in the highly profitable car magazine Auto Trader to contribute to an endowment for The Guardian topping $1 billion in value.\n\nWith this measure of financial flexibility, The Guardian pushed ahead into the digital world. As many national and international competitors tepidly replicated their print products as static websites, The Guardian attempted to tap into its readership as a resource through new story formats and proactive engagement, all while pushing out investigative work like its reports on phone hacking. News outlets\u2019 audiences also had the ability to publish information in comments sections, message boards, and blogs. \u201cFor 200 years journalism had been about pushing stuff out at readers,\u201d Rusbridger writes. \u201cAnd now.\u2026 Here were real live readers\u2014sometimes thousands of them\u2014responding instantly to things you were telling them.\u201d\n\nRusbridger sought to harness this through what he calls \u201copen journalism\u201d\u2014reporting that actively encourages audience participation, prizes transparency in its processes, and updates readers with new information from outside sources. The philosophy was particularly appealing to American liberals who felt misled by the press in wake of September 11, and The Guardian began racking up global readership that would come to rival that of The New York Times and Washington Post. While such massive digital audiences did not initially prove lucrative, Rusbridger and most others assumed that advertisers would eventually follow as they had previously.\n\nThis emphasis on maximizing reach incentivized news outlets to cover subjects with as wide an appeal as possible. Reporting on national politics or Hollywood news would bring in more readers, the thinking went, than reporting on municipal governments or local culture. Digital startups like BuzzFeed structured themselves around the notion that made-for-virality content distributed on social platforms could pay for more substantial journalism and keep it free for readers. Many newspaper and magazine companies also followed this gospel, chasing fleeting clicks that often diluted core coverage of their communities.\n\nThe Guardian had considered charging digital readers for content as early as 1996, but Rusbridger had long pushed back on the notion: \u201cWe were coming to believe we had to work out how journalism was best done in the twenty-first century before retreating to the apparent safety of nineteenth-century payment models (which might not, in any event, work for everyone now).\u201d A paywall would supposedly confine high-quality news to a relative handful of elites, thereby limiting journalism in the public interest. \u201cIf legacy businesses were going to insist on revenues before reach they would lose every time,\u201d Rusbridger writes. \u201cThat was the theory.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian\u2019s American invasion, which culminated with the launch of Guardian US in 2011, proved a thrilling contrast to the agonizing retrenchment elsewhere in the media industry. It was one of five global news outlets that partnered with WikiLeaks in 2010 to publish classified cables exposing the dark underbelly of international diplomacy. A young National Security Agency contractor, Edward Snowden, approached it a few years later to share documents revealing the U.S. government\u2019s global surveillance apparatus. The reporting would go on to share the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service with The Washington Post in 2014.\n\nIn Rusbridger\u2019s mind, the Snowden revelation \u201cdemonstrates \u2026 why the institutional strength and independence of the press is so imperative.\u201d Such stories would be impossible without costly legal defenses and other in-house safeguards against government interference. They also require analytically-minded journalists to judge what information is in the public interest, especially as the \u201cpublic\u201d to which news outlets speak appears increasingly balkanized on the internet.\n\nDespite all the validation for its journalism, The Guardian burned through tens of millions of dollars in cash annually. And while the paper had counted on growing ad revenue to offset its costs, many companies now preferred to advertise directly on social platforms, where they could hone in on highly targeted groups of potential customers. Rusbridger characterizes the financial turmoil of his final days as editor with no small measure of understatement: \u201cI had stepped down at the end of May 2015 with the commercial board pronouncing themselves pleased with the shape the company was in.\u201d But mounting losses were so great that they began to take substantial bites out of the paper\u2019s endowment, requiring his successor, Katharine Viner, to slash costs by about 20 percent, including deep cutbacks at The Guardian\u2019s burgeoning US office.\n\nThe Guardian has stuck with its ideal of open journalism by enticing some readers to pay without forcefully excluding those who don\u2019t. Viner announced last month that 1 million people worldwide have voluntarily supported The Guardian over the past three years. Results from the fiscal year that ended in June suggest that more than half of them are regularly donating members, including upward of 70,000 in the United States. The endowment has stabilized, revenue is on a slight uptick, and Viner hopes to break even by next spring. But survival for this would-be flagship for progressive news hinged on tempering global ambitions just at the moment when its mission might have been most urgent, as liberal democracy teetered in countries across the world.\n\nElsewhere, the march toward a world with less news continues. Many digital publishers remain beholden to Facebook, Google, and other tech firms for page views, even while they report that those same companies\u2019 algorithms reward fake news. With Silicon Valley holding the keys to online and on-demand video, cable and broadcast news will likely face a similar moment of reckoning as their TV viewers age out. A few elite American publications took an exit ramp from this highway to oblivion by launching paywalls: The New York Times; The Washington Post; and other prestige or hyper-focused brands among them. It\u2019s likely that those in the middle of this continuum\u2014local newspapers and other outlets that have made important contributions\u2014will continue to fade away. The bifurcation has in some ways begun to resemble the dystopian media world of haves and have-nots that Rusbridger fears.\n\nThe Guardian remains unique among these English-language media in its ownership, mission, and model. In this sense, it\u2019s no surprise that Breaking News is descriptive of structural problems rather than prescriptive in how to respond. Rusbridger concludes by throwing up his hands and putting the onus on tech giants to help save journalism. \u201cThe question now is how will it be sustained in the age of the hyperglobal corporation: the untaxed, rootless entities that know more about us than our own mothers,\u201d Rusbridger writes. \u201cWill they destroy, or support, a critical, independent, professional cadre of people and news outlets that\u2014at their best\u2014perform an ever-more necessary public service?\u201d\n\nTo answer this question would require Facebook and other Silicon Valley giants not only to acknowledge that they make editorial decisions, but to accept a form of responsibility for the public interest. They could just as easily snuff out what\u2019s left of journalism. In that world, a gated community may be preferable to no community at all."

    "text": "There\u2019s limited evidence that a recession would doom Trump. A sitting president hasn\u2019t run for reelection in the midst of a recession since Jimmy Carter in 1980, as CNBC\u2019s John Harwood pointed out on Thursday. Carter, of course, lost in historic fashion, with Ronald Reagan taking 44 of 50 states in the Electoral College. Other recent presidents who saw recessions in their first term\u2014Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan, George W. Bush\u2014survived, though those recessions had all ended by election day, Harwood noted.\n\nBut there is reason to fear a recession. The economic recovery has been unusually long\u2014the second-longest expansion in U.S. history, after 1991-2001. Last year\u2019s enormous corporate tax cuts provided a shot in the arm for the economy, but its effects are wearing off as warning signs mount. \u201cA strong dollar, weaker growth abroad, mounting corporate debt, a slowdown in housing and the ongoing havoc that tariffs are wreaking on global supply chains are each taking a toll,\u201d wrote Diane Swonk, chief economist for Grant Thornton LLP. \u201cNo one knows for sure which straw will break the camel\u2019s back, only that they are piling up.\u201d\n\nTrump would certainly own any recession that occurred in the next few years. His economic protectionism has spooked global markets and damaged relationships with key allies and trading partners. The administration\u2019s weak-dollar policies and financial regulatory rollbacks would also be blamed for making any economic slowdown worse. But being responsible for something and being punished for it politically are two different things.\n\nThe economic indicators heading into the 2016 election suggested that Trump should lose. The economy, taken broadly, was doing quite well under Democratic leadership and Hillary Clinton had pledged to largely continue President Barack Obama\u2019s economic policies. Polls suggested that the majority of people felt good about the economy and their place in it. But Trump, who consistently painted a bleak and inaccurate picture of the economy under Obama, prevailed nevertheless.\n\nOf course, Trump won partly by appealing to people who had been left behind by the economic recovery. As the economy has continued to grow, though, Trump\u2019s approval rating has remained in the low 40s. A Quinnipiac poll released late last month revealed that 53 percent of voters approved of Trump\u2019s handling of the economy, but only 41 percent approved of Trump overall. The last few years have revealed that there are partisan correlations on economic polling\u2014Republicans tend to think the economy is doing well when a Republican is in office, and vice versa\u2014but these are still staggering numbers, given the aggregate economic numbers."

The Mueller investigation is mentioned but President Donald Trump goes unnamed.\n\nThe statement asks that the Senate defend democracy but that could mean anything. Supporters of Trump could believe they are defending democracy by protecting the president from what they see as Mueller\u2019s witch hunt.\n\nAs Susan Hennessey of the Brookings Institution notes:\n\n\n\n\n\n44 former senators heroically joining together to remind the current guardians of democracy of their oaths while avoiding saying the word \"Trump\" or offering even a whisper of concrete criticism. https://t.co/MBrgPNN3JE \u2014 Susan Hennessey (@Susan_Hennessey) December 11, 2018\n\nBecause the statement amounts to a nothing more than a collection of patriotic bromides, it is also ineptly composed. Consider this sentence: \u201cIt is a time, like other critical junctures in our history, when our nation must engage at every level with strategic precision and the hand of both the president and the Senate.\u201d It\u2019s difficult to figure out what this might mean. Jello has more solidity and fog more clarity of shape.\n\nEqually vacuous is this line: \u201cWe are at an inflection point in which the foundational principles of our democracy and our national security interests are at stake, and the rule of law and the ability of our institutions to function freely and independently must be upheld.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that America is facing a constitutional crisis that will test its institutions. But that nature of the crisis can only be confronted if it is named: There is accumulating evidence that President Donald Trump has committed crimes that warrant impeachment.\n\nThe fact that many members of the political elite, including even former senators, can\u2019t bring themselves to be blunt about this matter is itself part of the problem."

The new production\u2019s name comes from a Ghanaian proverb: \u201cThe head and the load are the troubles of the neck.\u201d It is a work of historical investigation and reclamation, focused on the African carriers and porters\u2014two million of them\u2014who lugged around the possessions of British, French, and German forces during World War One.\n\nAs with the best of Kentridge\u2019s work, The Head and the Load is a kaleidoscopic affair. There are numerous collaborators: The music was composed by Philip Miller and Thuthuka Sibisi and played by the Brooklyn ensemble The Knights, while the long list of extraordinary performers include Ann Masina, Nhlanhla Mahlangu, and N\u2019Faly Kouyat\u00e9. The production itself is a collage of many media, embodying our patchwork understanding of history itself.\n\nWe hear the famous letter from the Reverend John Chilembwe, who wrote a stinging open letter against the recruitment of Nyasa men into World War I, asking, \u201cWill there be any good prospects for the natives after ... the war?\u201d We hear snippets of military drills, Morse code, dogs barking, Frantz Fanon translated into siSwati. The words are both literary (e.g. Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire) and historical, such as the lines taken from the fatal Berlin conference of 1884, in which European powers divided the continent between themselves. The music, too, is a mixture, both an homage to traditional African music and the European avant-garde European (Schoenberg, Paul Hindemith)."

A key conduit for this activity is the Israeli security consulting firm Mer Security and Communication Systems, which was paid $8 million by the Democratic Republic of Congo to lobby against sanctions. Congo is facing sanctions because of the human rights abuses of the nation\u2019s president, Joseph Kabila.\n\nMer dispersed large payments to many Trump cronies and associates. As The New York Times reports:\n\nOne of Mer\u2019s great successes was an event promoting Congo at the Hay-Adams hotel in July, which was attended by Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani. As the Times notes, \u201cMer also agreed to pay $1.25 million to the firm of Robert Stryk, who had worked with Trump campaign officials, to organize the Hay-Adams event and meetings around it for Mr. Kabila\u2019s special envoy to the United States.\u201d During the event, \u201cTrump administration officials and allies, including the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, gathered with investors atop the Hay-Adams hotel overlooking the White House for a cocktail reception featuring a short presentation by the Democratic Republic of Congo\u2019s special envoy to the United States.\u201d\n\nGiuliani denies he\u2019s acted as a lobbyist for Congo but has also given conflicting accounted the Hay-Adams event. He first said he went there to impress a woman, because the hotel has a great view. Later, Giuliani said he thought there could be business opportunities at the event. \u201cWe\u2019ve always wanted to see what\u2019s Africa all about,\u201d the former New York mayor claimed.\n\n\n\nThe New York Times notes that Giuliani\u2019s business has been discussing providing security consulting to Congo \u201cpossibly through Mer.\u201d Giuliani himself seems to think that security consulting is distinct from lobbying. In a text message to the newspaper, Giuliani said if he did business for Congo \u201cit would only be security consulting.\u201d He added that, \u201cBeyond that, I can\u2019t say anything other than you can assume if we are working in a foreign country, we are doing security \u2014 physical and cyber, antiterrorism, emergency management.\u201d"

    "text": "The first episode opens in 1983 with a member of an underground dissident group being tortured for information. The interrogator goes up to the street level to take a smoke break, where the Palace of Culture and Science can be seen looming in the background. Moments later, a series of bombings unfold across the major cities of Poland (Warsaw, Krakow, Gdansk). The \u201cMarch 12 bombings,\u201d as they will become known, represent a watershed moment for the show\u2019s fictional Poland. The resistance movement was gaining ground by the early 1980s, and the collapse of the communist system was tending toward inevitability until the bombings happened.\n\nFlash forward to 2003 and the country is awash with 20th anniversary commemorations of the attacks. The state TV channel shows mourners laying wreathes on monuments to the victims \u201cwhose sacrifice,\u201d the announcer reads, \u201cpaved the way for the rebirth of our country and its peace and prosperity.\u201d It is against this backdrop of supposed national unity that the characters in 1983 uncover the reality of a deeply divided country where dissent has been erased through falsified autopsy reports and compromised criminal investigations. We follow as the show\u2019s two leads, the earnest young law student Kajetan Skowron (Musia\u0142) and the jaded police Inspector Anatol Janow (Wi\u0119ckiewicz), get to the bottom of the March 12th bombings and what really happened in 1983.\n\nWhen we meet Janow, he\u2019s leading a raid on the apartment of a banned books trader who\u2019s been selling illegal copies of Western books like 1984 and Harry Potter. The police arrive to find the suspect, a young man named \u0141ukasz Zi\u00f3\u0142ek, dead in what by all appearances is a suicide. Janow, however, becomes suspicious when he tries to access Zi\u00f3\u0142ek\u2019s government record, but is told he would need Level 1 clearance to do so (Level 1 demarcates ministers at the highest levels of the security service). Janow begins to suspect that was Zi\u00f3\u0142ek was a member of the Light Brigade, an underground network of young dissidents determined to overthrow the Party.\n\nMeanwhile, Janow\u2019s eventual partner, the law student Kajetan first appears onscreen in the middle of his final oral examination. Kajetan, a sharp student, responds accurately, but predictably to the questions posed, never doubting the authority of the Party in matters of justice. That is until one of the examiners, his mentor Professor Zurawski, warns him against placing too much faith in any man-made legal code, imploring him to look higher, to \u201ctruth.\u201d The truth about what? We soon learn that Zurawski, a former judge, oversaw a case where Janow was lead detective, a mysterious triple homicide that, like Zi\u00f3\u0142ek\u2019s apparent suicide, smacked of a political cover-up. The case file inspires Kajetan to seek out Janow. As the two men begin to connect the dots, the world of double agents and government conspiracies we have come to expect from political thrillers starts manifesting onscreen.\n\nA compelling and well-produced drama, the only real flaw of 1983 is unfortunately, its drastic disconnection from the politics of the present other than highly generalized references to authoritarianism. The show relies on a belief that the Cold War was a uniquely terrifying political reality that can serve as a kind of shorthand for all things bad. The mere mention of \u201cthe Party\u201d and \u201cMoscow\u201d are supposed to be spine chilling. That is a tough sell given the fresh horrors of our own moment, including as they have manifested in Poland. For the past three years, the country has been in the grip of a social crisis, with villains who pose a far more immediate danger than \u201cthe Soviets\u201d in the show."

    "text": "In many ways, the current dispute over dicamba is an inevitable result of the pressures faced by American row-crop farmers. Brazil\u2019s agriculture industry has modernized, and it now rivals America as the world\u2019s top soybean supplier; Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China, which placed heavy tariffs on American farm products, has cut off many farmers\u2019 biggest customer. The price for soybeans has fallen more than 40 percent since 2012, and American farmers are taking on increasing amounts of debt. \u201cWe just haven\u2019t had any of those really good years in the past ten where we can say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m breathing pretty good now,\u2019\u201d said Tim Sullivan, a farmer in Mississippi County, Arkansas.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, most American farms were small\u2014less than 200 acres, on average\u2014and grew a variety of crops. But through the second half of the century, farms began to specialize in single crops, grown in ever-larger amounts. By the Cold War, the industry had embraced a new motto: \u201cGet big or get out,\u201d as Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz put it during his tenure in the 1970s. In an attempt to corner the global food market, the U.S. government encouraged farmers to buy more land, and to harness the power of chemistry\u2014especially newly developed pesticides and fertilizers\u2014to make sure that land yielded as much food as possible.\n\nThe Arkansas Delta is a great place to go very, very big. It\u2019s hot and humid, with a long growing season. Even better is the soil, with lowlands made of rich silt deposited by the Mississippi River over thousands of years. When white settlers arrived in the early nineteenth century, the region was a dense tangle of swamps, and thickets of wetland forest remained through the middle of the twentieth century. By 1980, when Wallace began farming here, the Delta had become an endless blanket of precisely leveled fields. Today, the region is one of the nation\u2019s leading producers of soybeans. The average farm in Mississippi County, where Wallace lived, is nearly 1,400 acres, more than three times the national average.\n\nThe modern era of agribusiness has placed immense economic pressure on farmers. Tending to a massive farm requires a huge investment in manpower and equipment\u2014GPS-rigged tractors, the latest genetically modified seeds, chemicals for killing bugs and weeds, fertilizers to replenish exhausted soils. Farmers like Wallace typically take out millions of dollars in loans each year in order to cover their operating costs. To stay afloat, therefore, farmers need to squeeze every last cent that they can out of their land. A few surprises\u2014an unexpected dry season or a change in global crop prices\u2014can send a farmer tumbling into bankruptcy. Between 1985 and 1995, 11,000 farmers abandoned the Arkansas Delta, unable to shoulder the financial burden. Home to 235,000 farms in 1935, the region now has fewer than 50,000. Farmers like to see themselves as good, neighborly people. But all the pressure has meant that, increasingly, they have had to look out for themselves. \u201cThis is not a team sport,\u201d Tom Burnham told me. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the most individual sport there is\n\n\u201cThis is not a team sport,\u201d Tom Burnham said of the modern agribusiness era and the pressures farmers face. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the most individual sport there is.\u201d\n\nFor these reasons, farmers in Arkansas still remember 1996 as a year of miracles. That spring, when the first Roundup Ready soybeans sprouted, it was as if the age-old problem of weeds had been solved. Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Monsanto\u2019s Roundup herbicide, is a near-universal plant killer. But Monsanto had genetically altered its seeds so that they could resist the herbicide\u2019s effects. When Roundup was sprayed on a field, the Roundup Ready soybeans were the only things that survived. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe what it could do,\u201d David Wildy said. \u201cIt was a wonderful product.\u201d\n\nThe technological breakthrough led to a fundamental shift in American farming practices. Before, most herbicides were sprayed early in the season, prior to a crop emerging from the soil. With Roundup Ready seeds, however, herbicides could be sprayed during the growing season, \u201cover the top\u201d of the crops. This meant that invasive weeds could be attacked not just once, but multiple times in the course of the season. It also meant that the volume of chemicals sprayed rose dramatically; since Roundup Ready\u2019s introduction, global glyphosate use has increased 15-fold. In America, 94 percent of the nation\u2019s soybeans are genetically engineered to resist glyphosate or other herbicides. The numbers for corn and cotton are similar.\n\nRoundup has not been without controversy. This summer, a California jury awarded nearly $300 million to a groundskeeper who blamed his cancer on the chemical. (In October, a judge reduced the amount to $79 million.) Even for farmers, its miracle had shortcomings. The first problem was chemical trespass. After a farmer sprayed glyphosate on his crops, the wind would pick it up and carry it to nearby fields, killing crops that were not genetically engineered to withstand exposure to the chemical. In 2010, Steve Smith, the director of agriculture for an Indiana-based tomato processor, testified to Congress that over the previous four seasons, the company\u2019s growers had lost more than $1 million worth of crops due to glyphosate drift. It was a preview in miniature of the problems farmers have experienced with dicamba.\n\nThe other trouble with Roundup was that, as powerful as it was, the weeds proved stronger. \u201cMonsanto told us there was no way that we would ever see any plant become resistant,\u201d Wildy told me. \u201cThey went through the whole plant physiology and said there\u2019s no way that this plant can ever become resistant. Well, it did.\u201d In 2000, just four years after farmers began spraying Roundup on their fields, mare\u2019s tail became the first common U.S. weed to develop a resistance to glyphosate. Since then, the number of resistant weed species has climbed at an alarming rate. Palmer amaranth, a type of pigweed, developed resistance by 2005 and quickly became the most hated species of vegetation in Arkansas and across the American South. A single pigweed plant can produce 500,000 seedlings, making it extremely difficult to keep in check. The weed climbs high above row crops, blocking out the sun. Studies have shown that an invasion of pigweed can reduce a farmer\u2019s yields by 79 percent. \u201cThe pigweed\u2019s smarter than we are, it seems,\u201d Wildy said. \u201cIt\u2019s changing faster than we can develop technology or chemistry to control the thing. And it\u2019s bad enough that it can take us out of business.\u201d\n\nMonsanto\u2019s Roundup revolution gave birth to this superweed\u2014but it also created an opportunity to profit. The company knew that if it could develop a new seed that could survive a different type of herbicide\u2014one to which weeds were not yet resistant\u2014it would be a blockbuster. In 2005, the path forward became clear. Scientists from the University of Nebraska approached Monsanto with the news that they had discovered what could be the next big thing in agriculture: a bacterial gene for dicamba resistance that could be imported into plants.\n\nDicamba kills plants by mimicking auxin, a growth hormone; plants that are exposed to dicamba literally grow themselves to death, their cells reproducing so quickly that they cannot absorb enough nutrients to sustain themselves. Dicamba is especially deadly to broadleaf plants such as cotton and soybeans. It is also a particularly volatile chemical, which means it easily evaporates after spraying and can be carried by the wind\u2014often in unpredictable directions\u2014making it far more drift-prone than glyphosate. One farmer told me its effects were like a bomb: You see a blast radius of damage surrounding the point where it was sprayed. Over the years, farmers learned that dicamba was useful so long as it was managed carefully\u2014sprayed early, before crops emerged, to kill off-season weeds, or along fencerows and in pastures. But it was almost never used near soybeans or cotton or other delicate plants\u2014and it was illegal to spray over the top, once the plants began to emerge from the soil.\n\nMonsanto\u2019s development of dicamba-resistant seeds was therefore met with worry. \u201cThe widespread use of dicamba is incompatible with Midwestern agriculture,\u201d Steve Smith, the tomato processing official, declared in his 2010 congressional testimony. Its volatility, he said, would simply doom crops like peaches or vegetables or pecans\u2014anything, really, besides the resistant beans.\n\nAs it had done with Roundup, Monsanto planned to develop a line of dicamba-resistant seeds and a matching dicamba-based herbicide. But it needed to clear two hurdles before these products could be released commercially: The Department of Agriculture had to approve the seeds for sale, and the Environmental Protection Agency had to sign off on the company\u2019s herbicide, so that farmers could legally spray it over the top of their crops.\n\nMonsanto initially said that it would not release its new products until both the seeds and the herbicide were approved. After the Department of Agriculture approved a line of dicamba-resistant cotton seeds in January 2015, however, Monsanto announced a limited release, enough seeds to cover a half-million acres. The seeds had other new genetic traits that Monsanto was eager to share with the world, the company said. And because the EPA had not yet approved the spraying of dicamba, Monsanto offered farmers a rebate. The seeds sold out.\n\nDicamba\u2019s effects are like a bomb: You see a blast radius of damage surrounding the point where it was sprayed.\n\nEarly that season, cotton farmers began to complain of dicamba damage. In Arkansas, the plant board determined that in 14 cases, crops had been affected by exposure to the chemical. Two of those cases were against a farmer named Lonnie Gibson. In May 2015, an investigator, prompted by an anonymous complaint, arrived at a field where Gibson\u2019s workers were spraying chemicals. The man in charge identified himself as Curtis Jones. He refused to sign the official paperwork that acknowledged that the field was under inspection and declined to help take samples from the spray tanks. He claimed to know nothing about what chemical was being sprayed, or even what crop was being planted. He told the investigator that she would have to wait for Gibson\u2014but Gibson never appeared. During the delay, some of the tanks and chemical containers were removed from the scene. \u201cMr. Jones was not cooperative,\u201d the investigator later wrote in her report. She eventually determined that dicamba had been sprayed illegally, and Gibson was fined. (He is currently suing the plant board, contesting that decision.)\n\nOther farmers were more cooperative. In 2015, when Mike Wallace filed his initial complaint about dicamba drift against one of his neighbors, a farmer named Donald Masters, Masters admitted to his crime. He tried to abide by the old code: He told the plant board that he had paid another neighbor whose crops were harmed, and was willing to pay Wallace, too\u2014until Wallace made unreasonable demands. \u201cI damaged at least 10 acres of his [soybeans],\u201d Masters said in his testimony to the plant board, \u201cbut he asked me [for] $100,000 for his cotton. Well, his cotton wasn\u2019t damaged.\u201d\n\nMasters\u2019s testimony included an interesting admission. He said he had purchased the dicamba-resistant cotton seeds because a Monsanto sales representative \u201cpretty well assured\u201d him that the EPA would approve the chemical for spraying. Some farmers contend that such promises were part of an official strategy\u2014that Monsanto wanted\n\ndicamba to be illegally sprayed. This would allow the company to \u201ctest the water to see what kind of repercussions\u201d would result from dicamba hitting untargeted fields, as one group of farmers has alleged in a lawsuit. Monsanto has repeatedly denied these charges.\n\nWhatever the intentions, it was clear that the damage did not faze Monsanto. In October 2015, as the cotton harvest was coming in, Monsanto officials announced that dicamba-resistant soybeans, recently approved by the USDA, would go on sale too. The seeds flew off store shelves. According to Monsanto\u2019s estimates, four million acres of dicamba-resistant crops were planted in 2016\u2014five times more than in 2015. The company\u2019s latest product was looking like a success.\n\nSpraying dicamba remained illegal, however. Monsanto expected that its new dicamba-based herbicide would be on the market by the 2016 season, but \u201cwe got delayed in Washington, D.C., with the EPA,\u201d said Scott Partridge, Monsanto\u2019s vice president of global strategy, who was recently named the general counsel for parent company Bayer\u2019s U.S. operations; the German pharmaceutical giant purchased Monsanto this summer. (The delay may have been due in part to the nearly 17,000 public comments the EPA was sifting through as part of the approval process.) Penalties for illegally spraying dicamba were paltry, though\u2014often little more than $1,000. So for farmers who had purchased Monsanto\u2019s dicamba-resistant seeds, the advantages of illegally spraying dicamba far outweighed the fines that the government might impose or the anger of their neighbors. As an Arkansas plant board official told The Wall Street Journal in 2016, \u201cThe farmers are flat out telling us that \u2018we\u2019ll write you a check.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn November 2016, less than a week after Mike Wallace\u2019s funeral, the EPA finally approved Monsanto\u2019s dicamba-based herbicide, XtendiMax. (Two similar formulations from other companies were approved shortly thereafter.) Monsanto said that XtendiMax was approximately 90 percent less prone to drift than earlier formulations. In theory, this should have ended the controversy over dicamba. Farmers would finally be able to spray dicamba legally, and the problem of drift would, for the most part, be solved.\n\n\n\nAs the spring 2017 growing season got underway, however, it became clear that dicamba damage remained out of control, triggering the current spate of lawsuits and investigations by state plant boards. Some experts who study and regulate the industry believe the extent of the damage could be as much as ten times higher than the 3.6 million acres officially reported. Crop insurance does not cover damage by herbicides, so farmers have little incentive to file complaints and potentially start neighbor-versus-neighbor disputes.\n\nMeanwhile, independent studies have suggested that dicamba is still highly prone to drift; the XtendiMax formulation can remain in the air for 36 hours after spraying. Monsanto has argued that these tests are cursory and small-scale compared to its own, and that most dicamba damage has been caused by farmers failing to apply the herbicide correctly. Dicamba acts differently from glyphosate, which farmers are more familiar with. \u201cIt takes different application methods and a focus that growers and applicators need to learn,\u201d Partridge said. \u201cThere\u2019s a learning curve here.\u201d\n\nFor farmers who planted Monsanto\u2019s new seeds, the advantages of illegally spraying dicamba far outweighed the paltry fines the government might impose.\n\nCritics have also accused the EPA of failing to provide adequate oversight. As it weighed whether to approve XtendiMax, the agency only considered data submitted directly by Monsanto itself, which has come under fire in the past for attempting to influence its scientists\u2019 findings. The company would not allow universities to conduct independent tests on XtendiMax prior to the product\u2019s EPA approval. The company believed that such tests would take too long and further delay EPA approval at a time when farmers needed the chemical. \u201cThe decision was made\u2014rather than delay a full year to permit academic testing, let\u2019s get it registered with the EPA,\u201d Partridge said. \u201cLet\u2019s get the product in the marketplace so we don\u2019t have two years of the seed with-out the chemistry.\u201d\n\nCritics, however, argue that the company\u2019s real worry was the potential for negative results, which could squash Monsanto\u2019s hopes for EPA approval of its blockbuster new product. This is a key component in many of the lawsuits against Monsanto. Some scientists now suggest the EPA\u2019s chemical registration process needs to be updated to incorporate more extensive independent testing. \u201cThe problems that occurred in 2017 speak for themselves,\u201d the Weed Science Society of America wrote in a recent report. \u201cMore funding for public research is needed. The true cost of the dicamba-resistant crop technology is not being reflected in the price.\u201d\n\nIn response to the reports of dicamba drift that have flooded state agencies, Monsanto touted all the steps it had taken to address the problem: The company released a new app that detects problematic weather and distributed a million spray nozzles to farmers, free of charge; across the country, 96,000 farmers enrolled in a training program that is a new legal requirement for anyone who buys or sprays XtendiMax. The company also set up a phone line for farmers to report potential cases of crop damage. Chemical drift, Partridge argued, is less extensive per acre sprayed now than it was in 1996, when Roundup Ready was first released\u2014it\u2019s just that dicamba was adopted so much more rapidly than Roundup that the effects have been more obvious. (When I asked for drift data from 1996 to verify the claim, a Monsanto representative said the company had none.) Partridge suggested we live in a different era, too. \u201cIn 1996, when growers wanted to talk about something that they were worried about, or something they needed to learn more about, they talked about it around a four-top table in a coffee shop,\u201d Partridge said. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s on social media, where fact and fiction can take on lives of their own very, very quickly.\u201d\n\nBut at least part of the reason farmers have been buying Monsanto\u2019s dicamba-resistant seeds is to protect their fields. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve done,\u201d David Wildy told me this summer. \u201cAnd I hate to have to do that, but we just had to.\u201d He\u2019d suffered, by his own estimate, hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses over the previous two seasons. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have that kind of damage again,\u201d he said. Monsanto denies that it wants a product that is prone to drift, but the fact that the herbicide can spread easily offers a clear advantage to the company. Once one local farmer adopts the technology, his neighbors have little choice but to do the same.\n\nMy drives across Arkansas this summer were often beautiful. The sky, which stretched endlessly above the flat, lush fields, flared with clouds at sunset. But once farmers taught me how to identify dicamba damage, I began to see the landscape differently, as a slow apocalypse revealed itself in small, grim details. At one lake I drove past, the cypress trees\u2014the last remnants of the wetlands that once dominated the region\u2014bristled with brown needles. At a garden stand, the flowers\u2019 leaves curled inward, a classic sign of dicamba\u2019s effects. Unlike soybean farmers, backyard gardeners have no defensive choice; there is no engineered seed to plant.\n\nA beekeeper who had kept hives in Mississippi County for decades told me he\u2019d had to relocate them; the bees were struggling to produce honey. The culprit, he was almost certain, was the dicamba-induced death of the few stands of wild plants amid the monoculture, essential habitat for pollinators.\n\nNear Wilson, Arkansas, I met with Reggie Cullom, a local doctor who had bought a patch of land because he loved its groves of pecan and oak trees. \u201cI\u2019m the only guy in the world who ever paid farmland prices to pick up limbs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was important to me to try to save the trees.\u201d Now, though, trees that yielded a ton of pecans each season are struggling to produce just 300 pounds, he said. As we drove in Cullom\u2019s truck across his property, he pointed to the treetops, where the leaves were yellowed. Along the edge of the property, the leaves on young oak trees shriveled inward.\n\nCullom\u2019s neighbor, a retired farmer, saw us roll past and ambled over to chat. He got out of farming five years ago, he told me, just early enough to avoid the current dicamba craze. \u201cWe used to use dicamba years ago\u2014but it was early in the year,\u201d he said, and just on certain crops. \u201cAfter that, it was over with.\u201d Before Monsanto released its dicamba-resistant seeds, there was no reason for farmers to spray the herbicide throughout the growing season. Now, he said, he\u2019d like to eat his own vegetables, grow his own fruit\u2014but he can\u2019t. It\u2019s a disorienting development. \u201cI got to thinking one day: What\u2019s going on? What\u2019s changed since I was farming?\u201d\n\nFor today\u2019s farmers, the modern agriculture business can feel like an arms race, in which the only choice is to embrace the latest genetically engineered seeds and the chemicals that go with them. Just as weeds developed resistance to Roundup, however, it\u2019s inevitable that they will develop resistance to dicamba, too\u2014and what will farmers do then? Companies like Monsanto have relied on the idea that science and technology can always be harnessed to overcome whatever challenges the environment presents farmers. But there may be limits to what science can achieve. No new weed-killing chemical has been identified since 1992\u2014which is why chemical companies are returning to older, problematic herbicides like dicamba. Meanwhile, the plants continue to evolve. Jason Norsworthy, an agronomist at the University of Arkansas, told me some farmers are likely to run out of chemical options soon. \u201cI wish I could tell you the future looks bright, ten years, 15 years from now,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nLast summer, as complaints of dicamba drift continued to mount, the Arkansas plant board decided to take action. It announced an emergency ban on all dicamba use and was empowered by the state legislature to levy harsher fines, up to a maximum of $25,000. Some farmers objected\u2014at a board meeting, one noted that farmers in the state had already spent more than $140 million on dicamba-resistant seeds, money that would go to waste if they couldn\u2019t actually use dicamba. In September 2017, more than 300 Arkansas farmers signed a petition opposing the ban. (Tom Burnham, who opposes irresponsible dicamba use, helped draft the language.) They asked the plant board to allow limited use of dicamba under certain conditions. When used responsibly, they argued, dicamba is extremely effective, and the state\u2019s ban had put local farmers at a disadvantage. \u201cPigweed is a major problem in Arkansas, and the state should not be the only state in the South not allowed to use dicamba,\u201d the farmers said.\n\nIn a sign of just how contentious dicamba had become, prosecutors and defense attorneys consciously avoided mentioning the herbicide during Curtis Jones\u2019s trial for killing Mike Wallace. There was too much baggage associated with dicamba, prosecuting attorneys told me. In December 2017, a jury convicted Jones of second-degree murder. He is currently free on bond, awaiting his appeal. (Jones works at a farm chemical store in Missouri that is owned by Lonnie Gibson. When I stopped in, I was told he was out planting watermelons; I left my phone number, but Jones never called.) That month, the Arkansas legislature also asked the plant board to reconsider the dicamba ban. In January, however, the plant board voted to extend it indefinitely.\n\nTensions over dicamba remain high, and more violence seems possible. One farmer at the center of the controversy said he keeps three loaded guns in his office.\n\nDespite all the controversy, the new soybeans remain popular. Monsanto estimated that 50 million acres of dicamba-resistant seeds were planted in 2018, more than twice the acreage that was planted last year. And in Arkansas, despite the plant board\u2019s ban on dicamba, it is clear that farmers aren\u2019t heeding the prohibition. During my visit to the Delta in June, damage reports were already trickling in. Farmers drove me through their fields and pointed out the places where their soybeans\u2019 leaves were crumpling. By season\u2019s end, at least a million acres across the country had been hit\u2014less than in 2017, but still an enormous amount. In October, the EPA extended its approval of dicamba for two years.\n\nSo far, Mike Wallace has been the only person to lose his life in a dicamba-related dispute, but the potential for more trouble seems palpable. There are neighbors who are no longer on speaking terms; squabbles occasionally become fistfights. When I stopped for lunch near where Gibson and Jones live, a group of farmers at a catfish shack warned me to tread carefully, given the tensions. Another farmer, who has been at the center of the debates over dicamba and has been the target of substantial ire, told me he keeps three loaded guns in his office.\n\nEven if farmers in the Arkansas Delta manage to keep the peace, it\u2019s clear that the controversy over dicamba has fundamentally transformed the nature of American farming. One hot and cloudless afternoon this summer, I climbed into the cab of Tim Sullivan\u2019s pickup truck, and together we bumped along a rutted dirt road at the edge of one of his fields, examining the soybean crops. For Sullivan, checking for dicamba damage is now a daily routine during the growing season. The symptoms\u2014the crumpled leaves, the wilting stems\u2014are so familiar to him by now that he can spot them even while driving.\n\nSullivan had recently filed a complaint with the plant board and blamed one of his neighbors for the damage. He understands why someone would spray; farmers need to make a profit. \u201cI get along with him, and just because he sprayed me, I\u2019m not going to try to beat him up, you know?\u201d Sullivan told me. But Sullivan also has to watch out for himself. If another farmer\u2019s chemicals trespass on his fields, he\u2019s going to turn them in to the authorities. The old handshake agreements by which farmers used to resolve disputes will no longer suffice. \u201cHe\u2019s a fine old gentleman, you know,\u201d Sullivan said of his neighbor. \u201cBut he broke the law.\u201d"

    ],
    "text": "In a friend-of-the-court brief, the National Indigenous Women\u2019s Resource Center and the National Congress of American Indians warned the court that abandoning the doctrine could have dire implications for criminal cases on tribal lands, especially as they wrestle with an epidemic of domestic violence and sexual assaults. If a tribal government brings charges, the defendant may ultimately receive a much more lenient sentence than they would under federal law, they told the court. \u201cAnd if a tribal nation elects to forego prosecution, in the hopes that the U.S. Attorney will conclude his or her investigation and bring federal charges, the victim may face a situation where no charges are brought at all\u2014as federal prosecution is never guaranteed.\u201d\n\nThe justices spent most of Thursday\u2019s oral arguments diving into the pre-twentieth century precedents on double jeopardy. But many of the justices\u2019 questions also focused on how scrapping the doctrine would play out in real-world terms. \u201cHow does it work as a practical matter?\u201d Roberts asked Chaiten. \u201cIs it a race to the courthouse? I mean, if a prosecution bars a subsequent one, the state and federal government may have different perspectives, is it whoever can empanel a jury first is going to block the others?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, first of all, the norm in the country is cooperation between federal and state authorities,\u201d Chaiten replied. \u201cWell, it sure wasn\u2019t entirely true at the time of the civil rights actions in the \u201960s and \u201970s,\u201d the chief justice noted. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t true at the time of the fugitive slave law.\u201d The government picked upon this point during its turn before the justices. \u201cYou could imagine state prosecutors in California, as a protest against federal marijuana laws, allowing anyone who\u2019s caught with 50 kilograms of marijuana to walk in and plead to a misdemeanor to frustrate federal prosecutions,\u201d Eric Feigin, who argued for the federal government, offered as a hypothetical.\n\nGorsuch, who appeared to favor Gamble\u2019s arguments, pointed out that the practical concerns cut both ways. He noted that the \u201cproliferation of federal law,\u201d with \u201cover 4,000 statutes now and several hundred thousand regulations,\u201d could give the federal government the opportunity to retry far more state-level cases than when the doctrine was first contemplated. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t that be a practical concern we ought to be more concerned about today?\u201d he asked Feigin.\n\nMost of the attention surrounding Gamble v. United States stems from another case: Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s wide-ranging inquiry into Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election. Some legal experts have warned that jettisoning the separate-sovereigns doctrine could endanger Mueller\u2019s ability to pressure witnesses to cooperate and make it easier for President Donald Trump to shut down the inquiry.\n\nThis fear isn\u2019t completely unfounded. As Mueller\u2019s investigation has drawn closer to the White House, Trump has ratcheted up his efforts to interfere in the inquiry. The president could theoretically fire Mueller, shut down the investigation, and issue pardons to anyone under the special counsel\u2019s scrutiny. That last part is especially worrisome. Presidential pardons are definitive and irrevocable: They can\u2019t be overturned by future presidents or by Congress, and the Supreme Court has long held that presidents have broad discretion in their usage.\n\nTwo limits exist on the president\u2019s pardoning power under current law and precedents. It can\u2019t be used to evade impeachment by Congress, and it only applies to federal criminal offenses, not state ones. That last provision amounts to something of a backstop for the Russia investigation if Trump makes a Nixonian push to shutter the Justice Department\u2019s inquiry. Even if Trump pardons everyone involved, New York and Virginia could theoretically prosecute key witnesses instead. Mueller has stayed characteristically silent on whether this is part of his strategy, and state attorneys general have declined to comment publicly on the matter.\n\nNot every legal expert sees Gamble as a potential threat to the Russia investigation. Fordham University law professor Jed Shugerman and appellate lawyer Teri Kanefield wrote in October that Mueller could structure the charges so that he didn\u2019t prosecute anything that the state attorneys general could not. In the case of Paul Manafort, the jury\u2019s failure to reach a verdict on ten charges during his trial in Virginia last August may have made this easier. \u201cThose deadlocked charges left a mistrial that could theoretically be retried on the federal or state level without a double jeopardy problem, with or without Gamble,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWhen Manafort pleaded guilty [in September], Mueller seemed to leave the door open on many charges by state prosecutors.\u201d\n\nThe justices and the lawyers arguing the case made no mention of Mueller, presidential pardons, or anything suggesting that the Russia investigation was foremost on their minds. Whether a decision in Gamble\u2019s favor would affect it is one of many questions that can\u2019t be fully answered. \u201cThe states and the federal government have never had to be concerned about who goes first,\u201d Hawkins told the justices. \u201cUnder the law of unintended consequences, surely there are practical problems that would arise from [the defendant\u2019s] position that we may not have even thought about today.\u201d A decision is expected by June."

    "text": "In a communique issued on November 23, the Yellow Vests said France should \u201cput in place a real ecological policy and not a few piecemeal fiscal measures.\u201d The World Resources Institute, which translated the document, said in a blog post Friday that the protesters \u201chighlight ecology as a top priority.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe [Yellow Vests\u2019] list of 42 demands includes proposals to make the climate transition fairer, and some demands call for even more ambitious climate action. The Yellow Vests are not against carbon pricing in general: They propose introducing fuel and kerosene taxes for ships and airplanes.\n\n\n\nSo what are the Yellow Vests protesting if not \u201cgreen piety\u201d? As Ghislain Coutard, the man who inspired the protesters\u2019 signature clothing choice, put it, \u201cThe government does everything so that rich stay rich and the poor stay poor.\u201d Macron has long been seen as implementing policies that make life harder for the working class and easier for the wealthy. The planned fuel tax increase was simply the breaking point. That\u2019s why the violent protests continue even though France suspended the tax increase last week.\n\nclimateoutreach.org\n\nEveryday people in France want to fight climate change; they are more worried and outraged about the impacts of global warming than their European neighbors, according to the last European Perceptions of Climate Change report. They just don\u2019t want low- and middle-income people to have to pay for solving a problem caused by multinational corporations. According to the report, most French people oppose raising electricity prices, or raising taxes on fuel, as a method of fighting climate change. The French government\u2019s fuel tax\u2014written into law before Macron took office\u2014is exactly the kind of policy citizens have indicated they do not support.\n\nBut the French do support other climate policies. Significant majorities support the use of public funding to subsidize renewable energy and energy efficiency projects, the report showed. Large majorities also support the Paris climate agreement, contrary to Trump\u2019s tweets. In fact, the report shows that 69 percent of French people support \u201chigh economic penalties for countries that refuse to be part of this agreement.\u201d\n\nThere are lessons to be learned from France\u2019s protests. \u201cPeople will riot in the streets if you try a carbon tax\u201d isn\u2019t one of them. The Yellow Vest protests show the importance of crafting equitable climate policies that don\u2019t make life harder for people who are already struggling. Those type of policies exist\u2014and if they were implemented, fossil fuels would decline at a remarkable rate. Only Trump and the Wall Street Journal would be rioting then."

Bolton admitted that the Islamic State had indeed lost 99 per cent of its territory but said that it was in America\u2019s interest to make sure the group did not enjoy a resurgence.\n\nTrump was not dissuaded, according to the officials, who said the president quickly capitulated by pledging to withdraw, shocking both Bolton and Erdogan. Caught off guard, Erdogan cautioned Trump against a hasty withdrawal, according to one official. While Turkey has made incursions into Syria in the past, it does not have the necessary forces mobilized on the border to move in and hold the large swaths of northeastern Syria where U.S. troops are positioned, the official said.\n\nFrom this reporting, it seems likely that it was never Erdogan\u2019s intention to get the United States to withdraw. Rather he made the demand as a bargaining move, to get other, lesser goals.

    "text": "Until a few months ago, the stock market seemed to respond to the tumultuous news of the Trump era with blissful equanimity. It didn\u2019t matter what Trump tweeted, what investigations were underway, or which countries he threatened with trade war or even nuclear destruction. Stocks kept going up and down of their own accord. But this period of Wall Street being kept separate from politics seems to be ending.\n\nAs The New York Times reports, news that had previously been shrugged off by Wall Street (notably trade war, rising interest rates, and the slowdown of other large economies) is suddenly making investors nervous.\n\n\u201cLast week, elements of all of those combined to drive the S&P 500-stock index down by 4.6 percent, its worst weekly drop since March and one marked by stomach-churning price swings. Stocks are now down 1.5 percent this year,\u201d the newspaper notes. \u201cMore volatility could be in store, as investors assess the allegations by prosecutors that President Trump directed illegal payments to ward off a potential sex scandal, and the possibility that he sought to secretly do business in Russia during his 2016 campaign for the White House.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post also sees signs that the stock market is taking stock of a storm global landscape. \u201cU.S. markets deepened their losses Monday as Britain\u2019s political crisis around Brexit clouded investors\u2019 outlook. British Prime Minister Theresa May put off a key parliamentary vote on her country\u2019s exit from the European Union,\u201d the Post notes. \u201cInvestors are also on edge about developments in the U.S.-China trade dispute.\u201d\n\nInvestment strategist Julian Emanuel argues the sway of the news cycle on politics is out of the ordinary. \u201cThe fact is that politics is driving the economy to an extent that is very atypical,\u201d he told The New York Times. \u201cWe would say probably to the greatest extent that we\u2019ve seen in our investing lifetime.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile the stock market is not the same as the economy as a whole, the current nervousness on Wall Street could presage a recession. If so, there is a real possibility of a feedback effect. President Donald Trump has taken comfort in the success of the stock market under his watch. But once that source of boasting is gone, Trump could become even more erratic. This would create a situation where the president and Wall Street are egging each other on in a downward spiral."

Planned Parenthood. The two cases involve challenges to state efforts to cut off the organization from state Medicaid funds.\n\nThe court declines to hear thousands of cases each year without explanation. In a dissent, however, justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch put forward their own interpretation of the court\u2019s inaction here. Because only four votes are needed to hear a case, their dissent signals that Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh voted against taking up the decision, alongside the court\u2019s four liberals.\n\n\n\nBoth cases address whether Medicaid recipients have the legal standing to challenge a state\u2019s decision to bar Planned Parenthood from receiving state Medicaid funds. There\u2019s a divide among the lower counts on the question, Thomas noted, which is one of the most common circumstances in which the justices intervene. \u201cSo what explains the Court\u2019s refusal to do its job here?\u201d he wrote. \u201cI suspect it has something to do with the fact that some respondents in these cases are named \u2018Planned Parenthood.\u2019\u201d\n\nThomas is being somewhat coy; he, Alito, and Gorsuch are better positioned than anyone else to know why Roberts and Kavanaugh voted against hearing the cases. Their suggestion sends an interesting signal in the legal fight over abortion rights after Justice Kennedy\u2019s retirement. Supporters and opponents alike assumed that Kavanaugh would provide conservatives with their long-awaited fifth vote to sharply curtail the practice or even overturn Roe v. Wade. Monday\u2019s decision suggests that the damage inflicted on the court\u2019s public image by Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation battle may have changed that calculus, and that a substantive move against abortion rights may be further away than many previously thought."

Ayers wanted the job to be temporary while the president preferred a chief of staff willing to commit to at least two years.\n\nKelly\u2019s tenure as chief of staff had been a tumultuous one, marked by repeated failures to impose the promised order that the former general was hired to bring to the White House.

In Blood Simple, for example, they pay homage to noir but turn its volume all the way up: Where Otto Preminger would have lit the mysterious woman\u2019s face from the side, the Coen brothers pick out a few bright features in a sea of darkness.\n\nThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs, available to stream on Netflix on Friday, is the pair\u2019s latest venture into Western territory. Originally conceived as a television series, it is now being presented as an anthology of six shorter movies. Between each story, pages in a storybook about the Old West turn. The movies are related thematically\u2014in each, a character dies\u2014but they don\u2019t cohere into anything like a story. In fact, the vignettes are often plotless themselves.\n\nInstead, each story is a journey to the heart of a storytelling clich\u00e9, like a miner hacking at the dirt in search of a gold vein. We open onto the biggest clich\u00e9 of them all, Monument Valley, where John Wayne wandered in The Searchers. Between its uncanny peaks rides Tim Blake Nelson as Buster Scruggs himself. He is singing a duet with his horse, instantly taking the Western theme to the realm of magical absurdism. Scruggs enters a tavern and slaps the dust from his body, which hangs in the air in the shape of a man as he walks away. The story is a quick-draw fable, with the lesson that there\u2019s always somebody with a faster hand just over the horizon. As in other Coen brothers\u2019 movies, a bullet to the head comes from nowhere."

    "text": "When Amazon announced on Tuesday that it would build one of its new headquarters in Long Island City\u2019s Anable Basin, environmentalists were quick to notice that the site could be partially underwater by 2050. By the next century, it will be completely submerged, according to the environmental research group Climate Central\u2019s most recent projections. Situated in an inlet along the East River, the site is currently home to parking lots and warehouse spaces, but when Amazon breaks ground, which could be as soon as 2019, new apartment complexes and office buildings will go up\u2014all of which would be vulnerable to flooding if sea levels rise even just a few feet.\n\nAfter Hurricane Sandy battered the East Coast in 2012, New York City adopted new building codes to help minimize the damage of such flooding. Today, developers working in flood zones are required to elevate their buildings above the anticipated water level in a storm. An additional set of guidelines for waterfront developers recommends that they build floodgates and levees, create wetlands and barrier islands, and elevate surrounding land to address flooding and erosion. But these recommendations are nonbinding\u2014it\u2019s up to developers to decide whether or not they want to put up the money to build such green infrastructure.\n\nFor Amazon, this means that any attempts to shore up its Long Island City site will have to be entirely on its own steam. Before deciding to split its new headquarters between New York City and Northern Virginia, the company considered several HQ2 locations vulnerable to flooding, including Miami, Newark, and Boston, without making any public statements about how it would adapt to rising tides. Then, on Tuesday, the company agreed\u2014in lieu of property taxes\u2014to offer New York City a series of payments, earmarked for infrastructure improvement (streets, sidewalks, utilities, transportation, schools, and the like). Among the priorities listed on its Memorandum of Understanding with the city was \u201cenvironmental remediation,\u201d the closest Amazon has come to displaying an interest in the environment. As yet, the company has not released any details on what types of projects might be included in this category.\n\nIf history is any guide, however, Amazon will protect itself without thinking of the surrounding neighborhood. Too often, said Amy Chester, the managing director of the collaborative research and design group Rebuild by Design, developers only build barriers to climate change around their own sites, ignoring neighboring areas that are at risk. \u201cWhat you end up having is islands of protection,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, nearby houses and businesses are often left even more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. \u201cIf a developer is protecting its own site, where is that water that it\u2019s displacing going to go?\u201d said Linda Shi, an assistant professor at Cornell\u2019s School of Architecture, Art, and Planning who studies urban environmental governance. \u201cIt\u2019s going to go to the many places that don\u2019t have elevated buildings and flood walls.\u201d"

    "authors": [
      "Adrian Daub"
    ],
    "text": "The AfD\u2019s specter loomed over the proceedings in Munich. Would the German state be able to act as a guardian of a pluralistic, multi-ethnic country? Would the general miasma of national shame congeal into a specific account of who bore responsibility? And would this lengthy trial shed light on what had made the NSU possible\u2014on what had allowed it to thrive and murder in the shadows for nearly ten years?\n\nIn the book\u2019s introduction, the four journalists who compiled the transcripts of the trial\u2014Annette Ramelsberger, Wiebke Ramm, Tanjev Schultz, and Rainer Stadler\u2014come to a clear conclusion: The trial \u201cdid not succeed.\u201d That is because, they say, the prosecution was focused above all on the five defendants, and declared any mutterings of a more systemic problem \u201ca will-o\u2019-the-wisp, like the buzz of flies in our ears.\u201d That this buzz came from the victims\u2019 relatives seemed to matter little.\n\nIn addition to being a historically important document, the book is simply an astonishing object: 2,000 pages, five volumes, crammed so full of information that the bios of the authors are included only as a small insert. This in spite of the fact that, since the NSU trial was neither televised nor recorded, the four journalists had to literally stenograph what they heard in the courtroom, day after day, for 438 days.\n\nKeeping track of the cast of characters alone was no easy task. German law allows victims to hire attorneys to function as \u201cco-plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys,\u201d who can call and cross-examine witnesses. So while the government\u2019s prosecution team was composed of three jurists, the victims of the NSU\u2019s killings and bombings were represented by 58 attorneys. The five defendants, for their part, had a grand total of 14 attorneys present; Zsch\u00e4pe herself began with three, whom she tried to fire halfway through the trial. The judge ruled that they had to remain by her side anyway, and for years Zsch\u00e4pe, her new attorneys, and her fired attorneys shared a bench without her dignifying her former attorneys with a single glance.\n\nUwe Mundlos (left), Uwe B\u00f6hnhardt, and Beate Zsch\u00e4pe at an undisclosed location in 2004. Courtesy of the German Federal Criminal Police Office via Getty Images\n\nFor 248 days Zsch\u00e4pe remained silent. Then she had her new legal team read a statement that disavowed everything. She had once been a Nazi, she claimed, but had changed her ways while living underground. Mundlos and B\u00f6hnhardt had continued to murder in the name of her old ideology without her involvement.\n\nHer co-defendants, as the editors point out, represented different facets of German neo-Nazism. There was Ralf Wohlleben, a functionary for the far-right NPD party who seemed eager to lay claim to a bourgeois sort of respectability; Andr\u00e9 Eminger, a tattooed skinhead and self-declared \u201ccommitted national socialist\u201d; Holger Gerlach, a dimwitted loser who had finally found a tribe; and Carsten Schultze, who had left the neo-Nazi fold decades ago and genuinely seemed stricken about what he had allowed to happen.\n\nBoth Wohlleben and Schultze were indicted for their role in procuring a weapon for the killers, Eminger as an accessory to the bombings and several robberies. He and Gerlach were further indicted for the \u201cformation of a terrorist group.\u201d Zsch\u00e4pe\u2019s defense argued in closing that neither Zsch\u00e4pe nor the other defendants could be said to be have formed a \u201cterrorist group,\u201d as German law requires a group to have at least three members. The lawyers claimed their client was unfairly tied to B\u00f6hnhardt and Mundlos, simply because she lived with them for the entire duration of their crimes. Where the prosecution saw a group, the defense wanted the judges to see only individuals, who may have been friends and roommates, and who may have shared an ideology, but did none of the things they did in concert with one another.\n\nThe transcripts show how carefully the prosecution punctured that fantasy: They were able to connect the fairly obvious dots suggesting that, yes, these people meant to start a terror cell when they first went underground in 1998, and, yes, their helpers either knew what they were doing or had a good-enough idea.\n\nBut the editors point out that the trial went beyond the crimes of these five defendants. They call it \u201ca deep core drill into German history, unearthing dangerous sediments underneath a surface of economic prosperity and seemingly firmly established democratic values.\u201d In her closing arguments, the federal prosecutor Annette Greger claimed that \u201cthe motive of all these crimes was a far right ideology, the fever dream of a country free of foreigners, and the intention to shake this free, this friendly country, in which we live, to its core, in order to prepare the ground for a disgusting Nazi regime.\u201d\n\nWhatever else the NSU was, it wasn\u2019t an outlier. Rather it was deeply consonant with a cruel, nationalist streak in German politics that is only getting stronger.\n\nIn other words, the prosecution found itself in the somewhat schizophrenic position of wanting to establish a conspiracy\u2014these five people, plus the two dead ones, had been an organization\u2014but not too much of one. They aimed not only to secure verdicts against these five defendants, but also to position their crimes as malignant outliers in \u201cthis free, this friendly country.\u201d But the victims\u2019 attorneys presented a different story: Whatever else the NSU was, it wasn\u2019t an outlier. Rather it was deeply consonant with a cruel, nationalist streak in German politics that is only getting stronger.\n\nFrom the day the NSU was finally discovered, the central question was how they had been able to carry on in secret for so long. There has long been a sense that German security forces are \u201cblind on the right side,\u201d as Germans put it. For the Federal Criminal Bureau (BKA) and the Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), \u201cterrorism\u201d invariably meant left-wing terrorism. And since 9/11, it had meant either left-wing or Islamist terrorism. As in the United States, the security forces frequently downplayed or ignored right-wing violence altogether. They were unwilling to recognize any larger structure to it, preferring to see irrational flare-ups where others saw evidence of broader forces at work.\n\nAt other times the security forces implicitly condoned right-wing activity. Earlier this year, it was revealed that Hans-Georg Maa\u00dfen, head of the Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), had met years ago with politicians from the AfD to suggest ways of keeping the party off his own Service\u2019s radar. And after neo-Nazis and members of the AfD marauded through the town of Chemnitz earlier this year, chasing people they took to be immigrants, Maa\u00dfen gave interviews calling reports about these events fake news\u2014based not on his own agency\u2019s investigative work, it turned out, but on videos and memes circulating in far-right circles. Maa\u00dfen was finally fired in early November.\n\nOnly thanks to the efforts of the co-plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, acting for the victims, do the police, the BKA, and the BfV remain a presence in these transcripts. Which is crucial, as the police cut a disturbingly large figure in the NSU story. For example, the police let the trio slip away during the initial search of their garage in 1998, which was itself rented from a policeman. After the crimes were discovered in 2011 the BfV immediately began collecting and shredding files pertaining to right-wing infiltration. And in all those years police allegedly saw nothing, or saw only immigrant-on-immigrant violence.\n\nBefore the NSU published their video, their assassinations were known as the \u201cD\u00f6ner-killings,\u201d after the type of kebab immensely popular in Germany. Investigators seemed determined to seek the origins of these shocking crimes amongst the immigrant communities they terrorized. One of the task forces on the case, for example, was code-named \u201cBosporus.\u201d When a witness identified as Beate K. went to the police after one of the crimes, she was shown mostly pictures of Turkish men as potential suspects. She was also asked to opine \u201cwhether the Turkish mafia might be behind it: weapons smuggling, money laundering.\u201d In the case of the murdered policewoman Mich\u00e8le Kiesewetter, the NSU\u2019s final victim, authorities came to focus on a Roma family that had been somewhere in the vicinity of the crime scene, obsessively tracking their travels across Europe.\n\nBeate Zsch\u00e4pe appearing at a Munich court in July 2018. CHRISTOF STACHE/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe trial transcripts show that this compulsion was shared by an entire society\u2014that the same prejudices that governed the investigators were at work in most non-immigrant witnesses. When Mundlos and B\u00f6hnhardt murdered S\u00fcleyman Task\u00f6pr\u00fc, a witness claimed she had heard two men arguing beforehand \u201cin a foreign language.\u201d When another witness crossed paths with Mundlos and B\u00f6hnhardt immediately after the murder of \u0130smail Ya\u015far in Nuremberg, she initially described them as \u201csouthern types,\u201d i.e. ethnically non-German. The press operated with much the same biases: The left-leaning weekly Der Spiegel fantasized in 2011 that the killings were clearly the work of Turkish ulta-nationalists\u2014\u201cthe shot in the face a sign \u2026 for a loss of honor,\u201d the murders an indication that Turks lived in a \u201cdark parallel society\u201d within Germany.\n\nThe NSU transcripts tell of a state and a society that couldn\u2019t have seen what the NSU was doing, even if they had bothered to try. Their blinkers were so powerful that the authorities often turned their suspicions on the victims. With regard to almost all of the nine victims who were either immigrants or of immigrant descent\u2014and, tellingly, not in the case of the dead policewoman\u2014the police got it into their heads that the family\u2019s stupefied trauma was actually \u201ca cartel of silence\u201d that they would have to break. In one case, they told a widow that her slain husband had been having an affair with a German woman and had two children by her. In another, they staked out a victim\u2019s widow\u2019s home. They questioned the families about organized crime, about drugs, about the outlawed Kurdish party PKK.\n\nThe NSU transcripts tell of a state and a society that couldn\u2019t have seen what the NSU was doing, even if they had bothered to try.\n\nWho has a right to be silent and whose silence is criminalized? The state\u2019s position in this question is all too clear throughout the trial. One is struck by the persistent silence that greets the phalanx of prosecutors and victims\u2019 attorneys in these transcripts. When Zsch\u00e4pe finally speaks, it is, as one family member of a victim put it, almost like \u201cshe was mocking us\u201d: She denies everything, gets bogged down in pointless details, and offers hollow apologies and disavowals of her \u201cformer\u201d beliefs. Indeed, her team argues that she is a victim herself. Again and again, the defense attorneys worry that their clients are being tried in the media and prejudged. All the wrongs that had been visited on the victims\u2019 families for ten years, they sought to reclaim, implausibly, for their clients.\n\nIt is a sound legal strategy, of course, part of a zealous defense. But, as the editors point out, what happened in the courtroom could not but resonate outside of it. It is telling that discounting the victimization of others while angrily claiming victimhood for yourself has been a central strategy of the AfD during its rise. The party has shown a Trumpian knack for casting people hurling bricks at housing for refugees as concerned citizens, and terrified refugees as dangerous predators. Whether they want to close the borders, set fire to kebab shops, or beat up refugees, an increasing number of Germans are ready, even eager, to withhold empathy from the persecuted and present themselves as the real victims.\n\nIn her closing arguments, prosecutor Greger claimed that Zsch\u00e4pe, Mundlos, and B\u00f6hnhardt hated the police and the state they represented. The NSU\u2019s campaign was aimed at delegitimizing the German state, an accusation corroborated by the massive lists found in their various hideouts contain the addresses of members of the Bundestag and centrist political organizations.\n\nBut if the German mainstream was a theoretical target of the NSU, it wasn\u2019t a target the NSU ever actually attacked. With the one, still mysterious exception of the attack on two members of the police in Heilbronn in southern Germany, which resulted in the death of Kiesewetter, the NSU killed immigrants. It killed in kebab shops and bodegas, in internet cafes and flower stands. In 15 bank robberies not a single person was killed, though several were shot. The bank robberies almost all took place in the former communist East, in areas that have few immigrant communities. In contrast, all but one of the NSU\u2019s killings took place in former West Germany, and all of them occurred in large, diverse communities. Whatever the NSU took itself to be attacking, it was far more specific than the German state writ large.\n\nCarsten Schultze appearing at a court in Munich in June 2013. CHRISTOF STACHE/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDid members of the NSU act alone? In the NSU\u2019s lists of potential targets, victims\u2019 attorney Mehmet Daimag\u00fcler points out, there is a Turkish-German prosecutor in the small Westphalian town of Siegen. Daimag\u00fcler grew up in Siegen, he practiced law there\u2014yet he had never heard of this man. How had the NSU? As Elif Kuba\u015f\u0131k, whose husband was murdered in his kiosk in Dortmund in 2006, remarked: \u201cDid they have helpers in Dortmund? Do I still see them around town sometime?\u201d\n\nThe slogan that rightwing protesters chant as they march through the cities, especially in East Germany, is \u201cwe are the people.\u201d Whether or not the NSU\u2019s enormous lists are evidence of an extensive network of helpers, informers, and fellow travelers, or whether they were meant merely to create that appearance, almost doesn\u2019t matter. They are meant to raise Elif Kuba\u015f\u0131k\u2019s question, and they are meant to make people like her look over their shoulder in their own country. Even if we believe that they carried out their actions unbeknownst to anyone around them, the NSU did not really act alone. They could count on society\u2019s biases and prejudices, on a rising politics of resentment, to sustain them at least for a time.\n\nSome of the more moving moments in these trial transcripts consist of the otherwise fairly neutral panel of judges going above and beyond what is necessary for purely evidentiary reasons to ask the victims\u2019 families about their lives since the attacks. It is as though they wanted to acknowledge that while the violence done to these families cannot be undone, the persistent abstracting away of their suffering can at least be reversed. Towards the end of the trial Dilek \u00d6zcan, daughter of \u0130smail Ya\u015far, addressed Carsten Schultze, the only defendant who showed remorse: \u201cThey told me that you, among all the defendants, were the only one who didn\u2019t look away when they put pictures of the dead up on the screen, and that your eyes were wide with horror.\u201d Someone finally seeing what they have allowed to happen is the best these families could hope for in this trial.\n\nIn the end, Schultze\u2019s evident agony didn\u2019t help him much. While Zsch\u00e4pe got the maximum allowed by German law (15 years without the possibility of parole), Schultze was the only one of the four other defendants who got exactly what prosecutors had asked for. Andr\u00e9 Eminger was sentenced to time served and was released hours later to the hooting of his supporters. Less than a week later Ralf Wohlleben left prison. Their strategy of keeping mum, and of presenting themselves as victims, had worked. As of November, only Zsch\u00e4pe and Schulze remain in prison. As Annette Ramelsberger, one of the editors of this staggering document, put it on the day the NSU trial ended: \u201cContrition isn\u2019t worth it, it turns out. Silence is. The far right will learn that lesson all too well.\u201d"

    "text": "\u201cThey think: well if he\u2019s a Nazi for not wanting immigrants here, then I guess I am too.\u201d\n\nStanding in the crowd outside the auditorium in which Merkel was speaking on Sunday, a 50-year-old nurse with blonde bangs named Marlene told me she\u2019d been marching with the far-right Pro Chemnitz demonstrators every week since the summer. On the night after Daniel Hinnig, the man whose death triggered the riots, was stabbed, she was on the streets with the other far right protesters. She didn\u2019t see neo-Nazis chasing migrants or performing illegal Hitler salutes, she told me\u2014video footage and eyewitness accounts of the banned salutes eventually led to prosecutions\u2014and is convinced the government lied about them. Since then, however, the core group of hooligans and skinheads at the Pro Chemnitz rallies has been impossible to overlook.\n\nIn 2016, the recorded number of racist and xenophobic attacks in Germany spiked dramatically. But last year, despite the xenophobic Alternative for Germany being elected into parliament for the first time as the leading opposition party, that number decreased. So for Andre L\u00f6scher, who is a counsellor for victims of far-right violence in Chemnitz, it was scary to note that since the riots in August, forty-seven racist hate crimes have been reported, which is already twice the total number of hate crimes recorded for the small city last year. Four restaurants have been attacked. On September 14, a group of men walked into a park and threw a glass bottle at a 26-year-old Iranian\u2019s head after demanding to see his and his friends\u2019 identification; it later turned out that some of the men in the group of attackers were making a plan via Whatsapp to buy guns and \u201coverthrow the media dictatorship and its slaves\u201d on the anniversary day of German reunification, on October 3. On the 80-year anniversary of Kristallnacht, the 1938 pogrom against Germany\u2019s Jews, a dozen \u201cstumbling stones\u201d\u2014bronze plaques that commemorate residents who died in the Holocaust\u2014were smeared with oily tar, while the Pro Chemnitz lawyer made a call to arms against \u201cthe Merkel regime.\u201d\n\nA similar pattern of violence has played out in Wurzen, another Saxon city that was previously terrorized by neo-Nazis in the post-reunification chaos of the 90s. Recently, there have been a series of arson attacks and physical assaults on the street. In the evenings, youths who call themselves \u201cthe people\u2019s militia\u201d get drunk and march through the city chanting \u201cOut, foreigners!\u201d They\u2019re the sorts of street protest associated with the groups like PEGIDA (an acronym that stands for Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West). In Saxony, L\u00f6scher has observed that when Pegida and other far right demonstrations started to wane a few years ago, hate crimes decreased in the areas where protests stopped. Now, both the demonstrations and the hate crimes seem to be back. \u201cWhen so many people are moving around in the streets and notice that they are many,\u201d he says, \u201cIt really motivates them.\u201d\n\nYet there are signs of pushback. A few weeks ago, the Chemnitz city council installed shiny new cameras in the city center to restore a sense of security. In Berlin, 242,000 people took to the streets last month to protest against the far right. 75,000 people showed up in September to an anti-racism rock concert in Chemnitz. Next week will be the first time since August that Pro Chemnitz will not hold their Friday night rally. And barely two weeks after the far-right\u2019s nemesis, Angela Merkel, announced that she would not seek re-election as German chancellor\u2014cause for celebration among the anti-immigrant crowd\u2014demonstrations during her Sunday visit were relatively restrained.\n\nLike the far-right street movements before them, and also somewhat like President Donald Trump in the United States, speakers at the Pro Chemnitz rallies do their best to assure people that the media lies about their crowd size. (\u201cI see at least 5000 people!\u201d, one guy blustered at Friday night\u2019s rally. The police estimated 2,500.) But however intimidating they may understandably be to their targets, it\u2019s also clear the groups lack real momentum. \u201cWe are too few,\u201d one man says. He has been active in far-right politics since he broke up with his long-term girlfriend one year ago. But now that daylight is limited and winter is coming, \u201cI can also think of other things to do on a Friday night instead of freezing my ass off here.\u201d Even Marlene, who spent most of the evening reciting the latest conspiracy theories the far-right has concocted based on the UN migration pact, and who is convinced that \u201cdoom is coming,\u201d agrees."

    "text": "The camera spins around our three central women, who also each spin in different scenes. Abigail toys with a male suitor in the woods, and he lifts her to whirl her around; Sarah dances at court to a bizarre choreography, which also requires she be lifted and spun. It\u2019s a symphony in disorientation, underscoring the bewilderment each character experiences as their m\u00e9nage a trois shifts its balance.\n\nIf The Favourite is an exercise in naturalism, it also contains a profound artifice. Each scene is an elaboration of raw materials, like a headdress sculpted out of fruit. The tapestries that cover the walls of the Queen\u2019s bedroom seem to hold the blue English daylight coming in from the windows. As in Bergman\u2019s Fanny and Alexander, these fiber-and-wood interiors feel shockingly new to our plastic-adjusted eyes. One morning, Abigail rides out to the woods in search of herbs to soothe Anne\u2019s gout. The dawn light is the slightest cobalt glow, with Hatfield House\u2019s wisteria flowing down the walls in a lavender rain. When Sarah goes missing, riders seek her with flaming torches against a sky so indigo that it looks like paint.\n\nThe daylight feels like fresh water; the candlelight yellow and greasy like an overly aged Chardonnay. Fire is cooled against white marble. A white rabbit hops on a dark hardwood floor. A single teardrop blazes against Emma Stone\u2019s daylit cheek. Politicians cavort by night, throwing fruit in slow motion at a laughing naked man, cut against shots of Sarah galloping into the woods on a black horse. Bare trees in the moonlight, bare bums in the palace\u2014both shine.\n\nAtsushi Nishijima / 20th Century Fox\n\nI understand pearls now, having seen them filmed this way. Oddly, I also understand the powdered wigs and mouches of the men of this time; Nicholas Hoult as the politician Robert Harley is bitchy and radiant in his makeup. Most of his scenes are interior and at night, as he stalks the house holding candles, lighting himself like Caravaggio\u2019s David against the black. Hair and makeup designer Nadia Stacey explains, \u201cIt\u2019s probably the only period in history where the men were so much more adorned than the women.\u201d Anne, Sarah, and Abigail are mostly barefaced, though their changing appearances track their fortunes. As Abigail gains power, her hair gets higher, while the descending Sarah is injured by a horse, forcing her to wear a streak of black lace against her face.\n\nThe script is splashy and acidic. Sarah tells the queen that she looks \u201clike a badger\u201d in makeup. One male politician keeps a duck named Horatio on a leash. \u201cMust the duck be here?\u201d Harley asks. The answer: \u201cHoratio is the fastest duck in the city!\u201d Sarah keeps the Queen\u2019s books, and derides a staffer for exceeding her \u201ctapestry budget.\u201d The political context is the war in France, with the Whigs and Tories each beseeching Anne to go in a different direction. It\u2019s a fairly straightforward allegory of the fight between Abigail and Sarah, but it also gives Hoult a chance for some great lines. In one scene, he extorts Abigail for information. \u201cOh look, a wren, how cute,\u201d he says, before pushing her in a ditch. As Sarah makes one final attempt at bullying Abigail, the new royal pet retorts, \u201cAll I know is, your carriage awaits and my maid is on her way up with something called a pineapple.\u201d"

    "authors": [
      "Evan Kindley"
    ],
    "text": "By the time he died in 2000, Gorey was a minor celebrity, much sought after both as a freelance illustrator and as a profile subject. He devoted his last years on Cape Cod, touchingly, to writing, designing, and directing avant-garde plays for a local theater troupe called Le Th\u00e9atricule Sto\u00efque. One of them, Omlet, or Poopies Dallying, was a collage of garbled texts from early versions of Hamlet, performed with handmade papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 puppets. From Dery\u2019s descriptions, these shows, few of which ever made it off the Cape, were as strange as anything in the Gorey oeuvre, and proof of the strong streak of perversity that never deserted him.\n\nOne of the virtues of Dery\u2019s book is its reminder that Gorey\u2019s art was far more subtle, diverse, formally inventive, and just plain weird than his reputation for sinister whimsy suggests. In the 100-odd books that he published during his lifetime\u2014books with three-word titles like The Fatal Lozenge, The Pious Infant, The Blue Aspic, The Disrespectful Summons\u2014he experimented promiscuously with format. He crafted abecedaries (alphabet books), postcard sets, pop-up books, \u201cslice books\u201d (in which the reader can mix and match portions of an image to create new ones), and even a variant of the choose-your-own-adventure story (from 1987\u2019s utterly confounding The Raging Tide: \u201cHooglyboo crammed Figbash inside a vase. If this strikes you as clever, turn to 11. If all this seems too terrible to contemplate, turn to 29.\u201d)\n\nHe was also, more than we tend to think, an artist of his time. While the popular conception of Gorey is of a man born 50 years too late, a stubborn antiquarian who was always, in Dery\u2019s words, \u201csignaling a conscientious objection to the present,\u201d he saw himself as working in the tradition of the twentieth-century avant-garde. \u201cIf I had to say I\u2019m like anyone I suppose it\u2019d be Gertrude Stein and Beckett,\u201d he told a reporter in 1992, and he also took inspiration from contemporaries like Jorge Luis Borges and Raymond Queneau. (Gorey, in turn, inspired other avant-gardists: See the Austrian jazz composer Michael Mantler\u2019s 1976 album The Hapless Child, for example.)\n\nGorey\u2019s avant-garde bona fides are visible in his work\u2019s combination of absurdity with rigorous formalism: The books tend to take essentially arbitrary conceits (a parody of Victorian pornography, a series of very slightly asymmetrical landscapes) and stretch them as far as they can go. The obviously labor-intensive character of Gorey\u2019s immaculately crosshatched drawings, which often resemble Victorian engravings, adds to the sense of provocation. One is constantly moved to think: He put all that work into this?\n\nSurrealism, particularly the collage novels of Max Ernst, strongly influenced Gorey. Some of his books assume the trappings of conventional narrative genres like the detective story or the morality play, but many are really exercises in dream logic. The Object-Lesson, for instance, begins, \u201cIt was already Thursday, but his lordship\u2019s artificial limb could not be found,\u201d and proceeds from there through a series of eerie non sequiturs, crescendoing with the immortal lines: \u201cOn the shore, a bat, or possibly an umbrella, disengaged itself from the shrubbery, causing those nearby to recollect the miseries of childhood.\u201d\n\nOther books take a Steinian delight in the play of language: the text of The Nursery Frieze, for instance, is a string of recondite single words (\u201caccismus,\u201d \u201cbadigeon,\u201d \u201cepistle,\u201d \u201cquodlibet,\u201d \u201chiccup\u201d) spoken by a stubbornly advancing capybara. In L\u2019Heure Bleue, two dogs wearing burglar masks and matching letterman sweaters engage in a Beckettian dialogue: \u201cIt is not the living, it is the being lived on,\u201d one dog sagely observes. \u201cI must remember to write that, along with some other things, down,\u201d the other replies. And a book as bonkers as The Inanimate Tragedy (\u201c\u2018Death and Distraction!\u2019 said the Pins and Needles. \u2018Destruction and Debauchery!\u2019 Almost at once the No. 37 Penpoint returned to the Featureless Expanse.\u201d) is closer in spirit to Marcel Duchamp or Lautr\u00e9amont than it is to Tim Burton or Lemony Snicket.\n\nWorks like these are the best evidence for Gorey\u2019s claim that he\u2019s \u201cdoing something else entirely,\u201d or trying to: You can feel him pushing the limits of his chosen medium\u2014the illustrated book\u2014just as Stein and Queneau pushed the novel, Beckett the play, or Duchamp the painting. If Gorey\u2019s work lacks the philosophical heft of his modernist predecessors, he makes up for it with sheer experimental brio, not to mention beauty. He is at once essentially limited and infinitely ambitious.\n\nAt over 500 pages, Born to Be Posthumous is a baggier, less discerning biography than Gorey deserves. (He was nothing if not economical in his own work: \u201cI like \u2026 leaving things out, being very brief,\u201d he once said.) And yet, despite its length, it often feels factually thin. Although Dery\u2019s research into Gorey\u2019s life brings to light some fascinating details, there are so many lacunae that he frequently resorts to speculation. The book\u2019s pages are littered with qualifications such as \u201cWho knows,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s easy to imagine,\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d \u201cWe can only guess,\u201d \u201cWe have no idea,\u201d and \u201cWho can say?\u201d\n\nOne of the many things Dery can only guess about is Gorey\u2019s sexuality, which features heavily in his introduction, his conclusion, and in several passages throughout. Dery notes that Gorey\u2019s friends were predominantly gay men, and that nearly everyone who met him believed him to be gay, but that he often equivocated about his sexual identity in interviews. He told a journalist who asked him about his sexual preference in 1980 that he was \u201cneither one thing nor the other particularly.\u201d In the original published article, he adds, \u201cI suppose I\u2019m gay. But I don\u2019t really identify with it much.\u201d As a lifelong celibate, he pointed out, he was basically asexual: \u201cI\u2019ve never said that I was gay and I\u2019ve never said that I wasn\u2019t. A lot of people would say I wasn\u2019t because I never do anything about it.\u201d Indeed, though his letters attest to a series of obsessive crushes (all on men), there is no evidence that Gorey ever had sex with anyone, male or female.\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly legitimate, of course, for biographers to pay attention to their subjects\u2019 sex lives\u2014or, in Gorey\u2019s case, their lack thereof. But Dery insists on treating what seems like a fairly cut-and-dried situation as a \u201cmystery.\u201d \u201cOf all the contradictions [Gorey] contained, his sexuality was surely the most puzzling,\u201d he writes toward the end of Born to Be Posthumous. \u201cThe question of Gorey\u2019s sexuality has all the makings of a good mystery.\u201d But is there really anything very puzzling or mysterious about a man who came of age in the 1950s, and whose life was largely celibate, being reluctant to publicly identify himself as gay? Under the circumstances, Gorey\u2019s answers to this line of questioning seem to have been pretty candid."

      "Matt Ford"
    ],
    "text": "Ford, a Republican, nonetheless did not regret his decision. In a letter to USA Today written a few months before his death in 2005, he noted that great justices were not typically counted among a president\u2019s achievements. \u201cEisenhower\u2019s Earl Warren, John Adams\u2019 John Marshall and Wilson\u2019s Louis Brandeis immediately come to mind; although references to these great jurists are usually absent in presidential biographies,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLet that not be the case with my presidency. For I am prepared to allow history\u2019s judgment of my term in office to rest (if necessary, exclusively) on my nomination thirty years ago of Justice John Paul Stevens to the U.S. Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nOther presidents weren\u2019t as fortunate. Jimmy Carter served a full four-year term after defeating Ford in 1976, but no vacancies emerged, making Carter the only president in the twentieth century to name no justices to the high court. This is not to Carter\u2019s discredit; it wasn\u2019t up to him. But the circumstances still produced a remarkable quarter-century of conservative influence over the court\u2019s trajectory. After Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s appointment of Thurgood Marshall in 1968 and until Bill Clinton\u2019s appointment of Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993, Republican presidents placed eleven justices on the high court.\n\nSome of those justices, such as William Rehnquist and Antonin Scalia, were reliable conservative votes on the court. Others, like Sandra Day O\u2019Connor and Anthony Kennedy, were generally conservative but not doctrinaire about it. Bush\u2019s selection of Souter was meant to fall in the reliable column. Souter, a patrician New Englander like Bush, was not a member of the conservative legal movement. He did not travel in Federalist Society circles, nor did he identify as a particularly conservative jurist, though the Bush White House vouched for him to conservative activists.\n\nBush and his aides were ultimately wrong. Within a few years, Souter had become a reliable vote for the court\u2019s liberal wing. A key turning point came in 1993, when the court heard Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Four of the court\u2019s members, including Thomas, had signaled in previous cases that they would overturn Roe v. Wade if given the opportunity. The nation expected in Casey that they, plus a fifth vote, would swing the axe. Instead, justices Kennedy, O\u2019Connor, and Souter forged a compromise that upheld Roe\u2019s core ruling\u2014that the Constitution protects a woman\u2019s right to obtain an abortion\u2014while imposing a new test to determine whether abortion restrictions posed an \u201cundue burden\u201d to that right.\n\nRoe\u2019s survival in Casey was a jarring defeat for the conservative legal movement, one that led them to rethink their approach to judicial nominations. No longer would right-wing activists take the White House\u2019s word on a nominee\u2019s ideological fitness. Supreme Court justices selected by Republican presidents now have to meet the advice-and-consent requirement twice: first from the conservative intelligentsia, and then from the Senate. Harriet Miers, a George W. Bush loyalist without ties to the movement, failed the test and withdrew from consideration in 2005. John Roberts, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh passed it with flying colors."

    "text": "But Cuomo has also spent his time in office stifling progressives in his state, going as far as to prop up Republican control of the state senate so that a number of measures never made it to his desk. Cuomo has touted his business-friendly bona fides, culminating in his successful wooing of Amazon, while advocating for tax cuts and often seeming indifferent to social spending. He also has ethical baggage. Two of his top aides were convicted on corruption charges earlier this year. \u201cFor any other governor in America, this would be earth-shattering, but in Andrew Cuomo\u2019s Albany, it was just a Thursday,\u201d Nixon said after Cuomo\u2019s economic guru was convicted on corruption charges in July, in a line that likely would have been repeated in a Democratic presidential primary.\n\n\n\nIf Cuomo\u2019s progressive record as governor was debatable, Patrick\u2019s was almost non-existent. He had a mixed, unremarkable record: He was instrumental in the defeat of a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, but expanded charter schools and legalized casinos. His most ambitious plan, a $1.9 billion tax increase to fund a statewide rail expansion, went nowhere. And he accrued political baggage almost immediately after leaving office in 2015 by joining Bain Capital, the private equity firm whose role in outsourcing jobs helped cost former partner Mitt Romney the presidency in 2012. Still, Patrick is popular among former Obama administration officials. \u201cIf you were to poll 100 notable Obama alumni, the only two people who would win that 2020 straw poll right now are [Joe] Biden and Patrick,\u201d a former White House aide told Politico last year.\n\nGiven the leftward drift of the party and the criticism Clinton and Obama received for cashing in on Wall Street speeches, it\u2019s perhaps not surprising that Cuomo and Patrick decided to back out. In a crowded primary field, their records would immediately come under fire; indeed, they would likely be synonymous with the corruption of the party\u2019s elite. The party\u2019s donor class perhaps would have kept their campaigns aloft for a time, but ultimately Cuomo, very much the machine Democrat, and Patrick, who has been out of politics for three years, would not have an immediate base of support. Big-donor dollars can only get you so far, especially against candidates like Sanders and Warren who are proven small-donor powerhouses.\n\n\n\nWith Cuomo and Patrick bowing out, the Democratic establishment appears to be focusing its attention on Biden and O\u2019Rourke. For months, Biden has been cited as a favorite of former Obama officials. While there\u2019s a bumper crop of progressives, centrist Democrats have few options\u2014and none with Biden\u2019s name recognition. O\u2019Rourke is hardly the insider that Biden is, but he has been wooed by Obama in recent days and was publicly urged to run by former Obama aide Dan Pfeiffer. Both potential candidates have in spades what Patrick and Cuomo lack: charisma and authenticity.\n\nBoth have flaws as well. Biden will be 78 in January of 2021, when he would assume office if elected, and has a long, checkered legislative record. \u201cAmong the potential trouble spots is a 2005 bankruptcy law he championed that made it harder for consumers and students to get protection under bankruptcy,\u201d USA Today explained, \u201cand the 1994 crime bill that created financial incentives for states that imprison people, affecting many black and Latino youths.\u201d Biden also played a pivotal role in the shameful treatment of Anita Hill when she brought sexual harassment allegations against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas in 1991."

    "text": "On Tuesday, President Trump\u2019s task force on the U.S. Postal Service\u2019s troubled finances released its report on the future of the agency. The word \u201cAmazon\u201d appears nowhere in the body of the report, only in an appendix listing organizations that provided input. But virtually every article about the report led with the possibility that Amazon would have to pay more to use the USPS for package delivery.\n\n\u201cPostal report puts muscle behind Trump\u2019s Amazon grudge,\u201d Axios blared. \u201cPostal Service Review Proposes Sweeping Changes Likely to Hit Amazon,\u201d said The Wall Street Journal. \u201cPostal service should be allowed to charge more for packages, review following Trump spat with Amazon finds,\u201d CNBC reported.\n\nThis response is understandable, given that Trump ordered the creation of the task force shortly after alleging that Amazon was taking advantage of the Postal Service. But the impact on Amazon is not the most important piece of this study. The task force did not recommend selling off the Postal Service, as some feared it would. But it did suggest a radical change that would separate the Postal Service from its core mission: to provide unfettered access to communication and commerce to all citizens, regardless of who they are or where they live. Such a change would be an attack on the individual freedom of all Americans, but especially those in poor, rural communities.\n\nThe USPS was established in the Second Continental Congress of 1775, before there was a United States. For nearly 250 years, its operations have been guided by the universal service obligation. This guarantees regular postal service to every American residence and business at a standard, affordable price. It includes six-day delivery and post offices within every zip code. No area of the country is discriminated against, no matter how costly or difficult to reach. The universal service obligation is funded by giving the USPS exclusive access to the mailbox and a monopoly on letter delivery."

    "text": "Ivy League schools\u2014which still function to some extent as social gatekeepers in the United States\u2014still have legacy admissions, giving a leg up to families like the Bushes. In 2017, a third of the incoming Harvard class falls under the \u201clegacy\u201d category. Nor, in an age of increasing inequality and stagnant social mobility, are members of the white working class more able to join the elite than in the past. The current ruling class is hardly characterized by openness to outside talent. Even though the incoming Congress is described as the most diverse ever, people of color only make up 102 members (or 19 percent) in a body of 535. The Trump White House is notoriously lacking in diversity. There is no black senior advisor in the current administration. There are only three black CEOs running Fortune 500 companies.\n\nWASP power hasn\u2019t disappeared, nor are the cultural developments Douthat decries all that new. He complains about the \u201cexchanging Protestant rigor for a post-Christian Social Gospel and a soft pantheism.\u201d But Jane Addams, an uber-WASP, adhered to the Social Gospel tradition more than a century before Bush died. Henry Wallace, the WASP vice-president of Franklin Roosevelt, perhaps the WASPiest of all Presidents, was an adherent to New Age spiritualism in the 1940s.\n\nThe trajectory of the Bush family itself hardly illustrates a story of decline. George H. W. Bush was the son of a Senator who became President and had two sons who achieved great political success, one as a governor and the other as both a governor and president. Bush progeny continue to dot the land in positions of high authority: Neil Bush runs a foundation, Marvin Bush is a partner in an investment firm, George P. Bush is Texas land commissioner, Jenna Bush was a a contributor on NBC\u2019s Today Show, Ashley Bush produces movies. This is not a family that has been marginalized.\n\nDouthat\u2019s column echoes a familiar conservative lament: the displacement of aristocratic legitimacy by modernity. \u201cBut the age of chivalry is gone\u201d Edmund Burke sighed in 1790 in Reflections on the Revolution in France. \u201cThat of sophisters, economists, and calculators has succeeded; and the glory of Europe is extinguished forever.\u201d One of Douthat\u2019s favorite novelists, Anthony Powell, told the same story (although arguably with less of a normative bent) in his twelve-volume epic Dance to the Music of Time (1951-1975) which traces the triumph of the grubby go-getter Kenneth Widmerpool over the languid but charming members of the gentry.\n\nBurke and Powell weren\u2019t offering history but rather myth. A necessary component of conservatism is the trope that traditional virtues are under siege, so conservative writers keep returning to the idea that the old ruling class is being displaced by their social inferiors, despite the fact that intergenerational inequality often persists for centuries. Douthat\u2019s column merely repeats the old myth with new examples."

    "text": "Though Aunt Elisabeth gathers that Professor Seeband has a daughter\u2014she appeals to his humanity by calling him \u201cPapa\u201d\u2014she doesn\u2019t know that her name is Elisabeth, too. Some years later, Kurt meets Ellie at the Dresden Art Academy. Though brunette, Ellie has the same alabaster glow and sparkling blue eyes as Kurt\u2019s Aunt Elisabeth. Ellie and Kurt quickly fall in love, and before long, Kurt finds himself with a cruel, controlling father-in-law, a former Nazi (though he doesn\u2019t know it yet) who has no interest in or respect for art. Unbeknownst to Kurt, he is also Aunt Elisabeth\u2019s murderer.\n\nDonnersmarck\u2019s film is only loosely based on Richter\u2014it\u2019s not announced as a biopic\u2014but many of the basic facts are, shockingly, true. Richter did have an aunt, Marianne, who was schizophrenic and forcibly sterilized, though she died of starvation in a concentration camp rather than in the gas chamber where Elisabeth perishes (and where Donnersmarck, to the chagrin of critics, dares to take his camera). In his thirties, Richter painted a famous canvas of Marianne as a young teen, holding him as an infant. His first wife was also named Marianne, though she went by Ema, and her father, Heinrich Eufinger, was an SS doctor who bore responsibility for the forced sterilization of some thousand women. Richter knew that his aunt died of starvation due to the Nazi eugenics campaign but was apparently unaware of the connection between his aunt and his father-in-law until an investigative journalist reported it in 2004. That Richter\u2019s personal history contained such traumatic historical entanglements seems almost unbelievably ill-fated and, because it\u2019s true, it demonstrates just how widespread the lingering effects of the Nazi period were. (Richter, for his part, told Der Spiegel that he has only seen the trailer for Never Look Away and found it \u201ctoo sensational.\u201d)\n\nToward the end of the film, Kurt produces a series of black-and-white paintings of photojournalism and family snapshots, blurred after the fact with horizontal strokes of a thick brush. Among these are paintings of young Kurt with his aunt Elisabeth; his uncle G\u00fcnther in a Wehrmacht uniform; his father-in-law\u2019s passport photos; an SS doctor, who was the head of the Nazi eugenics program, as he is led away in handcuffs. All of these individuals have deeply influenced Kurt\u2019s life; likewise, they are all entangled in the crimes of the Nazis.\n\nAt one point, a strong wind blows the shutters of Kurt\u2019s studio windows closed, causing a projection of his father-in-law\u2019s passport photo to overlap the unfinished painting of Kurt and his aunt. Just as chance made an indelible impact on Kurt\u2019s life, so it also plays a role in his art. Kurt makes these works after months of uncertain exploration, and it\u2019s clear that Donnersmarck intends for us to understand them as the moment that announces Kurt\u2019s artistic arrival.\n\nDonnersmarck gestures at the interplay of fate and creativity with the wind-blown shutters, but in his hands that bit of chance comes out as contrived. Indeed, he ignores the fact that Richter tried to obscure the origin of his photos, in order to divorce their original meaning from that of images he rendered in paint. Richter wanted to paint the photographs, he says, partly because he saw them as \u201cworks without an author.\u201d (This phrase, \u201cWerk ohne Autor,\u201d serves as the German title of the film.) As Richter told Michael Kimmelman in a 2002 interview,\n\nWhen I first started to do this in the 60s, people laughed. I clearly showed that I painted from photographs. It seemed so juvenile. The provocation was purely formal\u2014that I was making paintings like photographs. Nobody asked about what was in the pictures. Nobody asked who my Aunt Marianne was. That didn\u2019t seem to be the point.\n\nToward the end of the film, Kurt says at a press conference that the tender family photographs are random, that he plucked the passport photos from a photo booth. Asked about the meaning of his work, Kurt demurs again. \u201cMy works are smarter than I am,\u201d Richter has said, and Kurt repeats it here. \u201cI\u2019m not making any statements, I\u2019m making pictures,\u201d Kurt emphasizes.\n\nNever Look Away is perhaps too epic, too ambitious, eager to make grand statements rather than to find poignancy and authenticity in one story.\n\nRichter\u2019s work wasn\u2019t expressly about making bold statements about history, his own or his country\u2019s. He used the same blurred, photorealist techniques for numerous other subjects: curtains, cows, his children. Some of these\u2014a clownish rendering of his father and his dog, his wife\u2019s family on vacation at the sea\u2014can be read as documents of a corrupted history, but they\u2019re also just snapshots, moments in any ordinary life. Richter\u2019s work suggests that every family has its share of hidden traumas, that all historical and personal memories are conflicted.\n\nBy contrast, Donnersmarck wants to make bold, historical statements, and that is where his film about art falters. At times, Never Look Away feels like a hulking, even unwelcome example of Vergangenheitsbew\u00e4ltigung. Turning over the past is such a ubiquitous activity in Germany as to have become something of a clich\u00e9 there, and Germans have developed high standards for when it is useful and when it is earned. It\u2019s telling that Never Look Away hasn\u2019t been well received in Germany, where reviewers accuse Donnersmarck of sacrificing historical accuracy and ambiguity in pursuit of something big: the headline-grabbing Major Themes of Nazis and the GDR; another Oscar. Never Look Away is perhaps too epic, too ambitious, eager to make grand statements rather than to find poignancy and authenticity in one story.\n\nAnd yet, Donnersmarck touches on something elemental about how biography, inspiration, and history can combine to create something of lasting value. In spite of Richter\u2019s protests, it is part of what gives his photo portraits their frisson. At one point in the film, Kurt\u2019s professor, Antonius van Verten, a stand-in for Joseph Beuys, falters in one of his lectures. In a moment of uncertainty before dismissing his students, he asks if anyone has something to contribute. Kurt bravely raises his hand. He\u2019s been thinking about lotto numbers, he says: a group of digits that are utterly meaningless\u2014until luck, or some mathematical probability, makes them significant. The events of the past, even coincidence, aren\u2019t always significant, he suggests, but they can become meaningful.\n\n"

      "Jeet Heer"
    ],
    "text": "In the last few days, journalistic eulogies have abounded for George H. W. Bush, who died at the age of 94 on Friday night. It\u2019s established tradition for honoring former presidents. But as Jon Allsop points out in The Columbia Journalism Review, the warm remembrances of Bush also display a distinct trend: evaluating the forty-first president specifically as a foil who highlights the perceived failings of the current commander in chief.\n\nCoverage of Bush\u2019s life, Allsop notes, has been \u201cdominated by favorable comparisons to President Trump. Bush\u2019s death, much like McCain\u2019s before him, became a metaphor for the death of civility in politics. A warm letter Bush wrote his successor, Bill Clinton, was held up as an artifact of bipartisan comity, as BuzzFeed\u2019s Anne Helen Petersen noted in an insightful post. Many outlets highlighted Bush\u2019s broad public popularity ... And on cable news, in particular, commentators portrayed Bush as an honorable man who did politics the nice way. On CNN, Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff under Bush, summed up much coverage when he said, \u2018Politics need not be mean and nasty, and he lived by that.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere are genuine reasons to praise Bush. Although he could be brutally demagogic when running for office\u2014aside from the racist \u201cWillie Horton\u201d ad released by his allies, Bush\u2019s 1988 campaign relied on the portrayal of Bush as a true American who loved the Pledge of Allegiance, as opposed to the unpatriotic \u201cGreek\u201d Michael Dukakis\u2014Bush was an institutionalist who tried to make government work. That meant reaching across the aisle and working with Democrats in a way that now seems inconceivable, leading to the passage of Americans With Disability Act, the amendment of Clean Air Act, and accepting tax increases to lower the deficit. Bush\u2019s institutionalist instincts also stood him in good stead in foreign policy, where he dealt with world-changing events like the end of the Cold War and Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait by deftly deploying alliances and international organizations like NATO and the United Nations.\n\nAt the core of Bush nostalgia, Franklin Foer argues in The Atlantic, is a yearning for an older, more responsible \u201cEstablishment.\u201d Specifically, an older elite, \u201chardened in the cold of New England boarding schools, acculturated by the late-night rituals of Skull and Bones, sent off to the world with a sense of noblesse oblige,\u201d Foer writes. \u201cFor more than a century, this Establishment resided at the top of the American caste system. Now it is gone, and apparently people wish it weren\u2019t.\u201d"

    "text": "Figures from the American left widely criticized Whitaker\u2019s appointment, citing his criticism of the Russia investigation and reports that he\u2019s acted as a \u201cspy\u201d of sorts for the White House inside DOJ. But the consensus against Whitaker also crosses ideological lines. Alberto Gonzales, who served as George W. Bush\u2019s second attorney general, said the decision to install Whitaker over a Senate-confirmed official \u201cconfounds me.\u201d Michael Mukasey, Bush\u2019s third attorney general, told reporters that he thought the move was a mistake. \u201cEven Richard Nixon didn\u2019t put in somebody as acting attorney general who had not been confirmed,\u201d he remarked to USA Today.\n\nThe most forceful critique came from Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general in the Obama administration, and George Conway, a prominent conservative lawyer and the husband of White House adviser Kellyanne Conway. \u201cSenate confirmation exists for a simple, and good, reason,\u201d the two men argued in a New York Times op-ed. \u201cConstitutionally, Matthew Whitaker is a nobody.\u201d\n\nThe question is how the justices feel about this. Imagine, if you will, that you are a sitting justice on the Supreme Court of the United States. You\u2019re passionate about your work. You care about the institution that you and eight of your colleagues are charged with maintaining. You cherish the American rule of law and the federal judiciary\u2019s role in protecting it. And you\u2019re disturbed by what you\u2019ve seen over the last few years.\n\nJudicial confirmations are more contentious and vitriolic than at any other point in the nation\u2019s history. They\u2019ve become a \u201chighly partisan show,\u201d in the words of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and the \u201cterribly polarized political process\u201d undermines the court\u2019s legitimacy, in the words of Justice Elena Kagan. The corrosive battle to seat Justice Brett Kavanaugh this fall did lasting damage to the court\u2019s image as a neutral, independent arbiter of the law. His disturbing tirade against the Clintons and the left, coupled with his suggestions that \u201cwhat comes around, goes around,\u201d still rings in many Americans\u2019 ears.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not just the legislative branch that\u2019s undermining the courts, either. President Donald Trump so far has largely treated the rule of law as a sword to be wielded against his enemies. (\u201cLock her up!\u201d the campaign chant went.) He regularly denounces federal judges who issue unremarkable rulings against him, sometimes in racist terms. His Justice Department is abusing procedural mechanisms to skip past the appellate courts and bring issues to your docket directly, apparently hoping you\u2019ll give his legally dubious acts the rubber-stamp treatment he desires.\n\nWhat\u2019s a troubled Supreme Court justice like you to do? The easiest move would be to keep doing your job and ignore the fleeting political fights that swirl around the courts. Presidents have been frustrated by the judiciary in the past. They\u2019ve even offered pointed criticism of judges who\u2019ve ruled against them. Their critiques are ultimately fleeting. A president faces regular elections and term limits. You have lifetime tenure.\n\nYou might still feel a gnawing sense of unease that this time is different, though. Trump is arguably more authoritarian than any of his predecessors, even Nixon at the height of Watergate. During that constitutional crisis, the justices unanimously intervened to demand the president turn over the White House tapes and other subpoenaed documents to the courts. Foremost among their fears was that Nixon would exploit any dissenting opinions to defy a ruling to turn over the White House tapes.\n\nThere are good reasons for the court to weigh in now. The acting attorney general is regularly sued in his official capacity and could face potential legal challenges in each of those cases. By tackling the matter on their own, the justices could prevent any confusion among the lower courts. While the Supreme Court typically waits for those divisions to emerge before weighing in, there\u2019s nothing procedurally improper about Goldstein\u2019s challenge, so the court has an opportunity to prevent chaos before it can occur.\n\nIn practical terms, a ruling against Whitaker would be a slap on the wrist. The Justice Department would continue to function under Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein or any other Senate-confirmed official currently working there. Trump would be also be free to nominate an attorney general for the Senate to consider. This turn of events might hinder Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine the Russia investigation as it draws closer to his inner circle, of course. But that\u2019s not exactly a good reason for the court to step aside.\n\nThe decision\u2019s real impact would be political in nature, which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. It would signal that the court is willing to impose meaningful checks on this president\u2014a duty that it has so far failed to carry out\u2014as well as others. It would strengthen the Justice Department\u2019s traditional independence from the White House\u2014a norm, not a constitutional requirement, but a valuable norm nonetheless. It would help restore some of the high court\u2019s flagging prestige, setting it apart in an age of institutional disenchantment. And it would teach a president who is used to a certain level of impunity from the political system that there are consequences to his actions.\n\nIn the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton wrote that the federal judiciary has \u201cneither force nor will, but merely judgment.\u201d Indeed, the Supreme Court cannot compel Trump to believe in the rule of law. Nor can it rewrite the laws to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller from undue interference. But it can emphatically and clearly say what the law is. In this case, that may be enough."

    "text": "The U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan told a federal court on Friday that President Donald Trump\u2019s former legal counsel should receive a \u201csubstantial term of imprisonment\u201d after he pleaded guilty to charges related to tax evasion, fraud, and campaign-finance violations in August. But in a separate filing, special counsel Robert Mueller praised Cohen\u2019s cooperation with his own office\u2019s investigation and recommended leniency.\n\nCohen previously told the court that he cooperated with the investigations out of a sense of \u201cpersonal resolve.\u201d But federal prosecutors disputed that characterization, noting that Cohen only reached out to the special counsel\u2019s office in August when he realized he was about to be indicted by the Manhattan office. \u201cAs such, any suggestion by Cohen that his meetings with law enforcement reflect a selfless and unprompted about-face are overstated,\u201d the Manhattan office told the court. They recommended that he serve roughly three-and-a-half years in prison.\n\nTwo of the offenses to which Cohen pleaded guilty involved hush-money payments aimed at suppressing accounts of Trump\u2019s extramarital affairs with two women. Those payments, prosecutors said, violated federal campaign-finance laws by exceeding donation limits. The Manhattan office directly linked those payments to the president in Friday\u2019s filing, telling the court that Cohen \u201cacted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1,\u201d the prosecutors\u2019 pseudonym for Trump. (Cohen himself made a similar assertion during his plea hearing in August.)\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s office, on the other hand, offered a more laudatory account of Cohen\u2019s cooperation with the Russia investigation. Cohen pleaded guilty last month to lying to Congress about his role in negotiating Russian real-estate deals for the Trump Organization during the 2016 campaign. Mueller told the court on Friday that Cohen had taken \u201csignificant steps to mitigate his criminal conduct\u201d and provided \u201ccredible and consistent information\u201d to investigators over the course of seven meetings.\n\nMueller offered few clues about what the president\u2019s former lawyer offered in the Russia investigation. Friday\u2019s filing asserted that Cohen gave \u201cuseful information concerning certain discrete Russia-related matters core to its investigation that he obtained by virtue of his regular contact with Company executives during the campaign.\u201d The special counsel\u2019s office also said that Cohen \u201cprovided relevant and useful information concerning his contacts with persons connected to the White House during the 2017\u20132018 time period.\u201d\n\nThose vague descriptions may prompt a wave of unease among members of Trump\u2019s inner circle, many of whom have already given their version of events to federal investigators and congressional committees. Among those under the most intense scrutiny is Donald Trump Jr., a high-ranking Trump organization executive. California Representative Jackie Speier, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Friday that she believed the president\u2019s son may have lied to Congress twice about Russia-related matters. She did not specify what she believes he lied about.\n\n"

The dispute arose when Lewandowski felt that Florida Senate President Bill Galvano and Florida state Senator Jeff Brandes weren\u2019t appreciative enough of the impact of Trump\u2019s campaigning in Florida in the midterms: \u201cLewandowski became more aggressive, witnesses said, prompting Brandes to stand up and wag his finger at Lewandowski.

In March 2016, while serving as campaign manager, Lewandowski grabbed a female reporter, Michelle Fields, by the arm. The case was investigated by the police but charges were not pursued. On February 2018, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly got into a scuffle with Lewandowski.

Mr. Kelly grabbed Mr. Lewandowski by his collar, trying to push him against a wall, according to a person with direct knowledge of the episode.\u201d\n\nIn October 2018, Kelly got into a profanity-laden argument with National Security Advisor John Bolton. As Bloomberg reported, \u201cThe shouting match was so intense that other White House aides worried one of the two men might immediately resign.\u201d\n\nIn November 2017, Kelly reportedly got into a near fistfight with an ICE official who the president had invited into the White House.\n\nTrump himself seems to encourage this behavior by the rhetorical sanction he gives to violence\u2014as when he seemed to give his stamp of approval to Congressman Montana Congressman Greg Gianforte for bodyslamming a reporter."

According to the newspaper, the Harris campaign \u201clisted an obligation of $34,310 for \u2018reimbursement payment for Bladen absentee, early voting poll workers; reimbursement door to door,\u201d owed to the Red Dome Group. \u201cRed Dome Group, in turn, contracted with L.

The announcement came one month to the day after the ouster of Jeff Sessions, who held the post for the first two years of Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nBarr will be a familiar face at the Justice Department: He previously served as attorney general from 1991 to 1993 under President George H. W. Bush. During that tenure, he carved out a reputation as a tough-on-crime conservative with an expansive view of executive power, making him a natural choice for a president who favors stark, unilateral policy decisions.\n\nAs attorney general, Barr will wield enormous influence over the machinery of federal law enforcement, its criminal-justice policies, and the nation\u2019s immigration courts. But he may ultimately receive the most attention for his handling of the Russia investigation under special counsel Robert Mueller. Barr\u2019s full views on the inquiry itself are not yet known. However, he will likely receive intense scrutiny from senators for a Washington Post op-ed he wrote last year defending Trump\u2019s decision to fire then-FBI Director James Comey.\n\nSince the Watergate crisis, the Justice Department has traditionally kept a degree of independence from the White House and its political operations. Trump has frequently challenged this norm, asserting in public and in private that he would be willing to take personal command of the department\u2019s investigative functions and use them to pursue his political opponents. Whether Barr will safeguard the Russia investigation and the Justice Department\u2019s nonpartisanship will be a key question in his confirmation hearings. Under the precedent set by Attorney General Elliot Richardson during Watergate, senators have every right to demand his sworn pledge to maintain the department\u2019s independence before elevating him to the post."

The newspaper documents that at the end of 2016, after Trump\u2019s victory was announced, and into the early 2017, the Washington-based lobbyists Qorvis/MSLGroup, which has a longstanding relationship with the Saudi government, booked 500 rooms in the Trump hotel in the nation\u2019s capital, ostensibly in support of veterans groups who were lobbying against the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act.\n\nThe veterans who were brought to Washington were told that the new law was bad for those who served abroad. Some of these veterans claim they were not told that their lavish trips to Washington were being paid by Saudi Arabia.\n\nMilitary veteran Dan Cord noted that the free-spending at the events was remarkable. \u201cWe\u2019ve done hundreds of veterans events, and we\u2019ve stayed in Holiday Inns and eaten Ritz Crackers and lemonade. And we\u2019re staying in this hotel that costs $500 a night,\u201d Cord told The Washington Post. \u201cI\u2019d never seen anything like this. They were like, \u2018That\u2019s what\u2019s so cool!

This lackluster planning suggests the purpose of the lobbying might be for reasons other than simply changing the law.\n\nSpeaking on MSNBC, Jake Sullivan, former national security advisor to former Vice President Joe Biden, said, \u201cWhat it basically says is that Donald Trump has put his family business ahead of the nation\u2019s business and for the American people that basically means national security is being put up to the highest bidders.\u201d"

According to the news agency, the decision was \u201cmade hastily, without consulting his national security team or allies, and over strong objections from virtually everyone involved in the fight against the Islamic State group, according to U.S. and Turkish officials.\u201d\n\nOne of the surprising details of the report is that Erdogan himself was taken aback at how successful he was in convincing Trump on the Syrian matter. Before the phone call, the consensus position that the Trump administration had reached, backed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, was that Trump would tell Erdogan to back off from his threats to attack Kurdish forces in Syria.\n\nBut during the phone conversation, Trump threw away the script and agreed with his Turkish counterpart. As AP relates, Trump started by reiterating the message of backing off. But then a change occurred:\n\nErdogan, though, quickly put Trump on the defensive, reminding him that he had repeatedly said the only reason for U.S. troops to be in Syria was to defeat the Islamic State and that the group had been 99 percent defeated. \u201cWhy are you still there?\u201d the second official said Erdogan asked Trump, telling him that the Turks could deal with the remaining IS militants.\n\nTrump then posed Erdogan\u2019s question to his National Security Advisor John Bolton, who was participating in the phone call. Bolton admitted that the Islamic State had indeed lost 99 per cent of its territory but said that it was in America\u2019s interest to make sure the group did not enjoy a resurgence.\n\nTrump was not dissuaded, according to the officials, who said the president quickly capitulated by pledging to withdraw, shocking both Bolton and Erdogan. Caught off guard, Erdogan cautioned Trump against a hasty withdrawal, according to one official. While Turkey has made incursions into Syria in the past, it does not have the necessary forces mobilized on the border to move in and hold the large swaths of northeastern Syria where U.S. troops are positioned, the official said.\n\nFrom this reporting, it seems likely that it was never Erdogan\u2019s intention to get the United States to withdraw. Rather he made the demand as a bargaining move, to get other, lesser goals. Trump, displaying his mastery of the art of the deal, gave in to Erdogan\u2019s maximum position.\n\nThe White House denies the accuracy of AP\u2019s account."

But McChrystal himself raises the deeper problem, which is that there\u2019s no plausible answer to American soldiers as to why they should fight for a war with so murky a purpose.

    "text": "The New York Times has published a detailed profile of Victorina Morales, an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala who has worked since 2013 at the president\u2019s golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey. Morales maintains that management knew about her immigration status when she was hired and on one occasion helped her acquire fake documents.\n\nMorales entered the United States in 1999. When Morales was hired in 2013, she told her supervisor she didn\u2019t have \u201cgood papers.\u201d She was told to just bring the papers she used for her previous employment. In 2017, after Donald Trump had won the presidency running on a nativist campaign, Morales and other employees where given a new handbook saying that if they were found with improper documents they could lose their jobs.\n\n\n\nThat same year, a manager told her she needed a new green card and social security number since the ones she had given before had problems. Morales told her manager, \u201cI don\u2019t know where to get them.\u201d\n\nAs The New York Times relates her story:\n\nThe manager, she said, suggested she speak with a maintenance employee who he said knew where to acquire new documents. When the maintenance employee told her that the new papers would cost $165, Ms. Morales told the manager that she did not have the money. \u201cHe said, \u2018don\u2019t worry. I will lend you the money,\u2019\u201d she said. Ms. Morales said the maintenance worker drove her to a house in Plainfield, N.J., where she waited in his car while he met with someone inside. Ms. Morales said that she had no record or recollection of the address. The next day, she said, the maintenance worker brought her a new Social Security card and a realistic-looking green card to replace the one that had \u201cexpired.\u201d She said the manager made copies of them for files kept at the club\u2019s administrative headquarters.\n\nMorales\u2019s manager may have been trying to help her out, but the actions of the organization stand in sharp contrast to Donald Trump\u2019s fierce anti-immigrant rhetoric, which goes after not just undocumented immigrants but also calls for cutting back on legal immigration.\n\nSince Trump entered politics in 2015, Morales has been appalled by his xenophobia. \u201cWe are tired of the abuse, the insults, the way he talks about us when he knows that we are here helping him make money,\u201d Morales told The New York Times. \u201cWe sweat it out to attend to his every need and have to put up with his humiliation.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times piece contains multiple anecdotes from Morales and others showing their close and largely cordial interactions with Trump during his stays at the golf club."

As Politico notes, the administration has no United Nations ambassador and deputy National Security Advisor while the posts of attorney general and administrator of the Environmental Protection agency are being done by acting heads that have not been confirmed. The fate of Chief of Staff John Kelly remains up in the air.\n\n\u201cThe result is an administration in a holding pattern,\u201dPolitico concludes. \u201cTrump has offered almost nothing in the way of a legislative vision for 2019 beyond approval of a new trade deal and vague references to infrastructure. His only clear priority is enforcing border security. The White House has even sent mixed signals about its desire to fight for a criminal justice reform bill that Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, played a key role in shaping.\u201d\n\nWriting in The Atlantic, Elaina Plott makes a parallel point about the White House\u2019s lack of any systematic strategy for handling the Mueller probe. \u201cNobody knows how the White House plans to respond to the Mueller report\u2014including the people who work at the White House,\u201d Plott observes. \u201cThe lack of planning for potential outcomes of one of the highest-stakes investigations of the past two years illuminates many of the key operating principles of this White House\u2014a follow-the-leader approach, a frequent resort to denial, and a staff constantly in flux. Many of those tactics have allowed Trump to maintain favor with his base, but Mueller\u2019s report will represent the biggest test yet of how they fare against legal, rather than political, challenges.\u201d\n\nA source told Plott, \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Jesus, take the wheel,\u2019 but scarier.\u201d\n\nOne symptom of this lack of a ready response is the failure of Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s lawyer, to deliver on his promised a \u201ccounter-report\u201d to the Mueller investigation. As Jonathan Chait notes in New York, from July until the present, Giuliani has reneged on his promised response.

    ],
    "text": "Though the Trump Organization has promised that all profits received from foreign governments at these properties will be donated to the Treasury, ethics experts dispute the methods used for calculating these profits, suggesting that the president continues to profit from foreign spending. Several of Trump\u2019s most influential backers\u2013such as Broidy or the investor Tom Barrack\u2014also profit handsomely from business ties and interests in the Gulf States.\n\nThe secrecy surrounding Trump\u2019s financial affairs makes it difficult to know exactly how extensive these ties are. During the firestorm following Khashoggi\u2019s death, Trump tweeted that he had no financial interests in Saudi Arabia. As various journalists noted, the statement could be technically true\u2014in other words, no investments physically located within the country\u2019s boundaries\u2014while still misleading, given the Trump hotels\u2019 many Saudi customers. And as always, Trump\u2019s family members further complicate the picture. Over the last few years, for example, the Kushner family\u2019s attempts to refinance or sell their disastrous New York real estate holdings included a failed attempt to secure funding from Qatar\u2013a fact that\u2019s hard not to see as relevant when evaluating Kushner\u2019s unusual hostility toward Doha.\n\nTo be sure, money is not the only thing that ties the Trump administration so closely to the Gulf states. As with any administration, personality plays a role. The Saudis gave Trump the red-carpet treatment during his trip to Riyadh last year, a key element in winning over the mercurial president. Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, has reportedly built a friendship with Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nMoreover, there is some genuine policy affinity between the two sides. From Michael Flynn to John Bolton, the Trump administration has been replete with the kind of Iran hawks that delight policymakers in the Gulf. Meanwhile, the administration\u2019s notoriously pro-Israel and pro-Likud stance has been helpful as the Gulf states try to build a stronger regional partnership with Israel against Iran.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Mueller\u2019s investigation will untangle the web of money tying the Trump administration to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But the network has clearly produced dividends: an administration that is almost reflexively supportive of every key Saudi foreign policy priority.\n\nTake Iran, where Trump has withdrawn the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, reimposed sanctions and cracked down on U.S. allies in Europe and Asia. His decision to end the nuclear deal was opposed by other U.S. allies, China, Russia, most arms-control and regional specialists, and even his own secretary of defense and secretary of state; it was, however, supported by Saudi and Emirati leaders, who oppose Iran\u2019s regional influence, and were willing to fill the gap by boosting their own production in response to sanctions on Iranian oil.\n\nThe president also idiosyncratically backed Saudi interests during the Gulf Cooperation Council crisis which broke out in 2017. As Saudi Arabia and the UAE blockaded Qatar, Trump tweeted his strong support. Again, administration officials like Defense Secretary James Mattis\u2013likely mindful of the thousands of U.S. troops currently stationed inside Qatar\u2013opposed the blockade, and sought to mediate an end to the crisis. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson even intervened to try to prevent a Saudi invasion of Qatar. Leaked emails later suggested that for his trouble, both the Emiratis and the Saudis used their influence with the president (and with Kushner) to have him fired.\n\nThe administration has displayed unwavering support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, an ongoing humanitarian disaster. It continues to arm and aid the Saudi-led coalition, despite repeated reports of Saudi war crimes. Even the recent decision to end refueling support for the campaign came only after sustained congressional and public pressure, and the threat of a congressional rebuke on the topic. Indeed, the administration has actively worked with congressional leadership to shut down bills that would end U.S. support for the conflict.\n\nArms sales are another area where the Gulf States have benefited during the Trump administration. Though the president himself likes to portray such sales as vital to the United States economy, the actual financial and job-related benefits are small. Instead, these sales are hugely beneficial to the Saudi government, allowing them access advanced weapons and to replenish armament stocks. Recent reports suggest that Kushner even pushed to inflate the reported value of arms sales to the Kingdom in order to further bolster the partnership.\n\nPerhaps the most striking indication of the administration\u2019s excessive willingness to bend to Saudi interests is in its refusal to criticize the murder of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and U.S. resident killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. In any other administration, this action would have drawn clear condemnation and policy response. In the Trump era, the administration has displayed skepticism towards its own intelligence agencies, while maintaining its support for Saudi leaders.\n\nTo what extent were any of these decisions the direct result of money and influence from the Gulf States? It\u2019s impossible to say. For starters, we may never know the extent of the financial ties between Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Trump\u2019s businesses, family, and donors. Though Mueller\u2019s report may eventually clarify some of these questions, much of it lies outside the expected scope of the investigation. It\u2019s unclear whether other lawsuits\u2014such as one targeting Trump\u2019s businesses as violating the emoluments clause of the constitution\u2014will be successful in subpoenaing records on this question.\n\nMore importantly, though, it\u2019s difficult to distinguish influence during the Trump administration from general attempts by these states to buy policymaking influence here in D.C. As a recent report from the Center for International Policy (CIP) illustrated, Saudi lobbying in Washington has grown exponentially in recent years, costing $27.3 million in 2017 alone. In addition to the money that goes to traditional lobbyists, Saudi funding goes to think tanks, universities, and other institutions which can influence U.S. foreign policy.\n\nDespite rules on foreign election funding, at least some of that money even goes to politicians: The CIP report suggests that more than one-third of the congressmen contacted by lobbying firms like the Glover Park Group or DLA Piper on behalf of Saudi Arabia later received a campaign contribution from a registered foreign agent at the firm\u2014in other words, a U.S. citizen, but one paid by a foreign government. As the report notes, \u201cwhile it\u2019s true that foreign nationals are prohibited from making contributions to political campaigns, there\u2019s a simple work-around, one the Saudis obviously made use of big time \u2026 just hire a local lobbyist to do it for them.\u201d\n\nThe presence of this foreign money sloshing around in Washington raises serious concerns for the independence of U.S. foreign policy. Even in the absence of a clear quid pro quo, the Trump family benefits financially from its ties to the Gulf states. Adam Schiff, incoming chair of the House Intelligence Committee, has promised to probe these ties, though it\u2019s likely impossible to tell the extent to which money\u2014rather than personal factors or policy agreement\u2014is driving Trump\u2019s foreign policy decisions.\n\nNo one, however, can deny that money plays a role. Even as Mueller finishes his work, therefore, one thing is already clear: It\u2019s not just Russian meddling in U.S. foreign policy that we should be concerned about."

Accounts differ on whether the situation is caused by declining circulation or whether the owner, MediaDC, wants to shutter The Weekly Standard so they can mine its circulation list to build up a planned new publication, a weekly edition of The Washington Examiner.\n\nThis move has inevitable political implications. The Weekly Standard is the most vociferously anti-Trump of all major conservative outlets. The Washington Examiner is much less critical and more inclined to follow the Republican party line. As one anonymous source told CNN, \u201cthey\u2019re expanding the pro-Trump magazine that does what the owners want, while threatening closing of an independent magazine that has its own history and identity.\u201d A Vox article quotes a source saying, \u201cThis is not about dwindling subscribers. This is about strip-mining TWS for its assets.\u201d\n\n\n\nSome liberals and leftists are gloating over the possible demise of the neoconservative journal.\n\nIt's really important that we keep The Weekly Standard around, because we need conservative voices that are opposed to Trump's outright lying, phony populism, jingoistic demagoguery and outright ignorance and denial of life and death matters pic.twitter.com/1Mbvjbxo9E \u2014 Will\ud83e\udd95Menaker (@willmenaker) December 5, 2018\n\nI enjoy the Woke Bill Kristol Twitter persona, but the fact remains that neocon ideas get a lot more people killed than Trumpy nonsense. https://t.co/PKSL14bTjW \u2014 Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias) December 5, 2018\n\nFounded in 1995 by William Kristol and Fred Barnes, the magazine will certainly be remembered in history as the main cheerleader for the hawkish foreign policy of President George W. Bush. In that capacity, the journal promoted many dubious ideas, notably the theory that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nBut The Weekly Standard has also been a magazine that appreciates well-turned phrases and crafted journalism. It\u2019s given room to many fine writers, notably Andrew Ferguson, Matt Labash, Gertrude Himmelfarb, Joseph Epstein and Cynthia Ozick. The cultural coverage in the magazine has been particularly thoughtful. Labash\u2019s hilarious profile of dirty tricks master Roger Stone stands as a representative example of The Weekly Standard at its best.\n\nIf the magazine shutters, the world will not only lose yet another outlet for consistently good writing; in addition, the lesson conservative writers will likely draw from its closure is that you should never challenge the Republican consensus and you should avoid criticizing Donald Trump. It\u2019s hard to see how leftist Schadenfreude at this news is anything but seriously misguided: Whatever replaces The Weekly Standard is almost certain to be much worse."

But in the United States and Europe\u2014the second- and third-largest emitters in the world, respectively\u2014automobiles are among the leading culprits. \u201cWe thought oil use had peaked in the U.S. and Europe 15 years ago,\u201d one of the study\u2019s authors, Rob Jackson, told The New York Times. \u201cThe cheap gasoline prices, bigger cars and people driving more miles are boosting oil use at rates that none of us expected.\u201d\n\nTransportation recently became the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States. Rhodium Group\n\nCars are becoming as big of a threat to the climate as coal-fired power. The transportation sector is now the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States, and has been for two years.

Governments could require carmakers to improve fuel efficiency (though President Donald Trump recently announced plans to roll back such requirements in the United States). They could invest in infrastructure for electric cars. And cities and towns could improve their public transportation systems. But the only sure solution, right now, is for the world to drive less."

In November\u2019s midterm elections, voters across the country handed the Democratic Party 40 House seats, control of multiple state legislatures, and an assortment of governorships and other state offices. Now, one month later, GOP lawmakers in multiple states are using lame-duck sessions to hamstring incoming Democratic elected officials, either by reducing their official powers or transferring them to Republican-led legislatures.\n\nMuch has been written about Trumpism and the threat it poses to American democratic governance, and rightly so.

One proposal would give state lawmakers the legal standing to defend laws in court when the attorney general declines to do so.

    "text": "The Associated Press is reporting that President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria crystallized during a December 14 phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. According to the news agency, the decision was \u201cmade hastily, without consulting his national security team or allies, and over strong objections from virtually everyone involved in the fight against the Islamic State group, according to U.S. and Turkish officials.\u201d\n\nOne of the surprising details of the report is that Erdogan himself was taken aback at how successful he was in convincing Trump on the Syrian matter. Before the phone call, the consensus position that the Trump administration had reached, backed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, was that Trump would tell Erdogan to back off from his threats to attack Kurdish forces in Syria.\n\nBut during the phone conversation, Trump threw away the script and agreed with his Turkish counterpart. As AP relates, Trump started by reiterating the message of backing off. But then a change occurred:\n\nErdogan, though, quickly put Trump on the defensive, reminding him that he had repeatedly said the only reason for U.S. troops to be in Syria was to defeat the Islamic State and that the group had been 99 percent defeated. \u201cWhy are you still there?\u201d the second official said Erdogan asked Trump, telling him that the Turks could deal with the remaining IS militants.\n\nTrump then posed Erdogan\u2019s question to his National Security Advisor John Bolton, who was participating in the phone call. Bolton admitted that the Islamic State had indeed lost 99 per cent of its territory but said that it was in America\u2019s interest to make sure the group did not enjoy a resurgence.\n\nTrump was not dissuaded, according to the officials, who said the president quickly capitulated by pledging to withdraw, shocking both Bolton and Erdogan. Caught off guard, Erdogan cautioned Trump against a hasty withdrawal, according to one official. While Turkey has made incursions into Syria in the past, it does not have the necessary forces mobilized on the border to move in and hold the large swaths of northeastern Syria where U.S. troops are positioned, the official said.\n\nFrom this reporting, it seems likely that it was never Erdogan\u2019s intention to get the United States to withdraw. Rather he made the demand as a bargaining move, to get other, lesser goals. Trump, displaying his mastery of the art of the deal, gave in to Erdogan\u2019s maximum position.\n\nThe White House denies the accuracy of AP\u2019s account."

    "text": "On Monday night, a Washington fixture met the woman at the center of one of the Trump era\u2019s most salacious scandals when Sally Quinn hosted an event at Politics and Prose bookstore in D.C. to promote Stormy Daniels\u2019s Full Disclosure. BuzzFeed News reporter Lissandra Villa described it as a packed event that drew an audience of 200 guests, creating a \u201ctoasty\u201d room where at least one person seems to have fainted.\n\nDaniels was the star attraction, given her legal struggles against her alleged one-time lover, President Donald Trump. But Quinn was an equally interesting choice as a host. Quinn, who currently blogs on religion, has been important as both a writer and a social figure, a hostess whose social gatherings are the center of Washington community life.\n\nIt was as the voice of the Washington establishment that Quinn penned a famous 1998 column condemning Bill Clinton for the Monica Lewinsky scandal.\n\n\u201cWhen Establishment Washingtonians of all persuasions gather to support their own, they are not unlike any other small community in the country,\u201d Quinn wrote in The Washington Post. She added, \u201cWith some exceptions, the Washington Establishment is outraged by the president\u2019s behavior in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. The polls show that a majority of Americans do not share that outrage. Around the nation, people are disgusted but want to move on; in Washington, despite Clinton\u2019s gains with the budget and the Mideast peace talks, people want some formal acknowledgment that the president\u2019s behavior has been unacceptable.\u201d\n\nIf the Sally Quinn of 1998 took a moralistic stance on presidential misconduct, two decades later she is reacting differently to Trump\u2019s tabloid exploits, approaching Daniels\u2019s story in the spirit of reportorial curiosity. \u201cI\u2019ve watched Stormy\u2019s porn,\u201d Quinn revealed. \u201cIt\u2019s very good. She knows what she\u2019s doing.\u201d Asked about keeping her professional life separate from her personal life, Daniels said, \u201cPorn is about what looks good, and home sex is about what feels good.\u201d Daniels also fielded questions on ethics and feminism.\n\nAll in all, the audience seems to have been engaged with an illuminating evening, not least for showing the shifting ways Washington responds to sex scandals.\n\n\u201cYou have turned ethics and values and morals around, upside down, in this country,\u201d Quinn said at one point. \u201cYou\u2014Stormy Daniels the porn star\u2014are the one who is the ethical person.\u201d Daniels agreed: \u201cHow fucked up is that, yo?\u201d"
